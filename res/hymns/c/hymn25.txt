["1 He's the serving Savior, (Yes, He is!)\nComes to all the people (Everywhere)\nFull of deep compassion\nAnd sympathy! (What a Savior)", "2 Oh, what open love (to the needy ones)\nLots of tender love (to the little ones)\nTo the leprous one said,\nI am willing, be clean! (and He touched Him!)", "copyright  2012 Bible StorySongs, Inc. Used by permission.\nVisit BibleStorySongs.com to order CD's  Sheet Music."]
