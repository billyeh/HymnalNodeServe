["nonum Go, Jesus! Go, Jesus, go!\nTravel a circuit; You love man so!\nThrough the grain fields to a town;\nUp to the mountains, and then down!\nVisit a village, walk by the sea.\nEat in a house with people like me!\nAll around the countryside,\nYou're serving people far and wide!", "copyright  2012 Bible StorySongs, Inc.
