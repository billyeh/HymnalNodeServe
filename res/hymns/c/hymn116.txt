["1 Wonderful, wonderful!\nGod made me, wonderful!\nWhen I look, I can see I'm just fine;\nI'm designed perfectly.\nDon't need change, no siree!\nThis same face has been in style\na long, long time.", "2 Ears that hear-they're so dear,\nNose to smell-very well,\nAnd two eyes taking pictures\",\nconstantly.\nWith my mouth, I can feed,\nDrink and sing, and pray-read.\nThank you Lord you made me\nwonderfully!"]
