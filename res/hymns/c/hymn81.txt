["1 Jesus bids us shine with a clear, pure light,\nLike a little candle burning in the night;\nIn this world of darkness, we must shine,\nYou in your small corner and I in mine.", "2 Jesus bids us shine, then, for all around\nMany kinds of darkness in this world abound-\nSin and want and sorrow; we must shine,\nYou in your small corner, and I in mine."]
