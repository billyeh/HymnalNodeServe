["1 Two eyes to see all that my Lord has made,\nTwo ears to listen to His holy Word.\nTwo feet to run the way of righteousness,\nAnd my two hands for serving Christ my Lord.", "2 I have a mouth to praise the Lord of grace;\nI have a heart to love the Lord my God;\nI give myself, all that I am and have\nTo always love and serve the Lord my God."]
