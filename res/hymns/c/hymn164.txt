["1 \"Give,\" said the little stream,\n\"Give,\" oh, give, give, oh, give,\nGive,\" said the little stream,\nAs it hurried down the hill;\n\"I'm small, I know, but wherever I go,\nThe fields grow greener still.\"", "chorus Singing, singing all the day,\n\"Give away, oh, give away,\"\nSinging, singing all the day,\n\"Give, oh, give away.\"", "2 \"Give,\" said the little rain,\n\"Give, oh, give, give, oh, give,\nGive,\" said the little rain\nAs it fell upon the flowers.\n\"I'll raise their drooping heads again,\"\nAs it fell upon the flowers.", "3 \"Give,\" then, what you can give,\n\"Give, oh, give, give, oh, give,\nGive,\" then, what you can give,\nThere is something all can give.\nDo as the streams and blossoms do,\nAnd for other people live."]
