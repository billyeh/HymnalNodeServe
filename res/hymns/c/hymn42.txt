["1 Remember your Creator\nWhile you are young,\nAs a child, know the Scriptures\nAnd seek out God's truth.\nOh, remember your Creator\nWhile you are young,\nAnd let Him have a way\nIn the days of your youth.", "2 Remember your Creator\nWhile you are young.\nTo remember our Creator\nMeans to love Him.\nThe Lord is the Creator,\nOur source of life.\nIn the days of our youth\nWe would love only Him."]
