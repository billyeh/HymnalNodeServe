["1 So many times I was in weakness;\nI realize that was my blindness.\nI'm beginning to see\nAll that the Triune God is to me.", "2 Wasting my time looking at my poorness;\nNow my heart's eyes can behold His greatness.\nI'm enlightened to see\nAll of the Triune God is to me.", "chorus I believe, so I speak.\nI am strong, I have power.\nI believe, Oh Lord, Amen!\nI am strong, I have power.", "3 All of God's power for His creation,\nAnd all His might in incarnation,\nStrength to be crucified\nWhich by the power of God was supplied.", "4 And His great power in resurrection,\nHe wrought in Christ, even ascension!\nAll things He has subdued\nUnder His feet, by power overruled.", "5 Now in the church, in God's transmission,\nAll that He is, to His destination,\nHere constantly receive.\nHe is dispensed to us who believe.", "6 The Triune God is now transmitting\nHimself, this power, us energizing,\nIn us He is installed;\nThis dynamo within, the Triune God!"]
