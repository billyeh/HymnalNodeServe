["1 Shepherd, receive man,\nCome near and eat with them,\nPublicans and sinners.\nGo out to carry them home\nOn Your shoulders, rejoicing.\nLord, carry them home.", "2 Spirit, dear Spirit,\nWhere is the one lost coin?\nYes, You have the nine,\nBut the one You must find.\nDear Spirit, You're sweeping\nAll over the earth.", "3 Father, dear Father,\nHave mercy on mankind!\nHe's fallen to the pigs' pen.\nWhen will he return?\nDear Father, just kiss them,\nYour sons coming home.", "4 Father of mercy,\nClothe him with the best robe\nAnd kill the fatted calf\nAnd eat and be merry -\nHe was lost, but found,\nWas dead, but now he lives."]
