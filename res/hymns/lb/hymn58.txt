["1 Before we were saved, we were alone.\nThough so many others were with us,\nIn fact we were still by ourselves, alone.\nOnce we got saved we could never again\nBe alone by ourselves;\nSomeone has come, now wherever we go\nAnd whatever we do,\nJesus is here.\nAlways this other Person stays with us.", "2 Sometimes we are pleased that He remains.\nWe love Him and cherish Him, yet there\nAre times that we secretly wish He'd go.\nThis One, however our Christ we could\nNever escape or evade.\nThough we would tell Him to just go away\nAnd to leave us alone,\nJesus won't leave.\nIt is impossible to be alone.", "3 We're single no more; now we are two.\nFormerly we were just one by\nOurselves, but now Christ wants to be our life.\nOnce we got saved we could never again\nBe alone by ourselves;\nSomeone has come, now wherever we go\nAnd whatever we do,\nJesus is here.\nAlways this other Person stays with us.\nHe is our life."]
