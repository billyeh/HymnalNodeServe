["1 The greatest king on earth, that is King Solomon,\nFell in love with a country girl.\nThe king had to go to the countryside\nAnd become a country man,\nTo change his status,\nThat he could court her.\nIn His courtship with her\nShe was changed to be his match,\nTo become his queen and Shulammite,\nTo become his counterpart\nAnd become His loving bride.\nThis is the story of the Song of Songs.", "2 The Song of Songs depicts our story with God\nOf fallen man with the King of kings.\nBecause of His love for us,\nHe became a lowly man\nTo reach us and to die for our sins.\nThen in resurrection He\nRegenerated me\nAnd now we're daily being transformed.\nTo become the same as He with His life and nature\nTo become His counterpart, His match and bride."]
