["1 A lover of Christ should be one\nWho's attracted by His love\nAnd drawn by His sweetness\nTo pursue after Him, pursue after Him,\nPursue Him for full satisfaction.", "2 A lover of Christ should be one\nWho is called by Him\nTo be delivered\nFrom the self through His oneness\nWith the cross, with the cross of Christ.", "3 A lover of Christ should be one\nWho is called by Him to live in ascension\nAs the new creation, creation of God,\nIn the resurrection of Christ.", "4 A lover of Christ should be one\nWho's called by Him more strongly to live within\nThe veil, thru His cross after the lover's\nExperience of His resurrection."]
