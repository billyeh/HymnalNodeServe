["1 He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.\nOur life is a life that's in organic union.\nAs a branch is in the vine,\nGrafted, His life and mine intertwine.\nLord, I am joined to You!", "chorus One spirit with You;\nOne spirit, not two.\nLord, we are joined to You:\nOne spirit... with You.", "2 Through resurrection the Lord is now the Spirit.\nOur spirit by Him has been regenerated.\nThe Lord, the Spirit, mingling\nWith our spirit, is the most wondrous thing.\nOur spirit's mingled, Lord!", "3 Do you not know that our bodies\nare Christ's members?\nThis body's a temple of the Holy Spirit\nWho, from God, is now inside,\nOwning us that God may be glorified.\nLord, we've been bought by You!", "4 We are united with Christ in our spirit.\nHe dwells within us\nand makes His home in our heart,\nTo our body giving life,\nPurified to be a member of Christ;\nOur every part is Christ!"]
