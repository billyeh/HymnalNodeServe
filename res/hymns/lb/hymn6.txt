["1 And He showed me a river\nOf water of life,\nBright as crystal,\nProceeding out\nOf the throne of God\nAnd of the Lamb.\nAnd Thou shalt make them to drink\nOf the river of Thy pleasures.", "2 There is a river,\nThe streams whereof make glad.\nThe city of God.\nShe shall not be moved.\nGod shall help her.\nGod's in her midst.\nThey shall be abundantly satisfied\nWith the fatness of Thy house."]
