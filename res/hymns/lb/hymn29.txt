["1 As virgins we must be wise and pure,\nSo single to You, Lord to grow and mature.\nWe're going forth to meet You, our Bridegroom so sweet,\nOur touch with You, Jesus, must be intimate.", "chorus Lord, I love You above all,\nWatching hourly lest I fall.\nWe would buy the oil today.\nLord, prepare us, oh, get us ready!", "2 Not only my lamp, Lord, but my vessel too,\nRedeeming the time to be filled up with You.\nI'm going forth to meet You, my Bridegroom so dear.\nI know then at midnight You'll soon, Lord, appear.", "3 Lord, make us ready at any cost\nOr else at Your coming we'll suffer great loss.\nWe don't want to say, Lord, our lamp's going out.\nThen it is too late when we hear the great shout.", "4 As virgins we're loving and enjoying You,\nAlways responding, You're fresh and so new.\nOur spirits You're filling and soul saturating.\nOur lamps and our vessels we surrender to You."]
