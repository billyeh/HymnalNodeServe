["1 The love of God constrains me\nFrom the depths within my spirit \nAnd He fills me up to the brim.", "2 The love of God compels me\nFrom the depths within my spirit \nAnd He fills me up to the brim.", "3 Now I am satisfied!\nAnd it's God who lives in me,\nExpressing His divinity.", "4 For when I shout:\nAmen!\nPraise the Lord!\nHallelujah! \nThe love of God enters me."]
