["1 Where's the answer? There must be more for me.\nIs this all to life-an empty vanity?\nDay by day and year by year go by.\nAm I just a man, a man just born to die?", "chorus Where's the answer? Oh I'm so empty\nAnd plagued by this vanity.\nDeep inside me, My conscience tells me:\nI need another destiny.", "2 I convinced my friends that everything's alright,\nThat my life and future and everything's so bright.\nBut a sense inside me, my friends, I can't deny,\nWarning deep inside me that I was living a lie.", "chorus Where's the answer? Oh I'm so empty\nAnd plagued by this vanity.\nDeep inside me, My conscience tells me:\nI need another destiny.", "3 The world and its glitter left me anxious, dark, and bitter,\nAlways yearning, my friends, is there something better?\nAnd religion, my friends, is just a Sunday game-\nDead teachings and doctrines will leave you just the same.", "chorus Where's the answer? Oh I'm so empty\nAnd plagued by this vanity.\nDeep inside me, My conscience tells me:\nI need another destiny.", "4 Oh God, where are You? I need You desperately!\nOh God, who are You? Why don't You answer me?\nThe heavens declare You and the earth shows Your beauty.\nBut I'm a man. Oh God, I'm so empty!", "chorus Lord, have mercy! I'm crying for You!\nPlease hear! Are you really true?\nI'm dark and lonely. You're far, far from me.\nOh Lord, I need You desperately!", "5 One day a friend told me that Jesus is the Lord.\nTo my great surprise, it's written in the Word.\nThey asked me to believe You. Your name I once blasphemed.\nDear Lord, You saved me just by calling on Your name.", "chorus Oh, Lord Jesus, dear Son, so glorious,\nI'm cleansed and You entered into me.\nOh, Lord Jesus, Your name most precious!\nYour Person, dear Lord, I now possess."]
