["1 It is God's commandment and desire\nThat His people call on Him\nAnd it is the joyful way to drink\nFrom the fount of God's salvation.\nYes, this is a joyful way\nTo delight oneself in Him.\nGod becomes our enjoyment\nJust by calling on His precious name.", "chorus Calling Him is not a new practice\nIn the New Testament.\nIt began way back in Genesis,\nAnd throughout the Old Testament.\nEnosh, Job, and Abraham-\nAll these ones called on Him.\nMoses, Samuel, and David-\nAnd many others did the same.", "3 It is such a jubilant practice\nThat Joel prophesied.\nAnd this was fulfilled at Pentecost,\nSo Peter testified:\nAll who call upon the name\nOf the Lord shall be saved.\nAll who call upon the name\nOf the Lord Jesus shall be saved.", "4 God outpoured His Spirit on all flesh\nFor the application\nOf His rich salvation to all men,\nBut we must call upon Him.\nCalling brings the Jubilee;\nJesus comes to you and me.\nCalling sets the captives free;\nWe're enjoying God in liberty.", "5 Calling was a major practice then\nBy the early Christians.\nIt became a popular sign\nOf Christ's believers then.\nYes, this is a joyful way\nTo delight oneself in Him.\nGod becomes enjoyable\nJust by calling on His precious name.", "6 Calling is opposed as it was then\nBy the camp of religion.\nBut His witnesses kept calling Him:\nThey weren't stopped by opposition.\nWe must be like Stephen then;\nJesus was his everything.\nEven while they martyred him,\nHe was calling on the highest name."]
