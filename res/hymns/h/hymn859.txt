["1 Let party names no more\nThe Christian world o'erspread;\nGentile and Jew, and bond and free,\nAre one in Christ, their Head.", "2 Among the saints on earth\nLet mutual love be found;\nHeirs of the same inheritance,\nWith mutual blessings crowned.", "3 Let envy, child of hell!\nBe banished far away:\nThose in sweet fellowship should dwell,\nWho the same Lord obey.", "4 Thus will the Church below\nGod's purpose ever prove;\nWhere streams of endless pleasure flow,\nAnd every heart is love."]
