["1 With praise and thanksgiving\nThere stands a great throng\nIn the presence of Jesus\nAnd sing this new song.", "chorus Unto Him Who hath loved us\nAnd washed us from sin,\nUnto Him be the glory forever!\nAmen!", "2 All these once were sinners,\nDefiled in His sight,\nNow arrayed in pure garments,\nIn praise they unite.", "3 He maketh the rebel\nA priest and a king,\nHe hath bought us, and taught us\nThis new song to sing.", "4 How helpless and hopeless\nWe sinners had been,\nIf He never had loved us till\nCleansed from our sin.", "5 Aloud in His praises\nOur voices shall ring,\nSo that others, believing,\nThis new song shall sing."]
