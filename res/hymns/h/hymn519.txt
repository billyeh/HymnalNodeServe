["1 My heart is fixed, eternal God,\nFixed on Thee, fixed on Thee;\nAnd my immortal choice is made,\nChrist for me, Christ for me;\nHe is my prophet, priest, and king,\nWho did for me salvation bring,\nAnd while I've breath I mean to sing,\nChrist for me, Christ for me.", "2 In Him I see the Godhead shine,\nChrist for me, Christ for me;\nHe is the majesty divine,\nChrist for me, Christ for me;\nThe Father's well-beloved Son,\nCo-partner of His royal throne,\nWho bore the guilt of man alone,\nChrist for me, Christ for me.", "3 Let others boast of heaps of gold,\nChrist for me, Christ for me;\nHis riches never can be told,\nChrist for me, Christ for me;\nYour gold will waste and wear away,\nYour honors perish in a day;\nMy portion never can decay,\nChrist for me, Christ for me.", "4 In pining sickness, or in health,\nChrist for me, Christ for me;\nIn deepest poverty or wealth,\nChrist for me, Christ for me;\nAnd in that all-important day,\nWhen I the summons must obey,\nAnd pass from this dark world away,\nChrist for me, Christ for me."]
