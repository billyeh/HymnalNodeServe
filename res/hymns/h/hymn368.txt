["1 More love to Thee, O Lord,\nMore love to Thee!\nHear Thou the prayer I make\nOn bended knee;\nThis is my earnest plea:\nMore love, O Lord, to Thee,\nMore love to Thee,\nMore love to Thee!", "2 Once earthly joy I craved,\nSought peace and rest;\nNow Thee alone I seek,\nGive what is best;\nThis all my prayer shall be:\nMore love, O Lord, to Thee,\nMore love to Thee,\nMore love to Thee!", "3 Let sorrow do its work,\nSend grief and pain;\nSweet are Thy messengers,\nSweet their refrain,\nWhen they can sing with me,\nMore love, O Lord, to Thee,\nMore love to Thee,\nMore love to Thee!", "4 Then shall my latest breath\nWhisper Thy praise;\nThis be the parting cry\nMy heart shall raise;\nThis still its prayer shall be:\nMore love, O Lord, to Thee,\nMore love to Thee,\nMore love to Thee!"]
