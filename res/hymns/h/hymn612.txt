["1 God intends that all His being,\nBe my full supply;\nWith Him I must be united\nIn spirit nigh.", "chorus All God's being, all His riches,\nIn the Spirit flow;\nI must exercise my spirit,\nHim to know.", "2 All the riches of His nature,\nHe has given me;\nI must touch Him in the spirit\nThese to see.", "3 With the mind we understand Him\nWith the spirit touch;\nThose who never use the spirit,\nLack very much.", "4 When to messages I listen\nI must pray them in;\nThus the word will be digested,\nFrom within.", "5 When the Word of God I study\nI must touch the Lord;\nIf in mind and not in spirit\nDead is the Word.", "6 O what riches, O what glory,\nIn the Spirit shine!\nWhen I exercise my spirit\nAll are mine."]
