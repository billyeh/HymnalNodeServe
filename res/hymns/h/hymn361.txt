["1 O Love divine, by Christ revealed,\nIncarnate Love that died for me,\nTo Thee myself I gladly yield,\nI consecrate my all to Thee.", "2 O Light divine, by Christ displayed,\nSource of all light, who flesh became,\nShed Thy bright beams upon my head,\nBurn in my heart a constant flame.", "3 O Truth divine, by Christ made known,\nAll truth must Thy reflection be;\nWithin my heart set up Thy throne,\nAnd in Thy freedom make me free.", "4 O Cross divine, by Christ endured,\nThou cross on which He groaned and died,\nAnd man's redemption thus secured,\nIn Thy blest shadow let me hide.", "5 O Peace divine, by Christ bestowed,\nThy heavenly dove to earth come down,\nMay He within make His abode,\nMy life with His dear presence crown.", "6 O Joy divine, by Christ possessed,\nFor which He did the cross endure,\nFill with Thyself and make me blest,\nContented, restful and secure."]
