["1 The Lord is my Shepherd forever,\nHe maketh me down to lie,\nHe leads me beside the still waters\nO how He does satisfy!", "chorus Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me\nAll the days, all the days of my life;\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me\nAll the days, all the days of my life.\nAnd I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,\nAnd I shall feast at the table spread for me;\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me\nAll the days, all the days of my life.", "2 My Shepherd Himself is my pasture,\nMy Shepherd, the waters of rest;\nI eat of His riches in spirit,\nI drink, and O how I am blest!", "3 My Shepherd my soul is restoring,\nMy will, and emotion, and mind;\nAnd though through the valley I'm walking,\nO what a Companion I find!", "4 A table prepared by my Shepherd\nI feast on and Satan destroy;\nMy head is anointed with oil,\nMy cup runneth over with joy!", "5 And now in His house I am dwelling\nEnjoying the goodness of God;\nMy pleasure is far beyond telling,\nMy pleasure is Jesus my Lord!"]
