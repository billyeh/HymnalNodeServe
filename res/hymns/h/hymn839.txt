["1 Lord, Thou art a potter skilled,\nAnd a glorious builder too\nMolding for Thy vessel great\nBuilding with Thy house in view.\nI am both a man of clay,\nAnd a new-made living stone\nThat Thy vessel I may be,\nAnd the temple Thou wouldst own.", "2 Though of clay Thou madest us\nThou wouldst have us be transformed;\nWith Thy life as purest gold\nUnto precious stones conformed.\nWe shall, through Thy building work\nThen become Thy loving Bride\nIn one Body joined to Thee\nThat Thy heart be satisfied.", "3 What Thy heart desires and loves,\nAre not precious stones alone\nBut together these to build,\nFor Thy glory, for Thy home.\nThou, the all-inclusive Christ\nDost a builded Church require\nThat Thy glorious riches may,\nRadiate their light entire.", "4 Not the person spiritual,\nIn an individual way\nBut the corporate life expressed,\nWill Thy heart's desire display.\nMembers separate and detached,\nNe'er express Thee perfectly\nBut Thy Body tempered, built\nEver shall Thy fulness be.", "5 Build me, Lord, with other saints\nIndependence ne'er allow\nBut according to Thy plan,\nFitly frame and join me now.\nIn experience not my boast\nNor in gifts would be my pride;\nFor Thy building I give all\nThat Thou may be glorified."]
