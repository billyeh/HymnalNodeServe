["1 We're in the land, we're in the land!\nO Hallelujah! In the land!\nChrist is the land, Christ is the land,\nO praise the Lord, He is the land!", "chorus He is the milk and honey, too;\nThe grain, the oil, the wine so new.\nWe're in the land! We're in the land!\nO Hallelujah! In the land!", "2 This land includes so many things:\nWheat, barley, vines, deep-flowing springs,\nFig trees and never-failing bread-\nO what a land before us spread!", "chorus To have the produce and abound\nWe daily labor on the ground;\nThen to the meetings we will bring\nThe topmost Christ, our offering!"]
