["1 Strong are the walls around me,\nThat hold me all the day;\nBut they who thus have bound me,\nCannot keep God away:\nMy very dungeon walls are dear,\nBecause the God I love is here.", "2 They know, who thus oppress me,\n'Tis hard to be alone;\nBut know not One can bless me,\nWho comes through bars and stone;\nHe makes my dungeon's darkness bright,\nAnd fills my bosom with delight.", "3 Thy love, O God, restores me\nFrom sighs and tears to praise;\nAnd deep my soul adores Thee,\nNor thinks of time or place:\nI ask no more, in good or ill,\nBut union with Thy holy will.", "4 'Tis that which makes my treasure,\n'Tis that which brings my gain;\nConverting woe to pleasure,\nAnd reaping joy from pain.\nOh, 'tis enough, whate'er befall,\nTo know that God is All in all."]
