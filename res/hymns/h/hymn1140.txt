["1 Our old man has been crucified with Christ;\nYes, all we are in oldness He sufficed\nTo bring to naught upon the cross that He\nHimself as our new Husband fully be\nEnjoyed by us.", "2 Yes, all our strength of independence died,\nFor we with Christ were fully crucified.\nNow we're so glad to be His proper wife,\nDependently enjoying Him as life\nForevermore.", "3 Our dying was not such a sad affair,\nThe new man was rejoicing to be there;\nThe old man dead and buried, we were free\nTo marry Christ, and live eternally,\nHis wife, fore'er.", "4 Now as the new, regenerated man,\nWe do two things, according to God's plan:\nBear fruit to God and serve in spirit new\nSo God becomes the fruit of all we do,\nAnd all we are.", "5 There are three laws in Romans seven, see-\nThe law of God; the mind, the good old me;\nThe sinful law indwelling bodily;\nYet from these all the Lord has set us free,\nTo live by Him.", "6 In Romans eight the law of Spirit is,\nWhere we're in Christ, and we are fully His,\nThe law of life has set us wholly free\nAnd Christ becomes our life eternally,\nHallelujah!"]
