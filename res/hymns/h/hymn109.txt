["1 The veil is rent! Lo! Jesus stands\nBefore the throne of grace;\nAnd clouds of incense from His hands\nFill all that glorious place.", "2 His precious blood is sprinkled there,\nBefore and on the throne;\nAnd His own wounds in heav'n declare\nHis work on earth is done.", "3 'Tis finished!\" on the cross He said,\nIn agonies and blood;\n'Tis finished: \"now He lives to plead\nBefore the face of God.", "4 'Tis finished!\" Here our souls can rest,\nHis work can never fail;\nBy Him, our Sacrifice and Priest\nWe enter through the veil."]
