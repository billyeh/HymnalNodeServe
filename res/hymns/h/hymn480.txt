["1 Joined unto Christ the Conqueror,\nHis Calv'ry triumph, too,\nAssures me in the darkest hour\nThat He will take me through.", "2 Joined unto Christ the risen Lord,\nTriumphant now above;\nThe glory of His cross reveals\nMagnificence of love.", "3 Joined unto Christ's full victory,\nMagnificently free;\nDeclare it in the conquering name,\nAnd powers of darkness flee.", "4 Joined unto Christ! Magnificent!\nHis wondrous Calvary plan,\nDraws us through ages to adore;\nFor \"Worthy is the Lamb.\""]
