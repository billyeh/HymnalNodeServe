["1 Our hearts are full of Christ and long\nTheir glorious matter to declare!\nOf Him we make our loftier song,\nWe cannot from His praise forbear:\nOur ready tongues make haste to sing\nThe glories of the heav'nly King.", "2 Fairer than all the earthborn race,\nPerfect in comeliness Thou art;\nReplenished are Thy lips with grace,\nAnd full of love Thy tender heart.\nGod ever-blest! we bow the knee,\nAnd own all fulness dwells in Thee."]
