["1 I am not skilled to understand\nWhat God hath willed, what God hath planned;\nI only know at His right hand\nStands One who is my Savior.", "2 I take Him at His word indeed:\n\"Christ died for sinners\"-this I read;\nFor in my heart I find a need\nOf Him to be my Savior!", "3 That He should leave His place on high\nAnd come for sinful man to die,\nYou count it strange? So once did I\nBefore I knew my Savior!", "4 And, oh, that He fulfilled may see\nThe travail of His soul in me,\nAnd with His work contented be,\nAs I with my dear Savior!", "5 Yes, living, dying, let me bring\nMy strength, my solace from this spring-\nThat He who lives to be my King\nOnce died to be my Savior!"]
