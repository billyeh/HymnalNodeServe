["1 O Lamb of God, still keep me\nClose to Thy wounded side;\n'Tis only there in safety\nAnd peace I can abide.", "2 What foes and snares surround me,\nWhat lusts and fears within;\nThe grace that sought and found me\nAlone can keep me clean.", "3 'Tis only in Thee hiding\nI feel myself secure;\nOnly in Thee abiding,\nThe conflict can endure;", "4 Thine arm the victory gaineth\nO'er every hateful foe;\nThy love my heart sustaineth\nIn all its care and woe.", "5 Soon shall my eyes behold Thee,\nWith rapture face to face;\nOne half hath not been told me\nOf all Thy power and grace;", "6 Thy beauty, Lord, and glory,\nThe wonders of Thy love,\nShall be the endless story\nOf all Thy saints above."]
