["1 Oh, Lord, grant us revelation,\nGrant us light and sight to see\nThat as life, within our spirit,\nThou art our reality;\nAnd that from within our spirit,\nNow You must possess each part\nSpreading out to all our being,\nMaking home in all our heart.", "2 It is not the outward action-\nPure behavior, conduct good,\nProper poise and perfect manners,\nDoing what we think we should;\nBut it's Christ, a living Person,\nMingled thus with us within,\nSpreading into all our being,\nSo that we might live by Him.", "3 Oh, Lord, let our every action,\nEverything we do and say,\nCome from Thee alone, experienced\nIn a real and inner way.\nWe reject the empty teachings,\nLeave the methods and the strife.\nLet our only way of living\nBe the overflow of life!", "4 Following the inner feeling,\nLiving in the overflow,\nMoving in the rich anointing,\nNot by what we think or know,\nNothing through intent or motive,\nOr with purpose duly done,\nBut just following this feeling,\nLiving by the living One!", "5 Thus we're sanctified completely,\nSaturated thoroughly;\nNot the old religious concept:\nSeparated doctrinally.\nBut 'tis Christ Himself within us,\nAdded to our every part,\nAll supplying, satisfying,\nMaking home in all our heart."]
