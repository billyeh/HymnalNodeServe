["1 Speak, Lord, in the stillness,\nWhile I wait on Thee;\nHushed my heart to listen,\nIn expectancy.", "2 Speak, O blessed Master,\nIn this quiet hour;\nLet me see Thy face, Lord,\nFeel Thy touch of power.", "3 For the words Thou speakest,\nThey are life indeed;\nLiving bread from heaven,\nNow my spirit feed!", "4 All to Thee is yielded,\nI am not my own;\nBlissful, glad surrender,\nI am Thine alone.", "5 Speak, Thy servant heareth,\nBe not silent, Lord;\nWaits my soul upon Thee\nFor the quickening word.", "6 Fill me with the knowledge\nOf Thy glorious will;\nAll Thine own good pleasure\nIn Thy child fulfill.", "7 Like a watered garden,\nFull of fragrance rare,\nLingering in Thy presence,\nLet my life appear."]
