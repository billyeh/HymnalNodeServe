["1 Chapter one of Genesis:\nLife is God's one emphasis,\nShowing Christ subjectively,\nStep by step He grows in me.", "2 Just as earth became a waste,\nDeath and darkness once I faced.\nGod had judged, no light did shine;\nHollowness and void were mine.", "3 Satan's fall had filled the seas\nWith corruption, sin, disease.\nYet the Spirit brooded o'er\nThe abyss: \"chaos no more!", "4 God then spoke: \"the air was cleared!\nDarkness which I once had feared\nWas dispelled by God's own light.\nA new day! No longer night!", "5 As the light began to shine\nHis discernment became mine.\nI began to see aright;\nGod divided dark from light.", "6 Then the waters He did split;\nAn expanse between them fit,\nEarthly things from heavenly,\nSeparated hence they'd be.", "7 On the third day God designed\nThat the waters be confined.\nIn our lives dry land must be;\nNo more death and no more sea!", "8 God commands: \"death's water halt!\nChrist, the good land, we exalt!\nSeparated from all strife\nWe enjoy Christ as our life.", "9 Growing in us inwardly;\nGrass, then herb, then fruitful tree.\nWe begin as but a blade;\nSoon our being He'll pervade.", "10 Then the fourth day lights He set;\nBearers these, more definite.\nRicher light to radiate,\nHigher life to generate.", "11 Sun, the greater light we see\nRuling day triumphantly;\nYet when darkness fills the skies,\nWaxing moon is on the rise!", "12 'Tis the Church she typifies;\nFor her light on Christ relies.\nIn His image meant to be,\nShe reflects Christ perfectly.", "13 Lastly, precious stars He placed,\nStrong in spirit, full of grace;\nShining when the moon seems faint,\nThese are overcoming saints.", "14 What a glorious picture here:\nSun and moon and stars appear!\nLord, our prayer is that we'd be\nFull of light and life in Thee."]
