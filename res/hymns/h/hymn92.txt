["1 O dearest Lord, what law hast Thou e'er broken\nThat such sharp sentence should on Thee be spoken?\nOf what misdeed hast Thou to make confession-\nWhat dark transgression?", "2 They crown Thy head with thorns, they smite,\nthey scourge Thee;\nWith cruel mockings to the cross they urge Thee;\nThey give Thee gall to drink, they still decry Thee;\nThey crucify Thee.", "3 What punishment so strange is suffered yonder?\nThe shepherd dies for sheep that loved to wander;\nThe Master pays the debt His servants owe Him,\nWho would not know Him.", "4 The sinless Son of God must die in sadness;\nThe sinful child of man may live in gladness;\nMan forfeited His life and is acquitted-\nGod is committed.", "5 O mighty King, no time can dim Thy glory!\nHow shall I spread abroad Thy wondrous story?\nHow shall I find some worthy gift to proffer?\nWhat dare I offer?", "6 I'll think upon Thy mercy without ceasing;\nThat earth's vain joys no more to me be pleasing;\nTo do Thy will shall be my sole endeavor\nHenceforth forever."]
