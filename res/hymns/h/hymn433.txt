["1 I am the Lord's! O joy beyond expression,\nO sweet response to voice of love Divine;\nFaith's joyous \"Yes\" to the assuring whisper,\n\"Fear not! I have redeemed thee; thou art Mine.\"", "2 I am the Lord's! It is the glad confession\nWherewith the Bride recalls the happy day,\nWhen love's \"I will\" accepted Him forever,\n\"The Lord's,\" to love, to honor and obey.", "3 I am the Lord's! Yet teach me all it meaneth,\nAll it involves of love and loyalty,\nOf holy service, absolute surrender,\nAnd unreserved obedience unto Thee.", "4 I am the Lord's! Yes; body, soul, and spirit,\nO seal them irrecoverably Thine;\nAs Thou, Beloved, in Thy grace and fulness\nForever and forevermore art mine."]
