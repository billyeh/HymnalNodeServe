["1 There's a little word that the Lord has giv'n\nFor our help in the hour of need:\nLet us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin,\nTo be dead and dead indeed.", "chorus Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,\nLet us reckon, rather than feel;\nLet us be true to the reck'ning,\nAnd He will make it real.", "2 There's another word that the Lord has giv'n,\nIn the very same verse we read,\nLet us reckon ourselves as alive in Him,\nAs alive and alive indeed.", "3 While we trust in feeling or inward frames\nWe shall always be tossed about,\nLet us anchor fast to the Word of God,\nAnd reckon away our doubt.", "4 As the mariner, when the skies are dim.\nSails on by his compass true;\nSo our faith would cling to the promise firm.\nAnd reckon the journey through.", "5 O how sweet it is to be anchored fast\nTo a hope that can never fail;\nLet us reckon on with a firmer trust,\nTill we anchor within the veil.", "6 You may claim the promise from every pain,\nYou may know His power to heal;\nBut your faith must rest in His word alone,\nAnd reckon, rather than feel."]
