["1 Sometimes a light surprises\nThe Christian while he sings;\nIt is the Lord who rises\nWith healing in His wings;\nWhen comforts are declining,\nHe grants the soul again\nA season of clear shining,\nTo cheer it after rain.", "2 In holy contemplation\nWe sweetly then pursue\nThe theme of God's salvation,\nAnd find it ever new;\nSet free from present sorrow,\nWe cheerfully can say-\nE'en let the unknown morrow\nBring with it what it may.", "3 It can bring with it nothing,\nBut He will bear us through;\nWho gives the lilies clothing,\nWill clothe His people too:\nBeneath the spreading heavens\nNo creature but is fed;\nAnd He, who feeds the ravens,\nWill give His children bread.", "4 Though vine nor fig tree neither\nTheir wonted fruit shall bear;\nThough all the fields should wither\nNor flocks nor herds be there;\nYet God the same abiding,\nHis praise shall tune my voice,\nFor, while in Him confiding,\nI cannot but rejoice."]
