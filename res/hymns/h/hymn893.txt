["1 Conflict today is fierce\nThe strength of Satan more;\nThe cry of battle calling now,\nIs louder than before.\nThe rebel voice of hell,\nE'en stronger now becomes;\nBut list, the midnight cry resounds\nBehold, I quickly come!", "2 Trials more bitter grow\nThe fighting doth enlarge;\nHell's forces rally all their pow'rs,\nAnd gather for the charge.\nYet while we wait and watch,\nAnd feel the war severe\nWe hear the joyful song ring out\nJesus, the Lord. is near!", "3 'Tis harder at the end,\nThe word to testify\nFor Satan fights with all his pow'r,\nOur witness to defy.\nMuch greater strength we need,\nThe foe to overcome;\nHow happy when the Lord we see,\nAnd all our sighing's done!", "4 Who then will forward go,\nStrong in His mighty power?\nWho then will firmly trust the Lord,\nUntil the vict'ry hour;\nTill with the conqu'rors blest\nThe triumph song's begun?\nThat man will then rejoice to hear\nBehold, I quickly come!", "5 Who then will choose God's best\nAnd take the narrow track\nThough passing thru the wildest storms\nYet never turning back?\nWho now will dare press on\nEnduring pain and fear?\nAll such will then rejoice to see,\nJesus, the Lord, is near!", "6 Though deep the darkness be,\nWe still would onward go\nTill we the day of rapture greet,\nAnd glory 'round shall glow.\n'Tis there we'll see the Lord\nAnd Satan overcome;\nThe overcomers will rejoice\nJesus, the Lord. has come!"]
