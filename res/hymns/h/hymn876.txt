["1 When war is hot and fierce\nAnd Satan strong\nThen firmly trust God's Word,\nAnd sing faith's song.", "2 You need to shout but once\nAnd you will win;\nOh, do not shut your mouth,\nAnd lose therein.", "3 If pressed your spirit is,\nAnd powerless\nPray thru the precious blood\nVictorious.", "4 The foe though fierce, you can,\nStill fight with him;\nIf you will keep your stand\nYou soon will win.", "5 Therefore you must declare,\nChrist's victory;\nThe situation dark,\nSoon changed will be."]
