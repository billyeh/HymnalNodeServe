["1 Jesus the kingdom has come into us,\nReigning and shining He's all glorious,\nChrist as the seed is the King who has come,\nInto our spirit His kingdom He's sown.", "chorus O let Him grow, O let Him grow;\nHis kingdom life be all we know.\nJesus, the kingdom is sown into us;\nJesus, the kingdom, O how glorious!", "2 We must repent for the kingdom's at hand;\nAll that we do, think, or feel, or have planned\nMust be abandoned and changed in our mind;\nLeave all the world and self-seeking behind.", "3 All of religion has missed it again,\nTeaching for doctrines the concepts of men;\nThey vainly wait for the kingdom to be.\nA dispensation they're hoping to see.", "4 But now the kingdom to us has been shown,\nIt is no less than our Jesus alone.\nIt is the Person of Christ in us all,\nAnd it begins as a seed when we call."]
