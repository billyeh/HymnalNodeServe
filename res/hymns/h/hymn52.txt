["1 Father, to Thee a joyful song we raise\nWith all Thine own;\nAnd in Thy presence sound a note of praise\nTo Thee alone;\nBro’t nigh, bro’t home to Thee—O wondrous grace,\nThat gives us now with Thine own Son our place.", "2 How deep the holy joy that fills that scene,\nWhere love is known!\nThy love, our God and Father, now is seen,\nIn Him alone;\nAs, in the holy calm of Thine own rest,\nHe leads the praise of those Thy love has blessed.", "3 He leads the praise! How precious to Thine ear\n   The song He sings!\nHow precious, too, to Thee—how near, how dear\nAre those He brings\nTo share His place: ’twas thus that Thou didst plan;\nThou lovedst Him before the world began."]
