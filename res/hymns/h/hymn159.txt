["1 Give me a sight, O Savior,\nOf Thy wondrous love to me,\nOf the love that brought Thee down to earth,\nTo die on Calvary.", "chorus Oh, make me understand it,\nHelp me to take it in,\nWhat it meant to Thee, the Holy One,\nTo bear away my sin.", "2 Was it the nails, O Savior,\nThat bound Thee to the tree?\nNay, 'twas Thine everlasting love,\nThy love for me, for me.", "3 Oh, wonder of all wonders,\nThat through Thy death for me,\nMy open sins, my secret sins,\nCan all forgiven be.", "4 Then melt my heart, O Savior,\nBend me, yea, break me down,\nUntil I own Thee Conqueror,\nAnd Lord and Sov'reign crown."]
