["1 Lord, we've heard the call, \"Come forward,\"\nUnto the most Holy Place,\nTo behold shekinah glory\nShining from Your blessed face.", "chorus Coming forward to the Holiest,\nThrough the incense altar's prayer;\nNo more veil of separation,\nWe may boldly enter there.", "2 We come forward by a new way,\nFreshly cut and freshly slain,\nTo the Holiest of Holies;\nGlorious access we obtain.", "3 We come forward unto our God,\nWho is sitting on the throne;\nHe has paved the way to glory\nBy His blood and cross alone.", "4 We come forward to the new age,\nWith assured heart, true and bold.\nTo enjoy th' eternal purpose,\nNe'er to shrink back to the old.", "5 Praise You, Lord, we've all come forward.\nNow within the Holiest,\nYou're our God and we're Your people;\nHere we dwell forever blest."]
