["1 God sent His mighty pow'r\nTo this poor, sinful heart,\nTo keep me every hour,\nAnd needful grace impart;\nAnd since His Spirit came,\nTo take supreme control,\nThe love-enkindled flame\nIs burning in my soul.", "chorus 'Tis burning in my soul,\n'Tis burning in my soul;\nThe fire of heav'nly love is\nburning in my soul;\nThe Holy Spirit came,\nAll glory to His name!\nThe fire of heav'nly love is\nburning in my soul.", "2 Before the cross I bow,\nUpon the altar lay\nA willing off'ring now,\nMy all from day to day.\nMy Savior paid the price,\nMy name He sweetly calls;\nUpon the sacrifice\nThe fire from heaven falls.", "3 No good that I have done,\nHis promise I embrace;\nAccepted in the Son,\nHe saves me by His grace.\nAll glory be to God!\nLet hallelujahs roll;\nHis love is shed abroad,\nThe fire is in my soul."]
