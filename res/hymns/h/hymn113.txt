["1 How pleasant is the sound of praise!\nIt well becomes the saints of God;\nShould we refuse our songs to raise,\nThe stones might tell our shame abroad.", "2 For Him Who washed us in His blood,\nLet us our sweetest songs prepare;\nHe sought us wandering far from God,\nAnd now preserves us by His care.", "3 One string there is of sweetest tone,\nReserved for sinners saved by grace;\n'Tis sacred to one class alone\nAnd touched by one peculiar race.", "4 Though angels may with rapture see\nHow mercy flows in Jesus' blood,\nIt is not theirs to prove, as we,\nThe cleansing virtue of this flood.", "5 Though angels praise the heavenly King,\nAnd worship Him as God alone,\nWe can with exultation sing,\n\"He wears our nature on the throne.\"", "6 Lord, we adore Thy wondrous love,\nWhich brought Thee here to bleed and die\nThat Thou lost sinners may restore\nAnd to the Father bring them nigh."]
