["1 O Lord, Thy being is of old\nBefore th' eternal past began!\nFor Thou th' eternal Father art\nThe uncreated, great I AM!", "2 Although a man with men become\nYet Thou with God eternal art!\nThe same completeness Thou dost share\nAnd infinite as God Thou art!", "3 Thine origin, the same as God\nBefore creation was decreed!\nBefore the foremost, Thou art first\nNone other doth Thyself precede!", "4 Thou never changest thru all time\nThy years are to eternity!\nNone is as lasting as Thyself\nNor is there any after Thee!", "5 Just as the Father, diff'ring not\nThe same perfection Thou too hast!\nThou art the Alpha and the First\nThou art Omega and the Last!", "6 We praise Thee for Thine endless years\nExtol Thee for Thy perfectness!\nAdmiring all Thy fulness vast\nWe marvel at Thy boundlessness!"]
