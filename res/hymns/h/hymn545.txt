["1 When this passing world is done,\nWhen has sunk yon glaring sun,\nWhen we stand with Christ on high,\nLooking o'er life's history;\nThen, Lord, shall I fully know,\nNot till then, how much I owe.", "2 When I stand before the throne\nDressed in beauty not my own,\nWhen I see Thee as Thou art,\nLove Thee with unsinning heart;\nThen, Lord, shall I fully know,\nNot till then, how much I owe.", "3 E'en on earth, as through a glass\nDarkly, let Thy glory pass;\nMake forgiveness feel so sweet;\nMake Thy Spirit's help so meet:\nE'en on earth, Lord, make me know\nSomething of how much I owe."]
