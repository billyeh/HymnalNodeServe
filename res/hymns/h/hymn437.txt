["1 Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?\nIs not thine a captured heart?\nChief among ten thousand own Him;\nJoyful choose the better part.", "chorus Captivated by His beauty,\nWorthy tribute haste to bring;\nLet His peerless worth constrain thee,\nCrown Him now unrivaled King.", "2 Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,\nLovely things of time and sense;\nGilded thus does sin disarm thee,\nHoneyed lest thou turn thee thence.", "3 What has stripped the seeming beauty\nFrom the idols of the earth?\nNot a sense of right or duty,\nBut the sight of peerless worth.", "4 Not the crushing of those idols,\nWith its bitter void and smart;\nBut the beaming of His beauty,\nThe unveiling of His heart.", "5 Who extinguishes their taper\nTill they hail the rising sun?\nWho discards the garb of winter\nTill the summer has begun?", "6 'Tis that look that melted Peter,\n'Tis that face that Stephen saw,\n'Tis that heart that wept with Mary,\nCan alone from idols draw:", "7 Draw and win and fill completely,\nTill the cup o'erflow the brim;\nWhat have we to do with idols\nWho have companied with Him?"]
