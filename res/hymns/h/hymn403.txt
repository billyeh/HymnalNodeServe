["1 Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,\nFor my very life art Thou;\nThee I take to all my problems\nAs the full solution now.\nLive Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,\nIn all things Thy will be done;\nI but a transparent vessel\nTo make visible the Son.", "2 Consecrated is Thy temple,\nPurged from every stain and sin;\nMay Thy flame of glory now be\nManifested from within.\nLet the earth in solemn wonder\nSee my body willingly\nOffered as Thy slave obedient,\nEnergized alone by Thee.", "3 Every moment, every member,\nGirded, waiting Thy command;\nUnderneath the yoke to labor\nOr be laid aside as planned.\nWhen restricted in pursuing,\nNo disquiet will beset;\nUnderneath Thy faithful dealing\nNot a murmur or regret.", "4 Ever tender, quiet, restful,\nInclinations put away,\nThat Thou may for me choose freely\nAs Thy finger points the way.\nLive Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,\nFor my very life art Thou;\nThee I take to all my problems\nAs the full solution now."]
