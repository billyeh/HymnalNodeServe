["1 As pants the hart for cooling streams\nWhen heated in the chase,\nSo longs my soul, O God, for Thee,\nAnd Thy refreshing grace.", "2 Why restless, why cast down, my soul?\nTrust God, who will employ\nHis aid for thee, and change these sighs\nTo thankful hymns of joy.", "3 For Thee, my God, the living God,\nMy thirsty soul doth pine;\nOh, when shall I behold Thy face,\nThou Majesty Divine?", "4 God of my strength, how long shall I,\nLike one forgotten, mourn,\nForlorn, forsaken, and exposed\nTo my oppressor's scorn?", "5 Why restless, why cast down, my soul?\nHope still, and thou shalt sing\nThe praise of Him who is thy God,\nThy health's eternal spring."]
