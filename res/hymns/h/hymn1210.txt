["1 Through God's word, my hope at His returning\nIs that all my being be redeemed;\nYet in times of grief and tribulation,\nDoubt and fear arise, no hope is seen.\nIn those hours, when prayer cannot be uttered,\nOnly groaning from my breast is heard.\nThen the Spirit, in like manner, helps me,\nPraying in my weakness unto God.", "2 Lord, my prayer is not for deeper suffering,\nBut that from each trial I'd be free.\nLet the cup of bitterness be taken;\nYet, Thy will, not mine, dear Lord, must be.\nEven now, though trials sore surround me,\nStill within my heart there is a peace,\nFor the love of God outpoured within me\nFloods my heart and bids my doubting cease.", "3 Blest assurance! God has fully ordered\nEvery matter by His sovereign hand;\nEvery person (though we see so dimly),\nEvery thing's according to His plan.\nEvery trial is but the Father's answer\nTo the groaning of the Spirit's prayer;\nMay He gain in every tribulation,\nUntil we Christ's glory fully share.", "4 How could God from all His dealings spare us,\nAfter He spared not His only Son?\nCould the Potter's hand upon the vessel\nEver leave the shaping work undone?\nFor the center of God's heart's desire\nIs that many brethren we will be\nUnto Christ, His precious First-begotten,\nAnd to Him, conformed we'll fully be.", "5 Heirs of God! Joint-heirs with our Lord Jesus!\nWhat a hope of glory this for us!\nThough the suff'rings presently seem grievous,\nGreater far the glory then for us!\nYea, in all these things we more than conquer,\nThrough the One whose love has us possessed;\nSoon the day for which waits all creation,\nWhen the sons of God are manifest!"]
