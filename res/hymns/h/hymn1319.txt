["1 That which for long the prophets sought,\nThe righteous yearned to see,\nHas in these last of days appeared\nIn its reality.", "chorus And we're now in the final stages,\n'Tis the completion of all the ages.\nAll those who believed the promise\nAre perfected now in us.", "2 Oh, blessed are our eyes that see,\nOur ears, how blessed to hear;\nThings angels ne'er could look into\nAre now to us made clear.", "3 Our sense is corporate, bold and strong,\nHis grace, how free to take;\nEncouraging the others on,\nRun for the kingdom's sake.", "4 We're weary not this race to run,\nIt makes our joy complete;\nFor this we know, around the bend,\nThe Lord we'll surely meet."]
