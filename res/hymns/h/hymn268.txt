["1 How I praise Thee, precious Savior,\nThat Thy love laid hold of me;\nThou hast saved and cleansed and filled me,\nThat I might Thy channel be.", "chorus Channels only, blessed Master,\nBut with all Thy wondrous grace,\nFlowing through us, Thou canst use us\nEvery hour in every place.", "2 Just a channel, full of blessing,\nTo the thirsty hearts around;\nTo tell out Thy full salvation,\nAll Thy loving message sound.", "3 Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me,\nA clean vessel in Thine hand;\nWith no strength but as Thou givest\nGraciously with each command.", "4 Witnessing Thy grace to save me,\nSetting free from self and sin;\nThou hast bought me to possess me,\nIn Thy fulness, Lord, come in.", "5 O Lord, fill now with Thy Spirit\nHearts that full surrender know;\nThat the streams of living water\nFrom our inner man may flow."]
