["1 The Lord is longing for His Bride,\nAll glorious within.\nHis heart will then be satisfied\nWhen she is fit for Him.", "2 'Tis by the Word the church is made\nHoly and pure as He;\nAll spots and wrinkles it removes\nThat she His Bride may be.", "3 We must redeem these golden days,\nEating the Word in prayer,\nAmening every line and phrase,\nAnd thus for Him prepare.", "4 Oh, how the Word doth penetrate,\nSpirit and soul divide,\nRevealing every hidden weight\nFor us to lay aside.", "5 Lord, how we thank Thee for Thy Word,\nLiving and operative.\nOh, for Thy coming, we are stirred\nEver by it to live!", "6 Lord, make us those who bring Thee back,\nWho satisfy Thy heart.\nNow by Thy Word supply our lack,\nMake us Thy counterpart."]
