["1 If I'd know Christ's risen power.\nI must ever love the Cross;\nLife from death alone arises;\nThere's no gain except by loss.", "chorus If no death, no life\nIf no death, no life;\nLife from death alone arises;\nIf no death, no life.", "2 If I'd have Christ formed within me\nI must breathe my final breath\nLive within the Cross's shadow\nPut my soul-life e'er to death.", "3 If God thru th' Eternal Spirit,\nNail me ever with the Lord;\nOnly then as death is working,\nWill His life thru me be poured."]
