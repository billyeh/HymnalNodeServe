["1 Take, drink this cup, His blood,\nRedemption of our God.\nThe peace which Christ has made,\nIs in this cup displayed.\nWe fellowship now with the Son:\nOn Calvary the work was done:\nThe way is clear, now all can come!", "2 Take, drink this cup, each one,\nHis death show till He come.\nEat, drink, display this feast:\nGod in the Lamb released!\nAround the table, sup and dine;\nWe eat the bread and drink the wine.\nAll blessing in this cup we find.", "3 No blood of cow or goat\nCould give us any hope.\nOur sins would all remain\nStill year by year the same.\nA God-man, sinless, He must find\nNo other offering of His kind,\nA spotless lamb for all mankind.", "4 Come! Now enjoy His blood.\nWhat access this to God!\nHere wondrous cleansing power\nFlows to us, hour by hour.\nOne sacrifice for all was made,\nAnd peace our conscience does pervade.\nRedemption's price is fully paid!", "5 Redeemer! Savior! King!\nOf Thy dear blood we sing,\nFor in it now we see\nThy mercy, boundless, free.\nThis cup, our portion blessed of God,\nIs of the cov'nant in Thy blood-\nDear, precious, precious, priceless blood!"]
