["1 O Christ, He is the fountain,\nThe deep, sweet well of life:\nIts living streams I've tasted\nWhich save from grief and strife.\nAnd to an ocean fulness,\nHis mercy doth expand;\nHis grace is all-sufficient\nAs by His wisdom planned.", "2 O I am my Beloved's,\nAnd my Beloved's mine;\nHe brings a poor vile sinner\nInto His house of wine!\nI stand upon His merit;\nI know no other stand.\nI'm hidden in His presence\nAnd held by His own hand.", "3 The Bride eyes not her garment,\nBut her dear Bridegroom's face;\nI will not gaze at glory,\nBut on my King of grace:\nNot at the crown He giveth,\nBut on His pierced hand;\nThe Lamb is all the glory,\nAnd my eternal stand!"]
