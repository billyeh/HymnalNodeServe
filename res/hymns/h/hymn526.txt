["1 Lord, Thou hast made Thyself to me\nA living, bright reality,\nMore present to faith's vision keen\nThan any earthly object seen;\nMore dear, more intimately nigh\nThan e'en the closest earthly tie.", "2 And Thou, blest vision of my soul,\nHast made my broken nature whole;\nHast purified my base desires,\nAnd kindled passion's holiest fires;\nMy nature Thou hast lifted up,\nAnd filled me with a glorious hope.", "3 Nearer and dearer still to me,\nThou living, loving Savior be;\nBrighter the vision of Thy face,\nMore charming still Thy words of grace;\nSo, life shall be transformed to love,\nThy grace and mercy more to prove."]
