["1 In that bright and golden moment when the\nChrist we love shall come,\nAnd the radiance of His glory we shall see;\nWhen the Bride shall meet the Bridegroom and\nHis loving wife become,\nWhat a meeting, what a meeting that will be!", "chorus What a meeting, what a meeting,\nWhat a meeting with our Lover, with\nour Bridegroom in the air!\nWhat a meeting, what a meeting,\nWhat a meeting any moment we will share!", "2 When to all who love His coming He shall speak\nthe word, \"Arise!\"\nOh, how blessed for that summons to be free!\nWith what rapture we shall greet Him as we\njoin Him in the skies-\nWhat a meeting, what a meeting that will be!", "3 Now in all the local churches we are meeting\nday by day\nAnd expecting any moment Christ to see,\nBut when Jesus comes the meeting starts that\nne'er will pass away-\nWhat a meeting, what a meeting that will be!", "4 Even now while we are meeting, Lord, we hope\nto see Thy face\nAnd forever without ceasing be with Thee.\nThen we'll just go right on meeting in another\nmeeting place-\nWhat a meeting, what a meeting this will be!"]
