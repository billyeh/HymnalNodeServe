["1 Not by wrestling, but by clinging\nShall we be most blest;\nWrestling only brings us sorrow;\nClinging brings us rest.", "2 When we stay our feeble efforts,\nAnd from struggling cease,\nUnconditional surrender\nBrings us God's own peace.", "3 Lean we all our weight on Jesus,\nWho alone can save;\nHe by might of love hath triumphed\nO'er His willing slave.", "4 Yielding, we shall know true conquest;\nDying, we shall live;\n\"Not my will, but Thine\" prevaileth,\nVictory to give."]
