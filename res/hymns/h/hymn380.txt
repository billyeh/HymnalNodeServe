["1 O Bread to pilgrims given,\nO Food for saints to eat,\nO Manna sent from heaven,\nFor heav'n-born natures meet;\nGive us, for Thee long pining,\nTo eat till richly filled;\nTill, earth's delights resigning,\nOur every wish is stilled.", "2 O Water, life bestowing,\nFrom out the Savior's heart,\nA fountain purely flowing,\nA fount of love Thou art.\nOh, let us, freely tasting,\nOur burning thirst assuage;\nThy sweetness, never wasting,\nAvails from age to age.", "3 Jesus, this feast receiving,\nWe Thee unseen adore;\nThy faithful word believing,\nWe take, and doubt no more.\nGive us, Thou true and loving,\nOn earth to live in-Thee;\nThen, God the veil removing,\nThy glorious face to see."]
