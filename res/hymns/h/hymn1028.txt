["1 Jesus is tenderly calling thee home-\nCalling today, calling today!\nWhy from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam,\nFarther and farther away?", "chorus Calling today! calling today!\nJesus is calling, is tenderly calling today!", "2 Jesus is calling the weary to rest,\nCalling today! calling today!\nBring Him thy burden and thou shalt be blest:\nHe will not turn thee away.", "3 Jesus is waiting, O come to Him now!\nWaiting today! waiting today!\nCome with thy sins, at His feet lowly bow;\nCome, and no longer delay.", "4 Jesus is pleading, O list to His voice!\nHear Him today! hear Him today!\nThey who believe on His name shall rejoice:\nQuickly arise, come away!"]
