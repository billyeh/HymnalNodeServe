["1 We will sing to the Lord with our spirit,\nWe will sing to the Lord from within,\nWe will sing hallelujah to Jesus;\nAnd be blent into oneness with Him.", "2 We have been many years in religion,\nWe have been many years in our mind,\nWe have been many years in emotions,\nAlways seeking, but never to find.", "3 Now we're learning to turn to our spirit,\nNow we're learning to take Christ as life;\nNow we're learning to feed upon Jesus\nAnd be freed from all struggling and strife.", "4 Hallelujah for life in the Spirit,\nHallelujah for newness within.\nWhen we turn from our mind to our spirit,\nWe enjoy all the riches of Him."]
