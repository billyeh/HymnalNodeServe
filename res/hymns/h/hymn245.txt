["1 Oh, spread the tidings 'round, wherever man is found,\nWherever human hearts and human woes abound;\nLet every Christian tongue proclaim the joyful sound:\nThe Comforter has come!", "chorus The Comforter has come,\nThe Comforter has come!\nThe Holy Ghost from heav'n,\nThe Lord's dear promise giv'n;\nOh, spread the tidings 'round,\nWherever man is found-\nThe Comforter has come!", "2 The long, long night is past, the morning breaks at last;\nAnd hushed the dreadful wail and fury of the blast,\nAs o'er the golden hills the day advances fast!\nThe Comforter has come!", "3 Lo, the great King of kings, with healing in His wings,\nTo every captive soul a full deliv'rance brings;\nAnd through the vacant cells the song of triumph rings:\nThe Comforter has come!", "4 O boundless love divine! how shall this tongue of mine\nTo wond'ring mortals tell the matchless grace divine-\nThat I, a child of hell, should in His image shine!\nThe Comforter has come!"]
