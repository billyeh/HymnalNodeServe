["1 I take my portion from Thy hand,\nAnd do not seek to understand;\nFor I am blind, while Thou dost see,\nThy will is mine, whate'er it be.", "chorus Whate'er it be! whate'er it be!\nI do not fear, whate'er it be!\nThy love divine sustaineth me;\nThy will is mine, whate'er it be.", "2 When darkness doth Thy face obscure,\nAnd many sorrows I endure,\nI think of Christ's Gethsemane;\nThy will is mine, whate'er it be.", "3 When tender joys to me are known,\nI render thanks to Thee alone;\nI know my cup is filled by Thee;\nThy will is mine, whate'er it be.", "4 Thus calmly do I face my lot,\nAccept it, Lord, and doubt Thee not;\nLo! all things work for good to me;\nThy will is mine, whate'er it be."]
