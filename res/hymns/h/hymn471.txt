["1 How can I ever stay away,\nAnd grieve Thy Spirit all the day,\nWhile Thou dost wait for me?\nI now am willing to return\nAnd wait no longer, for I yearn,\nHenceforth to follow Thee.", "2 I offer now without reserve,\nAll that I am and all I have,\nThy purpose to fulfill.\nOh, may the Lord accept and keep\nThat henceforth I may only seek,\nTo do the Father's will.", "3 When I look back, what grief and shame,\nThat I've brought none to trust Thy name\nThy word I've locked within.\nOh, may the Lord anointing give,\nAnd richly through my being live\nThat I may speak of Him.", "4 My gracious Lord has giv'n much grace\nExceeding e'en a friend my place;\nI fain would be His bride.\nI'd share His life and suffer loss\nAccepting willingly the cross\nWith Him identified."]
