["1 Our Lord, that One of peerless worth\nCame first to die to give new birth;\nHe comes again to have on earth\nA glorious Bride forever.", "chorus Jesus! Oh, You're coming soon,\nJesus! as our dear Bridegroom;\nJesus! may our hearts make room\nTo be Your Bride forever.", "2 What our dear Lord desires the most,\nIs not to just redeem the lost;\nBut that some saints would pay the cost,\nTo be His Bride forever.", "3 As virgins we must single be,\nNo other husband could have we,\nThat when He comes we'll then be free\nTo be His Bride forever.", "4 How could we love this fading world,\nWhen Christ desires that one great pearl;\nTo Him we must our love unfurl\nTo bring Him back forever."]
