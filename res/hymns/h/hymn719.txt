["1 Like a river, glorious\nIs God's perfect peace,\nOver all victorious\nIn its bright increase;\nPerfect, yet it floweth\nFuller every day,\nPerfect, yet it groweth\nDeeper all the way.", "chorus Stayed upon Christ Jesus,\nHearts are fully blest;\nFinding, as He promised,\nPerfect peace and rest.", "2 Hidden in the hollow\nOf His blessed hand,\nNever foe can follow,\nNever traitor stand;\nNot a surge of worry,\nNot a shade of care,\nNot a blast of hurry\nTouch the spirit there.", "3 Every joy or trial\nFalleth from above,\nTraced upon our dial\nBy the Sun of Love.\nWe may trust Him fully\nAll for us to do;\nThey who trust Him wholly\nFind Him wholly true."]
