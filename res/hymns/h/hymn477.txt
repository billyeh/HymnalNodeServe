["1 Though Christ a thousand times\nIn Bethlehem be born,\nIf He's not born in thee\nThy soul is still forlorn.\nThe Cross on Golgotha,\nWill never save thy soul;\nThe Cross in thine own heart,\nAlone can make thee whole.", "chorus O, Cross of Christ, I take thee\nInto this heart of mine,\nThat I to my own self may die\nAnd rise to thy life Divine.", "2 What e'er thou lovest, man,\nThat too become thou must;\nGod, if thou lovest God,\nDust, if thou lovest dust.\nGo out, God will come in;\nDie thou and let Him live;\nBe not and He will be;\nWait and He'll all things give.", "3 To bring thee to thy God,\nLove takes the shortest route;\nThe way which knowledge leads,\nIs but a roundabout.\nDrive out from thee the world,\nAnd then thy heart shall be\nFilled with the love of God,\nAnd holy like as He."]
