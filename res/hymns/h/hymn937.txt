["1 Lord, when by baptism we confess,\nOur oneness in Thy death\nOh, by Thy mercy and Thy grace\nMay Thou reveal its worth.", "2 By baptism in Thy death we're one,\nAnd buried too with Thee:\nThus we're forever dead to sin,\nAnd from its bondage free.", "3 By baptism in Thy death we're one,\nAnd buried too with Thee;\nThus to the world we bid farewell\nFrom Satan's slavery free.", "4 We're resurrected with Thee too\nFrom death's great pow'r set free;\nNow fruit of holiness we bear,\nIn our new life with Thee.", "5 We're baptized unto Thy dear name\nNo more our own are we;\nThy steps we'd follow, for Thee live\nAnd e'er be one with Thee."]
