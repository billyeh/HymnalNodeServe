["1 Our times are in Thy hand;\nO God, we wish them there;\nOur lives, our souls, our all, we leave\nEntirely to Thy care.", "2 Our times are in Thy hand:\nWhatever they may be;\nPleasing or painful, dark or bright,\nAs best may seem to Thee.", "3 Our times are in Thy hand;\nWhy should we doubt or fear?\nA father's hand will never cause\nHis child a needless tear.", "4 Our times are in Thy hand;\nJesus, the Crucified,\nWhose hand our many sins have pierced,\nIs now our guard and guide.", "5 Our times are in Thy hand;\nWe'll always trust to Thee,\nTill we possess the promised crown,\nAnd all Thy glory see."]
