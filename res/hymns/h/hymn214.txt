["1 According to Thy gracious word,\nIn meek humility,\nThis will I do, my dying Lord,\nI will remember Thee.", "2 Thy body, broken for my sake,\nMy bread from heaven shall be;\nThy testamental cup I take,\nAnd thus remember Thee.", "3 Gethsemane can I forget?\nOr there Thy conflict see,\nThine agony and bloody sweat,\nAnd not remember Thee?", "4 When to the cross I turn mine eyes\nAnd rest on Calvary,\nO Lamb of God, my sacrifice,\nI must remember Thee-", "5 Remember Thee and all Thy pains\nAnd all Thy love to me;\nYea, while a breath, a pulse remains,\nI will remember Thee.", "6 And when these failing lips grow dumb\nAnd mind and memory flee,\nWhen Thou shalt in Thy kingdom come,\nJesus, remember me."]
