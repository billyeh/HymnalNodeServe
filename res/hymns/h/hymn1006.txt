["1 There is a fountain filled with blood\nDrawn from Immanuel's veins;\nAnd sinners, plunged beneath that flood,\nLose all their guilty stains:\nLose all their guilty stains,\nLose all their guilty stains;\nAnd sinners, plunged beneath that flood,\nLose all their guilty stains.", "2 The dying thief rejoiced to see\nThat fountain in his day;\nAnd there may I, though vile as he,\nWash all my sins away:\nWash all my sins away,\nWash all my sins away;\nAnd there may I, though vile as he,\nWash all my sins away.", "3 Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood\nShall never lose its power,\nTill all the ransomed ones of God\nBe saved, to sin no more:\nBe saved, to sin no more,\nBe saved, to sin no more;\nTill all the ransomed ones of God,\nBe saved to sin no more.", "4 E'er since by faith I saw the stream\nThy flowing wounds supply,\nRedeeming love has been my theme,\nAnd shall be till I die:\nAnd shall be till I die,\nAnd shall be till I die;\nRedeeming love has been my theme,\nAnd shall be till I die.", "5 When this poor lisping, stammering tongue\nLies silent in the grave,\nThen in a nobler, sweeter song,\nI'll sing Thy power to save:\nI'll sing Thy power to save,\nI'll sing Thy power to save;\nThen in a nobler, sweeter song,\nI'll sing Thy power to save."]
