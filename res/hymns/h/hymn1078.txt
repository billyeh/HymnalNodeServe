["1 One sat alone beside the highway begging,\nHis eyes were blind, the light he could not see;\nHe clutched his rags and shivered in the shadows,\nThen Jesus came and bade his darkness flee.", "chorus When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;\nWhen Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.\nHe takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,\nFor all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.", "2 From home and friends the evil spirits drove him,\nAmong the tombs he dwelt in misery;\nHe cut himself as demon pow'rs possessed him,\nThen Jesus came and set the captive free.", "3 \"Unclean! unclean!\" the leper cried in torment,\nThe deaf, the dumb, in helplessness stood near;\nThe fever raged, disease had gripped its victim,\nThen Jesus came and cast out every fear.", "4 Their hearts were sad as in the tomb they laid him,\nFor death had come and taken him away;\nTheir night was dark and bitter tears were falling,\nThen Jesus came and night was turned to day.", "5 So men today have found the Savior able,\nThey could not conquer passion, lust and sin;\nTheir broken hearts had left them sad and lonely,\nThen Jesus came and dwelt, Himself, within."]
