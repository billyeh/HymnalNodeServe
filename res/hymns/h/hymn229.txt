["1 Gathered round Thyself, Lord Jesus,\nWe now seek Thy face;\nMay we know Thy presence with us,\nLord of grace!", "2 Love divine first drew us to Thee,\nIn our sin and need;\nFor our sin, in deep compassion,\nThou didst bleed.", "3 Risen Lord, in glory seated,\nWe are one with Thee;\nThou hast snapt the chains that bound us,\nWe are free.", "4 Gratefully we Thee remember\nAs we break the bread,\nSymbol of Thy body given\nIn our stead.", "5 Drink we too \"the cup of blessing\"\nWhich Thy love has filled;\nThrough Thy blood we have redemption\nFears are stilled.", "6 Backward look we, drawn to Calv'ry,\nMusing while we sing;\nForward haste we to Thy coming,\nLord and King!"]
