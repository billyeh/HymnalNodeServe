["1 Jesus lives! thy terrors now\nCan, O Death, no more appall us;\nJesus lives! by this we know\nThou, O Grave, canst not enthrall us.\nHallelujah!", "2 Jesus lives! henceforth is death\nBut the gate of Life immortal;\nThis shall calm our trembling breath,\nWhen we pass its gloomy portal.\nHallelujah!", "3 Jesus lives! for us He died;\nThen alone to Jesus living,\nPure in heart may we abide,\nGlory to our Savior giving.\nHallelujah!", "4 Jesus lives! our hearts know well\nNaught from us His love shall sever;\nLife, nor death, nor powers of hell\nTear us from His keeping ever.\nHallelujah!", "5 Jesus lives! to Him the Throne\nOver all the world is given;\nWe, in spirit with Him one,\nRest and reign with Him in heaven.\nHallelujah!"]
