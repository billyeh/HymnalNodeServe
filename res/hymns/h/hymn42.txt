["1 By Thee, O God, invited,\nWe look unto the Son,\nIn whom Thy heart delighted,\nWho all Thy will hath done;\nAnd by the one chief treasure\nThy bosom freely gave,\nThine own pure love we measure,\nThy willing mind to save.", "2 O God of mercy-Father!\nThe one unchanging claim,\nThe brightest hopes, we gather\nFrom Christ's most precious name:\nWhat always sounds so sweetly\nIn Thine unwearied ear,\nHas freed our souls completely\nFrom all our guilt and fear.", "3 The trembling sinner feareth\nThat God can ne'er forget;\nBut one full payment cleareth\nHis memory of all debt.\nWhen nought beside could free us,\nOr set our souls at large,\nThe death of God's Beloved\nSecured a full discharge.", "4 No wrath God's heart retaineth\nTo usward who believe;\nNo dread in ours remaineth\nAs we His love receive;\nReturning sons He kisses,\nAnd with His robe invests;\nHis perfect love dismisses\nAll terror from our breasts."]
