["1 There are two lines to live by in our living today-\nOne the life line to bring us into Christ all the way.\nBut the other is knowledge which will make us die;\nWe must be very careful on which line we abide.", "chorus Oh, we'll stay on God's life line, never turning aside.\nWe don't care for vain knowledge, which will cause us to die.\nLord, we'll touch You by calling on Your name each day;\nLiving in Your appearing, in Your presence we'll stay.", "2 Lord, we would be as Abel, fully contacting You;\nNot by knowledge or concept, but by life fresh and new.\nJust as Enosh began to call upon Your name,\nAnd as Enoch who walked with You, we'll do just the same.", "3 Keep us living and walking as did old Abraham;\nIn Your holy appearing to be transfused like him.\nAs did Isaac and Jacob, Moses lived this way-\nSo dependent upon Your presence with him each day.", "4 Full enjoyment had David, ate the life-giving tree.\nDaniel prayed to his God and lived by Him constantly.\nJesus lived by the Father to be life complete;\nNow as His living Body of the life tree we'll eat."]
