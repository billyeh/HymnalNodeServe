["1 \"Be not anxious for the morrow,\nJesus said;\nWhy should we its trials borrow?\nTrust instead!\nFor each hour of need or sorrow,\nGrace He gives, and daily bread.", "2 Thus our treasures safe investing\nIn His care,\nKept in His pavilion resting,\nMay we dare\nStill to trust, thru faith's deep testing,\nSure, God will His ways declare."]
