["1 When is the time to trust?\nIs it when all is calm,\nWhen waves the victor's palm,\nAnd life is one glad psalm?\nNay! but the time to trust\nIs when the waves beat high,\nWhen storm clouds fill the sky,\nAnd pray'r is one long cry.", "2 When is the time to trust?\nIs it when friends are true?\nIs it when comforts woo\nIn all we say and do?\nNay! but the time to trust\nIs when we stand alone,\nAnd summer birds have flown,\nAnd every prop is gone.", "3 When is the time to trust?\nIs it some future day,\nWhen you have tried your way,\nAnd learned to trust and pray?\nNay! but the time to trust\nIs in this moment's need,\nPoor, broken, bruised reed.\nPoor, troubled soul, make speed!", "4 When is the time to trust?\nIs it when hopes beat high,\nWhen sunshine gilds the sky\nWith joy and ecstasy?\nNay! but the time to trust\nIs when our joy has fled,\nWhen sorrow bows the head,\nAnd all is cold and dead."]
