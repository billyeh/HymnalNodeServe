["1 Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd\nBrought us right out of the fold\nInto His pasture so plenteous,\nInto His riches untold.", "chorus Glorious church life,\nFeasting from such a rich store!\nHere where we're dwelling in oneness\nGod commands life evermore.", "2 In the divisions He sought us,\nWeary and famished for food;\nInto the good land He brought us,\nOh, to our spirit how good!", "3 Jesus Himself is our pasture,\nHe is the food that we eat;\nWe as His sheep are fed richly\nEach time, whenever we meet.", "4 Dwell we here on a high mountain,\nWet with the morning-fresh dew,\nSlaking our thirst at the fountain,\nWater so living and new.", "5 Christ is our rest and enjoyment,\nHere we have nothing to fear;\nHere all the sheep dwell securely,\nKept by His presence so dear."]
