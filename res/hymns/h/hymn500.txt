["1 Oh, what a might! Oh, what a strength!\n God wrought to raise Christ from the dead.\n Far above all at His right hand,\n O'er all to us He is the Head.\n All this great pow'r is to the Church\n That she o'er all her foes may tread.\n 2Oh, what a fact! Oh, what a bliss!\n That I of Christ a member am.\n With all the saints I blend as one\n And share the life of the new man.\n Joined to our great ascended Head,\n We'll be the Church of His own plan.\n 3Oh, what a breadth! Oh, what a length!\n The height, the depth unsearchable!\n Christ the Lord is unlimited,\n So vast, immense, immeas'rable.\n All that He is and all He has\n Is now our life unspeakable.\n (Repeat the last two lines of each stanza)"]
