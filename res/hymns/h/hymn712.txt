["1 Be still, my heart! these anxious cares\nTo thee are burdens, thorns and snares;\nThey cast dishonor on the Lord,\nAnd contradict His gracious word.", "2 Brought safely by His hand thus far,\nWhy wilt thou now give place to fear?\nHow canst thou want if He provide,\nOr lose thy way with such a Guide?", "3 When first before His mercy-seat\nThou didst to Him thine all commit;\nHe gave thee warrant from that hour\nTo trust His wisdom, love, and power.", "4 Did ever trouble yet befall,\nAnd He refuse to hear thy call?\nAnd has He not His promise passed,\nThat thou shalt overcome at last?", "5 He who has helped me hitherto\nWill help me all my journey through,\nAnd give me daily cause to raise\nNew Ebenezers to His praise.", "6 Though rough and thorny be the road,\nIt leads thee on, apace, to God;\nThen count thy present trials small,\nFor God will make amends for all."]
