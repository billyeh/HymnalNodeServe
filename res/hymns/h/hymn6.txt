["1 Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty!\nUnto everlasting days our song shall rise to Thee;\nHoly, Holy, Holy, Merciful and Mighty!\nGod in Three Persons, blessed Trinity!", "2 Holy, Holy, Holy! all the saints adore Thee;\nHeaven's elders cast their crowns down by the glassy sea;\nCherubim and seraphim worship too before Thee,\nWho wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.", "3 Holy, Holy, Holy! though the darkness hide Thee,\nThough the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see,\nOnly Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee\nPerfect in power, in love, and purity."]
