["1 How oft believers through the years\nHave sought the will of Jesus,\nAnd would have offered everything\nTo walk as Him it pleases.\nIf you should seek the will of God,\nDon't waste another minute;\nThe church life is His glorious will,\nAnd you too must get in it.", "2 \"What is the will of God for me?\"\nHow oft you've asked this question.\nIt is the church life, corporately,\nWhere God finds His expression.\nDon't watch the church life from afar,\nOr erringly construe it;\nCome gaze upon it from within-\nYou'll give your whole life to it.", "3 The church life here is realized,\n'Tis all the Lord intended;\nAnd in this rich experience\nAll further seeking's ended.\nThe church life is His glorious will-\nNow for yourself begin it.\nThe surest way to know His will\nIs simply to get in it.", "4 So let us give our all for this,\nAnd hold ourselves not dearly;\nThe church life is the will of God,\nLet's take our standing clearly.\nOh, we have found the will of God;\nChrist died and rose to win it.\nThe church life is His glorious will,\nAnd, praise the Lord, we're in it!"]
