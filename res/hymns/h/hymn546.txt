["1 I love my Lord, but with no love of mine,\nFor I have none to give;\nI love Thee, Lord, but all the love is Thine,\nFor by Thy love I live.\nI am as nothing, and rejoice to be\nEmptied, and lost, and swallowed up in Thee.", "2 Thou, Lord, alone, art all Thy children need,\nAnd there is none beside;\nFrom Thee the streams of blessedness proceed,\nIn Thee the bless'd abide.\nFountain of life, and all-abounding grace,\nOur source, our center, and our dwelling-place."]
