["1 Christ is the Alpha of our prayers;\nWe know not how to pray\nSave as His Spirit in our hearts\nShall teach us what to say.", "2 Christ is the Omega of prayer,\nThe Father's great Amen\nThat rounds our halting periods\nTo sense beyond our ken.", "3 But in the little space between\nHe lets us make the links,\nAnd with our slow and stammering speech\nInterpret what He thinks.", "4 O First and Last, take Thou the prayers\nOf every trusting soul,\nAnd weld them to Thine own desire\nTo make a perfect whole.", "5 Thou great Beginning of that Word\nWe cannot speak or spell,\nOf the short syllable we lisp\nBe Thou the End as well!"]
