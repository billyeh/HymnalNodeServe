["1 Simply trusting every day;\nTrusting through a stormy way;\nEven when my faith is small,\nTrusting Jesus, that is all.", "chorus Trusting as the moments fly,\nTrusting as the days go by,\nTrusting Him, whate'er befall,\nTrusting Jesus, that is all.", "2 Brightly doth His Spirit shine\nInto this poor heart of mine;\nWhile He leads I cannot fall,\nTrusting Jesus, that is all.", "3 Singing if my way be clear,\nPraying if the path be drear;\nIf in danger, for Him call,\nTrusting Jesus, that is all.", "4 Trusting Him while life shall last,\nTrusting Him till earth is past,\nTill His gracious advent call,\nTrusting Jesus, that is all."]
