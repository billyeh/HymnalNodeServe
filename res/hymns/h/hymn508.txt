["1 Made free! Made free! O captive!\nBound by the law of sin,\nThe law of life in Spirit\nWill quicken you within.\nAnd counting on the Spirit,\nHis life shall now control\nThe members of your body,\nThe portals of your soul.", "2 Made free! Made free in Jesus:\nFor crucified with Him,\nFrom center to circumf'rence,\nHe breaks the power of sin.\nNo longer act in body\nAs if it had no \"law\";\nHis \"law of life\" must govern\nAll that ran wild before.", "3 Made free! Made free in Jesus:\nDeep planted in His death,\nHe liberates His life pow'r,\nAnd breathes His Spirit's breath.\nThen waxing strong in spirit,\nWith force of quickening life;\nThe soul and body governed,\nIts members cease from strife!", "4 Made free! Made free in Jesus:\nJoined to the Risen One,\nBy conflict prayer you triumph,\nAnd claim His victory won.\nFreed with His glorious freedom,\nAbove the darkness rife;\nFor now the law of sin and death\nIs conquered by His life."]
