["1 Cast thou thy care upon the Lord,\nThe care that loads thy heart;\nTake Him this moment at His word,\nAnd let Him do His part.", "2 The need is deep, the care is great,\nThe burden hard to bear;\nRoll it on Him with all its weight,\nAnd leave it resting there.", "3 This heavy thing, it is His gift,\nHis portion, thee to bless;\nGive it Him back; what He shall lift\nNo more on thee shall press.", "4 Cast all thy care, and not a part,\nThe great things and the small;\nThe Lord's all-loving, mighty heart\nHas room and thought for all.", "5 Yes, He will ponder every care,\nConsider each detail;\nThyself, thy burden, let Him bear;\nHe will not, cannot, fail."]
