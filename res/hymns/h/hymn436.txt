["1 Thy Life was giv'n for me,\nThy blood, O Lord, was shed,\nThat I might ransomed be,\nAnd quickened from the dead;\nThy Life was giv'n for me, for me;\nWhat have I giv'n for Thee?", "2 Long years were spent for me\nIn weariness and woe,\nThat through eternity\nThy glory I might know;\nLong years were spent for me, for me;\nHave I spent one for Thee?", "3 Thy Father's home of light,\nThy rainbow-circled throne,\nWere left for earthly night,\nFor wanderings sad and lone;\nYea, all was left for me, for me;\nHave I left aught for Thee?", "4 Thou, Lord, hast borne for me\nMore than my tongue can tell\nOf bitterest agony,\nTo rescue me from hell;\nThou suff'redst all for me, for me;\nWhat have I borne for Thee?", "5 And Thou hast brought to me\nDown from Thy home above\nSalvation full and free,\nThy pardon and Thy love;\nGreat gifts, great gifts Thou broughtest me;\nWhat have I brought to Thee?", "6 Oh, let my life be given,\nMy years for Thee be spent;\nWorld-fetters all be riven,\nAnd joy with suff'ring blent;\nThou gav'st Thyself for me, for me,\nI give myself to Thee."]
