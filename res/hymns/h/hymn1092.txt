["1 The saints throughout the centuries\nHave praised the Lord that He,\nThe Lamb of God, has saved us,\nFrom sin has set us free;\nYet scarcely for the Lion\nHave we yet sounded praise,\nThough oft for our redemption\nWe've all our voices raised.", "2 John wept as he considered\nThat none the right did own\nThe scroll to take and open,\nGod's myst'ry to make known;\nNo, none on earth nor heaven,\nNor universe around-\nAnd we, too, would be weeping\nIf none were worthy found.", "3 The universe, mysterious,\nWould be in darkness still,\nCould none break through to open\nThe scroll, to show God's will;\nBut, lo, the worthy Lion\nOf Judah hath prevailed\nThe seven seals to open,\nAnd have the scroll unveiled.", "4 No longer now in darkness\nGod's secret is enclosed,\nBut to our inner vision\nIt's open, full, disclosed;\nOur hearts are for this purpose,\nOur lives are for His plan;\nAnd for this revelation\nWe praise the Lion-Lamb!", "5 The four-and-twenty elders\nAll fall before that sight.\nThe living creatures praise Him,\nWho rest not, day nor night.\nSo let us join their praises\nTo Him who loosed God's plan;\nWe'll lift with theirs our voices\nTo praise the Lion-Lamb!"]
