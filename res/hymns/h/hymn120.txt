["1 The Lord is ris'n; and death's dark judgment flood\nIs passed, in Him who bought us with His blood.\nThe Lord is ris'n: \"we stand beyond the doom\nOf all our sin, through Jesus' empty tomb.", "2 The Lord is ris'n: \"with Him we also rose,\nAnd in His grave see vanquished all our foes.\nThe Lord is ris'n: \"beyond the judgment land,\nIn Him, in resurrection-life we stand.", "3 The Lord is ris'n: \"and now redeemed to God,\nWe tread the desert which His feet have trod.\nThe Lord is ris'n: \"the sanctu'ry's our place,\nWhere now we dwell before the Father's face.", "4 The Lord is ris'n: \"the Lord is gone before.\nWe long to see Him, and to sin no more.\nThe Lord is ris'n: \"our triumph-shout shall be,\n\"Thou hast prevailed! Thy people, Lord, are free!\""]
