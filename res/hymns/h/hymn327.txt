["1 Before the throne of God above\nI have a strong, a perfect plea;\nA great High Priest, whose Name is Love,\nWho ever lives and pleads for me.", "2 My name is graven on His hands,\nMy name is written on His heart;\nI know that while with God He stands\nNo tongue can bid me thence depart.", "3 When Satan tempts me to despair,\nAnd tells me of the guilt within,\nUpward I look, and see Him there\nWho made an end of all my sin.", "4 Because the sinless Savior died,\nMy sinful soul is counted free;\nFor God, the Just, is satisfied\nTo look on Him and pardon me.", "5 Behold Him there, the risen Lamb!\nMy perfect, spotless Righteousness,\nThe great unchangeable I AM,\nThe King of glory and of grace.", "6 One with Himself, I cannot die;\nMy soul is purchased by His blood;\nMy life is hid with Christ on high,\nWith Christ, my Savior and my God."]
