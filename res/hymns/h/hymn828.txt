["1 The \"churches\" here below, so narrow bound,\nReach not the hungry throngs which us surround;\nThey run partway with truth, but miss the goal.\nEarth-vision blurred and dim, their eyes doth hold-\nBut broken gleams have they of radiance gold;\nToo dazzling is the splendor of the whole.", "2 Brothers with brothers have not all one heart,\nIn wrath they turn away and walk apart,\nWho from one stream of life had common birth.\nWhat fight for forms! O'er doctrines what vain strife!\nInstead together sharing God's one life,\nWho worshipped is by heaven and by earth.", "3 \"Where is the truth?\" I asked; for this I longed:\nNone answered right 'mid all the answering throng;\nFor ever side by side lay light and shade.\n\"Where is,\" I cried, \"the one communion pure?\nWhere is the Church in which, clear-traced and sure,\nThe Spirit's very likeness is portrayed?\"", "4 So sought I long, and hopeless was my quest;\nThese eyes grew dim and blind and found no rest,\nTill God's touch opened them, and I was freed.\nI found the Spirit's Church in souls made one\nIn this, that they in troth to Christ had come-\nHis Bride, to follow where the cross may lead.", "5 Thus when I see this small world's narrow thought,\nBehold the brother not with brother brought,\nYet serving Christ-as each one deemeth right-\nAh, then a voice from realms of glory calls,\nWhere the last veil is rent and earthward falls,\nAnd where God's love, eternal, burneth bright.", "6 No more we put that query without end,\nTo which self-chosen church our feet did trend-\nWhat doctrines we believed, what sacred rites.\nIn Christ we were in bonds that nought could break;\nWho, by His cross and death, do all forsake,\nSuch as were far asunder He unites.", "7 No longer does one heed mere formal phrase,\nOr seek for others' creeds through winding maze,\nFor in Himself was truth made manifest.\nAnd out of every tongue and every land\nHe formed one Church to meet His own demand-\nHis Body, where His fulness is expressed."]
