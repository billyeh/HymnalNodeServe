["1 In spirit and reality\nWe meet to worship Thee,\nAnd every principality\nMust fall down or must flee.\nReality, reality,\nO what a joy to see,\nThat Christ may be enjoyed by us\nAs our reality.", "2 A Person, Thou hast come in us,\nInto our spirit now,\nAnd quickened us until we know\nOur inner man art Thou.\nO praise Thee, Lord, we sense Thee thus,\nForever inwardly;\nThy Person in each one of us\nIs our reality.", "3 And now the corporate life we live-\nChrist in His Body known;\nWhere every portion adds more Christ,\nUntil the whole is shown.\nO Hallelujah, one new man!\nOur portions blend as one;\nIn one accord, express the Lord,\nAnd He will quickly come."]
