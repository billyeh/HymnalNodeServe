["1 The name of Jesus is so sweet,\nI love its music to repeat;\nIt makes my joys full and complete,\nThe precious name of Jesus.", "chorus Jesus! oh, how sweet the name,\nJesus! every day the same;\nJesus! let all saints proclaim\nIts worthy praise forever.", "2 I love the name of Him whose heart\nKnows all my griefs and bears a part;\nWho bids all anxious fears depart,\nI love the name of Jesus.", "3 That name I fondly love to hear,\nIt never fails my heart to cheer,\nIts music dries the falling tear;\nExalt the name of Jesus.", "4 No word of man can ever tell\nHow sweet the name I love so well,\nOh, let its praises ever swell,\nOh, praise the name of Jesus."]
