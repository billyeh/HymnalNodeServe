["1 Hold Thou my hand: \"so weak I am, and helpless;\nI dare not take one step without Thy aid.\nHold Thou my hand: \"for then, O Loving Savior,\nNo dread of ill shall make my soul afraid.", "2 Hold Thou my hand: \"and closer, closer draw me\nTo Thy dear self, my hope, my joy, my all;\nHold Thou my hand: \"lest haply I should wander,\nAnd missing Thee, my trembling feet should fall.", "3 Hold Thou my hand: \"the way is dark before me\nWithout the sunlight of Thy face divine;\nBut when by faith I catch its radiant glory,\nWhat heights of joy, what rapturous songs are mine."]
