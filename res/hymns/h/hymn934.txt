["1 I cannot tell why He, whom angels worship,\nShould set His love upon the sons of men,\nOr why, as Shepherd, He should seek the wand'rers,\nTo bring them back, they know not how or when.\nBut this I know, that He was born of Mary,\nWhen Bethl'hem's manger was His only home,\nAnd that He lived at Nazareth and labored,\nAnd so the Savior, Savior of the world, is come.", "2 I cannot tell how silently He suffered,\nAs with His peace He graced this place of tears,\nOr how His heart upon the Cross was broken,\nThe crown of pain to three and thirty years.\nBut this I know, He heals the broken-hearted,\nAnd stays our sin, and calms our lurking fear,\nAnd lifts the burden from the heavy laden,\nFor yet the Savior, Savior of the world, is here.", "3 I cannot tell how He will win the nations,\nHow He will claim His earthly heritage,\nHow satisfy the needs and aspirations\nOf east and west, of sinner and of sage.\nBut this I know, all flesh shall see His glory,\nAnd He shall reap the harvest He has sown,\nAnd some glad day His sun shall shine in splendor\nWhen He the Savior, Savior of the world, is known.", "4 I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship,\nWhen, at His bidding, every storm is stilled,\nOr who can say how great the jubilation\nWhen all the hearts of men with love are filled.\nBut this I know, the skies will thrill with rapture,\nAnd myriad, myriad human voices sing,\nAnd earth to heaven, and heaven to earth, will answer:\nAt last the Savior, Savior of the world, is King."]
