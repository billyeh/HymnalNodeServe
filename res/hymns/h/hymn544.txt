["1 Lord Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;\nFor Thee all the pleasures of sin I resign;\nMy gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou,\nIf ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, 'tis now.", "2 I love Thee, because Thou hast first loved me,\nAnd purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;\nI love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;\nIf ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, 'tis now.", "3 I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,\nAnd praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;\nAnd say when the death-dew lies cold on my brow,\nIf ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, 'tis now.", "4 In ages eternal of endless delight\nI'll ever adore Thee in glory so bright;\nI'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow,\nIf ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, 'tis now."]
