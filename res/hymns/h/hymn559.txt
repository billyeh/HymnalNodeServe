["1 Savior, I by faith am touching\nThee, the source of every good;\nVirtue now, by faith am claiming,\nThrough the cleansing of Thy blood.", "chorus Touching Thee, new life is glowing\nBy Thy Spirit's burning flame;\nCleansing, purging, Spirit filling,\nGlory to Thy Holy Name!", "2 Touching Thee in faith, I take Thee\nIn Thy riches full and free;\nAll I am I open to Thee,\nAll Thou art Thou giv'st to me.", "3 Touching now Thine outstretched scepter,\nO most mighty King of kings;\nOf Thy fulness now receiving,\nHigh I mount on eagle wings.", "4 Grace and virtue, strength and wisdom,\nAll my need, by Thee supplied;\nKeep me touching, keep me claiming,\nKeep me ever at Thy side."]
