["1 Of the Father's love begotten,\nEre the worlds began to be,\nHe is Alpha and Omega,\nHe the source, the ending He,\nOf the things that are and have been,\nAnd that future years shall see,\nEvermore and evermore.", "2 This is He whom they in old time\nChanted of with one accord,\nWhom the voices of the prophets\nPromised in their faithful word;\nNow He shines, the long-expected;\nLet creation praise its Lord,\nEvermore and evermore.", "3 O ye heights of heav'n, adore Him;\nAngel hosts, His praises sing;\nAll dominions, bow before Him,\nAnd extol our Lord and King.\nLet no tongue on earth be silent,\nEvery voice in concert ring,\nEvermore and evermore.", "4 Christ, to Thee, with God the Father,\nAnd, with Holy Ghost, to Thee,\nHymn and chant and high thanksgiving,\nAnd unwearied praises be;\nHonor, glory, and dominion,\nAnd eternal victory,\nEvermore and evermore."]
