["1 When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion,\nWe were like them that dream,\nWe were like them that dream.", "2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter,\nAnd our tongue with singing:\nThen said they among the nations,\nThe Lord hath done great things,\nThe Lord hath done great things for them.", "chorus The Lord hath done great things for us;\nWhereof we are glad.\nThe Lord hath done great things for us;\nWhereof we are glad.", "3 Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams,\nAs the streams in the south,\nAs the streams in the south.", "4 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy,\nThey that sow in tears shall reap in joy.", "5 He that goeth forth and weepeth,\nBearing precious seed, shall doubtless,\nCome again with rejoicing,\nCome again with rejoicing,\nBringing his sheaves with him.", "chorus The Lord hath done great things for us;\nWhereof we are glad.\nThe Lord hath done great things for us;\nWhereof we are glad.", "6 When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion,\nWe were like them that dream,\nWe were like them that dream."]
