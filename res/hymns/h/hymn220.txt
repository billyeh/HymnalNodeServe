["1 When on Thy table, Lord, we gaze\nWe marvel at the signs:\nA loaf of bread, a cup of wine\nDisplayed as God designs.", "2 The loaf portrays the bread of life,\nAs heav'nly food to us\nImparted by Thy mystic death,\nThat we may share Thee thus.", "3 The portion is the cup divine\nComposed of Jesus' blood;\nThis cup of blessing we receive,\nAnd gain what is of God.", "4 We eat of Thee, the Bread of life\nBy sharing here this bread;\nThus we remember Thee in love,\nAnd with Thyself are fed.", "5 We all enjoy the blessings gained,\nBy drinking of this cup;\nThus we remember Thee with joy\nTill we are taken up.", "6 By feasting on this bread and cup,\nThy death we now declare\nAnd testify Thou art our life,\nAnd all we daily share.", "7 We're waiting for that glorious hour\nWhen in the fullest way,\nWe'll feed on Thee and feast with Thee,\nAnd worship Thee for aye."]
