["1 She only touched the hem of His garment\nAs to His side she stole,\nAmid the crowd that gathered around Him;\nAnd straightway she was whole.", "chorus Oh, touch the hem of His garment,\nAnd thou, too, shalt be free!\nHis healing pow'r this very hour\nShall give new life to thee!", "2 She came in fear and trembling before Him,\nShe knew her Lord had come,\nShe felt that from Him virtue had healed her,\nThe mighty deed was done.", "3 He turned with \"Daughter, be of good comfort,\nThy faith hath made thee whole\";\nAnd peace that passeth all understanding\nWith gladness filled her soul."]
