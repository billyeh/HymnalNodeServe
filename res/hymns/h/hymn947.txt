["1 God's Kingdom today is a real exercise\nBut when Christ comes to reign it will be a great prize;\nIt is wisdom divine that we now may be trained,\nThat His plan be fulfilled and His justice maintained.", "2 God's children, we're born to be kings with His Son\nAnd we need to be trained that we may overcome,\nAnd to know how to rule in His kingdom as kings\nThat His kingship thru us be expressed o'er all things.", "3 Today we must learn to submit to His throne\nHow to have a strict life and His government own;\nHis authority then we'll be able to share\no'er the nations to rule with God's Son as the heir.", "4 With a life strict to self we must righteousness hold\nKind to others in peace, and with God joyful, bold;\nIn the Kingdom's reality e'er to remain\nFor its manifestation prepared thus to reign.", "5 Then Christ when He comes with the kingdom from God,\nWill to us grant His kingship to share as reward;\nThus the Lord will His righteousness thru us maintain,\nAnd His wisdom to heavenly powers make plain.", "6 For this the Apostle pressed on at all cost\nFor the Kingdom assured that he would not be lost;\n'Tis for this he charged others, Be true to the Lord.\nThat the Kingdom might be unto them a reward.", "7 O Lord, give us grace for Thy Kingdom to live\nTo be trained that Thou may the reward to us give;\nMake the Kingdom's reality our exercise\nThat its manifestation may be our great prize."]
