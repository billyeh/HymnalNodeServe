["1 Naught have I gotten but what I received;\nGrace hath bestowed it since I have believed;\nBoasting excluded, pride I abase;\nI'm only a sinner saved by grace!", "chorus Only a sinner saved by grace!\nOnly a sinner saved by grace!\nThis is my story, to God be the glory,\nI'm only a sinner saved by grace!", "2 Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart,\nCausing my footsteps from God to depart;\nJesus hath found me, happy my case;\nI now am a sinner saved by grace!", "3 Tears unavailing, no merit had I;\nMercy had saved me, or else I must die;\nSin had alarmed me, fearing God's face;\nBut now I'm a sinner saved by grace!", "4 Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows,\nLoving his Savior to tell what he knows;\nOnce more to tell it, would I embrace-\nI'm only a sinner saved by grace!"]
