["1 There is life for a look at the Crucified One,\nThere is life at this moment for thee;\nThen look, sinner, look unto Him and be saved,\nUnto Him who was nailed to the tree.", "chorus Look! look! look and live!\nThere is life for a look at the Crucified One,\nThere is life at this moment for thee.", "2 Oh, why was He there as the Bearer of sin,\nIf on Jesus thy guilt was not laid?\nOh, why from His side flowed the sin-cleansing blood,\nIf His dying thy debt has not paid?", "3 It is not thy tears of repentance or prayers,\nBut the blood, that redeemeth the soul;\nOn Him, then, who shed it, thou mayest at once\nThy weight of iniquities roll.", "4 Then doubt not thy welcome, since God has declared\nThere remaineth no more to be done;\nThat once in the end of the world He appeared,\nAnd completed the work He begun.", "5 Then take with rejoicing from Jesus at once\nThe life everlasting He gives;\nAnd know with assurance, thou never canst die\nSince Jesus, thy Righteousness, lives."]
