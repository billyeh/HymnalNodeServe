["1 How I love Thee, precious Jesus,\nThat Thy love laid hold of me;\nThou hast drawn and wooed and kissed me\nThat a lover I may be!", "chorus Our Beloved, how we love Him,\nSo attractive, our delight.\nWe are captivated wholly\nAnd are comely in His sight.", "2 As a company of horses,\nThou, O Lord, has likened me,\nStrong and swift, with Pharaoh's chariots,\nFull of natural energy.", "3 Just a lover with the dove's eyes\nFixed on Him and Him alone;\nChanged are all my natural concepts,\nOh, the Lord in me has grown!", "4 Now a lily of the valley,\nStanding out among the thorns,\nIn the Lord alone I'm trusting,\nOf my self-strength I've been shorn.", "5 Make us doves that hide in Thee, Lord;\nBring us to the secret place.\nThere You find our voices sweet, Lord,\nAnd desire to see our face.", "6 Make us then, Lord, smoking pillars,\nComing from the wilderness.\nBy Thy death and resurrection\nAll our natural will suppress.", "7 You desire a couch to rest on-\nWe become a rest to Thee;\nThou the Person in our being,\nGone our personality.", "8 Now a palanquin You're making-\nNothing natural You'll allow.\nFor Your move and Your expression\nStart this work within us now!", "9 You supply the wood and pillars\nFor the structure and support,\nBottom gold and seat of purple\nFor our King of royal court.", "10 Only this, O Lord, we offer\nFor Thy palanquin so fine:\n\nJust our love, so pure and fitted,\nThe interior design.", "11 What a sight when our Beloved\nWears a crown upon His brow;\nChrist, the Church, are now united-\nBoast and glory to Him now!"]
