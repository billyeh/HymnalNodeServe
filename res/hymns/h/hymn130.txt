["1 See the Conqu'ror mount in triumph,\nSee the King in royal state\nRiding on the clouds His chariot\nTo His heav'nly palace gate;\nHark! The choirs of angel voices\nJoyful hallelujahs sing,\nAnd the portals high are lifted\nTo receive, to receive, to receive\ntheir heav'nly King.", "2 Who is this that comes in glory,\nWith the trump of jubilee?\nLord of battles, God of armies,\nHe has gained the victory;\nHe who on the cross did suffer,\nHe who from the grave arose,\nHe has vanquished sin and Satan,\nHe by death, He by death, He by\ndeath has spoiled His foes.", "3 While He lifts His hands in blessing\nHe is parted from His friends;\nWhile their eager eyes behold Him,\nHe upon the clouds ascends;\nHe who walked with God and pleased Him,\nPreaching truth and doom to come,\nHe, our Enoch, is translated\nTo His home, to His home, to His\neverlasting home.", "4 Now our heavenly Aaron enters,\nWith His blood, within the veil;\nJoshua now is come to Canaan,\nAnd the kings before Him quail;\nNow He plants the tribes of Israel\nIn their promised resting-place;\nNow our great Elijah offers\nOf His grace, of His grace,\ndouble portion of His grace.", "5 He has raised our human nature\nOn the clouds to God's right hand;\nThere we sit in heav'nly places,\nThere with Him in glory stand.\nJesus reigns, adored by angels;\nMan with God is on the throne;\nMighty Lord, in Thine ascension\nWe by faith, we by faith, we by\nfaith behold our own."]
