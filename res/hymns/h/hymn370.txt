["1 Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;\nThe darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!\nWhen other helpers fail and comforts flee,\nHelp of the helpless, oh, abide with me.", "2 Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;\nEarth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;\nChange and decay in all around I see;\nO Thou who changest not, abide with me.", "3 Come not in terrors, as the King of kings;\nBut kind and good, with healing in Thy wings:\nTears for all woes, a heart for every plea;\nCome, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.", "4 I need Thy presence every passing hour:\nWhat but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?\nWho like Thyself my guide and stay can be?\nThrough cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me.", "5 I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:\nIlls have no weight, and tears no bitterness:\nWhere is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?\nI triumph still, if Thou abide with me."]
