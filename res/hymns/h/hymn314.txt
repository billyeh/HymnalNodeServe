["1 Sov'reign grace o'er sin abounding,\nRansomed souls, the tidings swell;\n'Tis a deep that knows no sounding,\nWho its breadth or length can tell?\nOn its glories, on its glories,\nLet my soul forever dwell!\nOn its glories, on its glories,\nLet my soul forever dwell!", "2 What from Christ the soul can sever,\nBound by everlasting bands?\nOnce in Him, in Him forever,\nThus th' eternal cov'nant stands.\nNone shall pluck thee, none shall pluck thee\nFrom the Savior's mighty hands!\nNone shall pluck thee, none shall pluck thee\nFrom the Savior's mighty hands!", "3 Heirs of God, joint-heirs with Jesus,\nLong ere time its race begun;\nTo His name eternal praises,\nO what wonders love has done!\nOne with Jesus, one with Jesus,\nBy eternal union one.\nOne with Jesus, one with Jesus,\nBy eternal union one.", "4 On such love, my soul, still ponder,\nLove, so great, so rich, so free;\nSay, while lost in holy wonder,\nWhy, O Lord, such love to me?\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nGrace shall reign eternally!\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nGrace shall reign eternally!"]
