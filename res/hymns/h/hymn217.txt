["1 On that night of nights most solemn,\nJesus called His own\n'Round the table of remembrance,\nAll alone.", "2 Then this feast of feasts He ordered,\nFeast of grace Divine;\nSacred symbols He appointed,\nBread and wine.", "3 Thus His death of deaths is shadowed\nIn this simple way,\nLooking backward, pointing upward,\nTo that day.", "4 Till the morn of morns bright dawning,\nEarth's dark shadows passed;\nAnd the splendor of God's glory\nBreaks at last.", "5 Thus the day of days shall open,\nDeathless, cloudless, fair;\nIn that day, the Savior's glories\nWe shall share!"]
