["1 Thy Word is like a storehouse, Lord,\nWith full provision there,\nAnd everyone who seeks may come,\nIts glorious wealth to share.\nThy Word is like a deep, deep mine,\nAnd jewels rich and rare\nAre hidden in its mighty depths\nFor every searcher there.", "2 Thy Word is like a starry host:\nA thousand rays of light\nAre seen to guide the traveler,\nAnd make his pathway bright.\nThy Word is like an armory,\nWhere soldiers may repair,\nAnd find, for life's long battle day,\nAll needful weapons there.", "3 O may I love Thy precious Word,\nMay I explore the mine,\nMay I its glorious riches take,\nMay light upon me shine.\nO may I find my armor there,\nThy Word my trusty sword;\nI'll learn to fight with every foe\nThe battle of the Lord.", "4 Word of the ever living God,\nWill of His glorious Son;\nWithout Thee how could earth be trod,\nOr God and Christ be won?\nLord, grant us all aright to learn\nThe wisdom it imparts,\nAnd to its heav'nly teaching turn,\nWith simple, child-like hearts."]
