["1 Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me\nI'm as a bone disjoined and dry;\nO may Thou quicken and restore me,\nAnd with Thy Body unify.", "2 Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me\nMy spirit is so bound and slow;\nO break my shackles and release me\nTo mingle in Thy Body's flow.", "3 Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me\nMy burdened spirit cannot rise;\nMay Thou encourage and revive me,\nTo share Thy Body's full supplies.", "4 Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me\nMy barren spirit has no joy;\nO may Thou satisfy and bless me\nThy Body's riches to enjoy.", "5 Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me\nTo me a true dependence give;\nDeal with my death and isolation\nThat in Thy Body I may live."]
