["1 Oh, how the thought of God attracts\nAnd draws the heart from earth,\nAnd sickens it of passing shows\nAnd dissipating mirth!", "2 'Tis not enough to save our souls,\nTo shun th' eternal fires;\nThe thought of God will rouse the heart\nTo more sublime desires.", "3 God only is the creature's home,\nThough rough and straight the road;\nYet nothing less can satisfy\nThe love that longs for God.", "4 Oh, utter but the Name of God\nDown in your heart of hearts,\nAnd see how from the world at once\nAll tempting light departs.", "5 A trusting heart, a yearning eye,\nCan win their way above;\nIf mountains can be moved by faith,\nIs there less power in love?", "6 How little of that road, my soul!\nHow little hast thou gone!\nTake heart, and let the thought of God\nAllure thee further on.", "7 The freedom from all willful sin,\nThe Christian's daily task;\nOh! these are graces far below\nWhat longing love would ask!", "8 The perfect way is hard to flesh;\nIt is not hard to love;\nIf thou wert sick for want of God,\nHow swiftly wouldst thou move!", "9 Then keep thy conscience sensitive;\nNo inward token miss:\nAnd go where grace entices thee-\nPerfection lies in this."]
