["1 We have come, we have come to the house of God;\nWe have come to the house, whence outflows the flood.\nOn the right, day and night, constant is its flow,\nWatering us and causing fruits of life to grow.", "2 From the house, from the house flows this living stream,\nFrom the house, to the earth, with the life supreme.\nYet more deep, Lord, we seek that the flow may be;\nThus we must be measured and possessed by Thee.", "3 Measure us, measure us, measure every day;\nMeasure us, measure more, measure all the way,\nTill we know that the flow is a mighty flood,\nSweeping over all the earth for Christ the Lord.", "4 Take us through, take us through, take us through the flow;\nTake us through, through and through, everywhere we go.\nFlow increase, never cease, till we swim in Thee,\nTill we are immersed in God eternally.", "5 All shall live, all shall live where the river comes;\nAll shall live, really live, everywhere it runs.\nLet the fount from this mount life abundant bring,\nTill the deserts of the earth with churches spring!"]
