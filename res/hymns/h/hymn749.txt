["1 The Spirit of the triune God,\nWithin our spirit now doth rest;\nHe ever seeks thru us to flow\nThat God in Christ may be expressed.", "2 But by the outward, natural man,\nThe Spirit is confined within;\nInstead of giving Him a home\nA prison we've become to Him.", "3 He's like a treasure of great worth,\nContained in vessels earthen-made;\nThe vessel must be broken through,\nAnd thus the treasure be displayed.", "4 Oh, how the Lord our self must break\nOur outward man does so impede!\nIt must be broken thoroughly\nAnd thus the Spirit will be freed.", "5 This is the reason why the Lord,\nFor us a certain measure makes,\nOf circumstantial suffering;\n'Tis thus our outward man He breaks.", "6 The outward man, the self, the soul\nMust be consumed, must be decreased;\nThe inner man, our spirit, then,\nShall with the Spirit be released.", "7 Lord, grant Thy holy brokenness\nDeliver me from being whole;\nAnd make me willing to receive,\nThe wounds that Thou wouldst give my soul.", "8 Oh, cause me to appreciate,\nThy breaking, never to complain;\nAnd grant that I may value more,\nAll kinds of loss instead of gain."]
