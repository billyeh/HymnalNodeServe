["1 Encamped along the hills of light,\nYe Christian soldiers rise,\nAnd press the battle ere the night\nShall veil the glowing skies;\nAgainst the foe in vales below\nLet all our strength be hurled;\nFaith is the victory, we know,\nThat overcomes the world.", "chorus Faith is the victory!\nFaith is the victory!\nO glorious victory,\nThat overcomes the world.", "2 His banner over us is love,\nOur sword the Word of God;\nWe tread the road the saints before\nWith shouts of triumph trod.\nBy faith, they like a whirlwind's breath,\nSwept on o'er every field;\nThe faith by which they conquered death\nIs still our shining shield.", "3 On every hand the foe we find\nDrawn up in dread array;\nLet tents of ease be left behind,\nAnd onward to the fray.\nSalvation's helmet on each head,\nWith truth all girt about,\nThe earth shall tremble 'neath our tread,\nAnd echo with our shout.", "4 To him that overcomes the foe,\nWhite raiment shall be giv'n;\nBefore the angels he shall know\nHis name confessed in heav'n;\nThen onward from the hills of light,\nOur hearts with love aflame,\nWe'll vanquish all the hosts of night,\nIn Jesus' conqu'ring name."]
