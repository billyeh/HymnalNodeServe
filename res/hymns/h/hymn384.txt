["1 My Jesus, as Thou wilt!\nOh, may Thy will be mine!\nInto Thy hand of love\nI would my all resign;\nThrough sorrow, or through joy,\nConduct me as Thine own,\nAnd help me still to say,\nMy Lord, Thy will be done!", "2 My Jesus, as Thou wilt!\nThough seen through many a tear,\nLet not my star of hope\nGrow dim or disappear;\nSince Thou on earth hast wept,\nAnd sorrowed oft alone,\nIf I must weep with Thee,\nMy Lord, Thy will be done!", "3 My Jesus, as Thou wilt!\nAll shall be well for me;\nEach changing future scene\nI gladly trust with Thee.\nStraight to Thy rest above\nI travel calmly on,\nAnd sing, in life or death,\nMy Lord, Thy will be done!"]
