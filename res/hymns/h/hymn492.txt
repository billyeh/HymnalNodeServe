["1 In all thy work, O Lord, Thou didst,\nAt Calv'ry's cross once come to rest;\nYet Thou art working still today\nBut in another form expressed.", "2 Thy saving pow'r Thou still dost show;\nThou still dost speak, enlighten, guide;\nThou and the Spirit in one stream,\nSweep many in Thy living tide.", "3 Through Him Thy power's not withheld;\nThrough Him Thy working does not cease;\nThou still dost comfort and command\nEncourage, strengthen, and release.", "4 Since Thou art with the Spirit one,\nHis coming means that Thou hast come\nAnd His indwelling is Thine own\nSince Thou the Spirit hast become.", "5 He executes within my heart,\nAll Thy desires and Thy demands\nAs for the Father here on earth,\nThou hast performed all His commands.", "6 By knowing Him we know Thyself;\nObeying Him we Thee obey;\nAllowing Him ourselves to fill\nWe're filled with Thee, O wondrous way!", "7 Thou art not far away in heav'n\nLeaving us here alone, apart;\nBut Thou art still on earth; how grand!\nThou livest right within my heart."]
