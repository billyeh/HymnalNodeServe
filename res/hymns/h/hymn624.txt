["1 The heavier the cross, the nearer God;\nNo cross without, no God within!\nThe prince of darkness thus is trod,\nAmid the world's false glare and din.\nOh, happy he, with all his loss,\nWhom God hath set beneath the cross.", "2 The heavier the cross, the better saint;\nThis is the touchstone God applies.\nThe gardens many would be faint,\nUnwet by showers from weeping eyes!\nThe gold by fire is purified;\nThe saint is by much trouble tried.", "3 The heavier the cross, the stronger faith:\nThe loaded palm strikes deeper root;\nThe vine juice sweetly issueth\nWhen men have pressed the clustered fruit;\nAnd courage grows where dangers come,\nLike pearls beneath the salty foam.", "4 The heavier the cross, the deeper prayer;\nThe bruised herbs most fragrant are.\nIf sky and wind were always fair,\nThe sailor would not watch the star;\nAnd David's Psalms had ne'er been sung\nIf grief his heart had never wrung.", "5 The heavier the cross, the more inspired;\nFrom vales to climb to mountain crest;\nThe pilgrim, of the desert tired,\nLongs for the Canaan of his rest.\nThe dove has here no rest in sight,\nAnd to the ark she wings her flight.", "6 The heavier the cross, the easier to die;\nDeath is a kinder face to see;\nOur life's decay we dare defy,\nFrom life's distress we then are free.\nThe cross sublimely lifts our faith\nTo Him who triumphed over death.", "7 Thou Crucified! the cross I bear.\nThe longer, may it dearer be;\nAnd lest I faint while ling'ring here,\nImplant Thou such a heart in me\nThat faith and love may flourish e'er\nTill for the cross the crown I wear."]
