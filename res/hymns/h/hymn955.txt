["1 In the advent light, O Savior,\nI am living day by day;\nWaiting, working, watching ever,\nKnowing Thou art on Thy way.", "2 Separated unto Jesus,\nLoosed from all the world beside;\nBlinded by the advent glory,\nHour by hour would I abide.", "3 So from glory unto glory,\nGladdened by the advent ray;\nAll the path is growing brighter,\nShining unto perfect day.", "4 In the advent light to witness\nTo a dark and dying world;\nThis the holy ordination;\nMay His banner be unfurled.", "5 In the advent light rejoicing;\nSongs of praise along the road\nSeem to make the journey shorter,\nMounting upward to our God.", "6 He is coming! He is coming!\nPass the heavenly watchword on:\nGo ye forth to meet the Bridegroom,\nHail! to God's anointed Son.", "7 See the advent glory breaking;\nFaith will soon be lost in sight;\nFace to face I shall behold Him,\nBathed in His eternal light."]
