["1 Working will not save me;\nPurest deeds that I can do,\nHoliest thoughts and feelings too,\nCannot form my soul anew;\nWorking will not save me.", "chorus Jesus wept and died for me;\nJesus suffered on the tree;\nJesus waits to make me free,\nHe alone can save me.", "2 Weeping will not save me;\nThough my face were bathed in tears,\nThat could not allay my fears,\nCould not wash the sins of years;\nWeeping will not save me.", "3 Waiting will not save me;\nHelpless, guilty, lost I lie,\nIn my ear is mercy's cry;\nIf I wait I can but die:\nWaiting will not save me.", "4 Praying will not save me;\nAll the prayers that I could say\nCould not wash my sins away,\nAll I owe could never pay:\nPraying will not save me.", "5 Faith in Christ will save me;\nLet me trust Thy gracious Son,\nTrust the work that He has done,\nTo His arms, Lord, help me run;\nFaith in Christ will save me."]
