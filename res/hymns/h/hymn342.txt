["1 Years I spent in vanity and pride,\nCaring not my Lord was crucified,\nKnowing not it was for me He died\nOn Calvary.", "chorus Mercy there was great, and grace was free;\nPardon there was multiplied to me;\nThere my burdened soul found liberty,\nAt Calvary.", "2 By God's Word at last my sin I learned;\nThen I trembled at the law I'd spurned,\nTill my guilty soul imploring turned\nTo Calvary.", "3 Now I've giv'n to Jesus everything,\nNow I gladly own Him as my King,\nNow my raptured soul can only sing\nOf Calvary.", "4 Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan!\nOh, the grace that brought it down to man!\nOh, the mighty gulf that God did span\nAt Calvary!"]
