["1 Master, how shall I bless Thy name\nFor love so great to me,\nFor sweet enablings of Thy grace,\nSo sov'reign, yet so free,\nThat taught me to obey Thy word,\nAnd cast my care on Thee?", "2 No anxious thought upon thy brow\nThe watching world should see;\nNo carefulness! O child of God,\nFor nothing careful be!\nBut cast thou all thy care on Him\nWho always cares for thee.", "3 How shall I praise Thee, Savior dear,\nFor this new life so sweet,\nFor taking all the care I laid\nAt Thy beloved feet,\nKeeping Thy hand upon my heart\nTo still each anxious beat?", "4 I long to praise Thee more, and yet\nThis is no care to me;\nIf Thou shalt fill my mouth with songs\nThen I shall sing to Thee;\nAnd if my silence praise Thee best,\nThen silent I will be.", "5 Yet if it be Thy will, dear Lord,\nOh, send me forth to be\nThy messenger to careful hearts,\nTo bid them taste, and see\nHow good Thou art to those who cast\nAll all their care on Thee."]
