["1 One thing I of the Lord desire,\nFor all my path hath miry been:\nBe it by water or by fire,\nOh, make me clean, oh, make me clean!", "chorus So wash me, Thou, without, within,\nOr purge with fire, if that must be;\nNo matter how, if only sin\nDie out in me, die out in me.", "2 I watch to shun the miry way,\nAnd staunch the springs of guilty thought;\nBut, watch and struggle as I may,\nPure I am not, pure I am not.", "3 If clearer vision Thou impart,\nGrateful and glad my soul shall be,\nBut yet to have a purer heart\nIs more to me, is more to me.", "4 Yea, only as this heart is clean\nMay larger vision yet be mine,\nFor mirrored in the depths are seen\nThe things divine, the things divine."]
