["1 Christian, seek not yet repose,\nHear thy gracious Savior say;\nThou art in the midst of foes:\nWatch and pray.", "2 Principalities and powers,\nMustering their unseen array,\nWait for thy unguarded hours:\nWatch and pray.", "3 Gird thy heavenly armor on,\nWear it ever night and day;\nAmbushed lies the evil one:\nWatch and pray.", "4 Hear the victors who o'ercame,\nStill they mark each warrior's way;\nAll with one sweet voice exclaim,\nWatch and pray.", "5 Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,\nHim thou lovest to obey;\nHide within thy heart His word:\nWatch and pray.", "6 Watch, as if on that alone\nHung the issue of the day;\nPray, that help may be sent down:\nWatch and pray."]
