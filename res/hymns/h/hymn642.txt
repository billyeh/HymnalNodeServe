["1 \"Within the Veil be this, belov'd, thy portion,\nWithin the secret of thy Lord to dwell;\nBeholding Him, until thy face His glory,\nThy life His love, thy lips His praise shall tell.", "2 \"Within the Veil,\" for only as thou gazest\nUpon the matchless beauty of His face,\nCanst thou become a living revelation\nOf His great heart of love, His untold grace.", "3 \"Within the Veil,\" His fragrance poured upon thee,\nWithout the Veil, that fragrance shed abroad;\n\"Within the Veil,\" His hand shall tune the music\nWhich sounds on earth the praises of Thy Lord.", "4 \"Within the Veil,\" thy spirit deeply anchored,\nThou walkest calm above a world of strife;\n\"Within the Veil,\" thy soul with Him united,\nShall live on earth His resurrection life."]
