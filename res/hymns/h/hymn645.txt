["1 O soul, are you weary and troubled?\nNo light in the darkness you see?\nThere's light for a look at the Savior,\nAnd life more abundant and free.", "chorus Turn your eyes upon Jesus,\nLook full in His wonderful face,\nAnd the things of earth will grow strangely dim,\nIn the light of His glory and grace.", "2 Through death into life everlasting\nHe passed, and we follow Him there;\nO'er us sin no more hath dominion\nFor more than conqu'rors we are!", "3 His Word shall not fail you, He promised;\nBelieve Him and all will be well;\nThen go to a world that is dying,\nHis perfect salvation to tell!"]
