["1 The churches are the Body\nOf Christ on earth today.\nThey are His testimony,\nThat He may have a way.\nThey are the golden lampstands\nIn cities far and wide.\nThey are His fighting army,\nAnd His beloved Bride.", "chorus The churches, the churches,\nUpon the earth today;\nLord, stir our hearts for Thy desire,\nAnd build us, oh, build us,\nLord, we pray.", "2 Oh, how we need the churches,\nAll of them, great or small!\nWe need their many portions\nTo profit us withal.\nYes, Lord, enlarge the churches;\nWe love their needs to bear.\nEnlarge our hearts, Lord Jesus,\nIn fellowship and prayer.", "3 The Lord's eyes o'er the whole earth\nAre running to and fro;\nThose seven, burning, searching,\nOur heart's desire to know.\nHis purpose-many churches,\nBuilt up in one accord;\nThis golden testimony\nWill thus express the Lord.", "4 And soon will be the coming\nOf our triumphant King!\nHe's coming for the churches\nWhere His sweet praises ring.\nCome, Lord, come reap the firstfruits,\nAs draws the harvest nigh,\nAnd to Thy throne do take us,\nTo reign with Thee on high."]
