["1 Is it raining, little flower?\nOh, be glad of rain!\nToo much sun would wither thee;\nSoon 'twill shine again.\nThough the sky is black, 'tis true,\nYet behind it shines the blue.", "2 Art thou weary, tender heart?\nOh, be glad of pain;\nSweetest things in sorrow grow\nAs the flow'rs in rain.\nGod is watching, thou'lt have sun\nWhen the clouds their work have done."]
