["1 How should the Lord keep back His sword from blood?\n\"The soul that sinneth it shall surely die:\"\nBut ah, can Justice make His counsels good?\nCan Law bring in the glory from on high?\nGrace must provide a Lamb-a Ransom find;\nRedeem by One whom death no more may bind.", "2 \"One poor wise man\" hath cried, O God, to Thee;\nHis blood is counted precious in Thy sight.\nHe liveth, and His name shall ever be\nThy praise, Thy glory, Thy supreme delight.\nBy Jesus' blood-that new and living way-\nGod's priests shall now within the holiest stay.", "3 The blood of bulls and goats for ages failed\nTo purge the conscience, burdened sore with sins;\nThy precious blood, O Lamb of God, prevailed-\nThrough Thee, sweet Peace her endless reign begins.\nThy blood hath made redemption e'en for me;\nComplete I stand, O risen Christ, in Thee.", "4 The precious blood of Christ, it speaketh peace\nTo guilty sinners, groaning 'neath their load;\nTo captive spirits it proclaims release,\nAnd Pharaoh's slaves become the \"hosts of God.\"\nHis flesh is meat-His blood is drink indeed;\nHe died, He rose, His people's cause to plead.", "5 Oh, precious blood! poured freely forth for me,\nMy sins are sunk beneath thy crimson tide.\nNo more before th' Avenger's sword I flee!\nChrist is the Refuge-City, where I hide.\nMy life's dark page, blood-sprinkled, gleameth white;\nMy name shines forth in heaven in words of light."]
