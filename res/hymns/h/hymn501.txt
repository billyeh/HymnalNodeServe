["1 O glorious Christ, Savior mine\nThou art truly radiance divine;\nGod infinite, in eternity\nYet man in time, finite to be.", "chorus Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great\nInexhaustible, rich, and sweet!\nGod mingled with humanity,\nLives in me my all to be.", "2 The fulness of God dwells in Thee;\nThou dost manifest God's glory;\nIn flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;\nAs Spirit, oneness with me sought.", "3 All things of the Father are Thine;\nAll Thou art in Spirit is mine;\nThe Spirit makes Thee real to me\nThat Thou experienced might be.", "4 The Spirit of life causes Thee,\nBy Thy Word to transfer to me.\nThy Spirit touched, Thy word received\nThy life in me is thus conceived.", "5 In spirit while gazing on Thee\nAs a glass reflecting Thy glory\nLike to Thyself transformed I'll be\nThat Thou might be expressed thru me.", "6 In no other way could we be,\nSanctified and share Thy vict'ry;\nThus only spiritual we'll be,\nAnd touch the life of glory.", "7 Thy Spirit will me saturate,\nEvery part will God permeate\nDeliv'ring me from the old man\nWith all saints building for His plan."]
