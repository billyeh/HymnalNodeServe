["1 God is righteous in His doings,\nHe is perfect in His ways;\nJust is He in all His actions,\nAnd He well deserves our praise.\nRighteous was His condemnation,\nRighteous His requirement;\nFor the law had deemed us sinners,\nAnd for judgment we were meant.", "2 Oh, how blest the love that spared us,\nFor the law had judged us dead.\nGod, to meet the righteous judgment,\nPassed it on His Son instead.\nHallelujah! Our Redeemer,\nChrist, to God has purchased us;\nNow enjoying His redemption,\nWe become God's righteousness.", "3 God is holy in His nature,\nHoliness is what He is.\nIn this way He sanctified us,\nMakes our nature one with His.\nSpreading from our quickened spirit,\nHe renews each inward part,\nMoving into all our being,\nMaking home in all our heart.", "4 Oh, how blessed is this process!\nIt's the Lord's life-saving way.\nIt's our constant, real experience;\nIt's our life from day to day.\nAs we're minding just the spirit,\nThen the mind is life to us,\nAnd the Lord in us is gaining\nTransformation marvelous!", "5 Glory is God's true expression,\nAll He is, in full, expressed;\nFinal stage of our redemption,\nBodily made manifest.\nGlory is the consummation\nOf this life which sanctifies;\nOur complete transfiguration\nIs the goal which life supplies.", "6 'Tis for this we wait, expecting\nTo be raptured, glorified.\nThen the earth will see God's fullness;\nChrist completely testified.\nWe fore'er will just express Him,\nNature will rejoice to see\nAll the sons of God in glory\nManifested finally.", "7 By His mercy, we're selected,\nOurs a glorious destiny.\nNot by running, nor by willing,\nBut through God's own sovereignty.\nOnce we were wild olive branches,\nNow the root and fat partake,\nGrafted in, rejoice together,\nGrowing for the kingdom's sake.", "8 As we're daily in this process\nAnd by life are sanctified,\nHow we thank Him for the blessing\nOf the church life He's supplied.\nHere God is our full enjoyment,\nPractical and real to us;\nSons we are, and heirs together,\nIn the church life, glorious!"]
