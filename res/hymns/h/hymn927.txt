["1 O God of burning altar fire,\nO God of love's consuming flame,\nMake pure the flame of our desire\nTo win the lost to seek Thy Name.", "2 There is no coldness, Lord, in Thee,\nOh, keep us kindled lest we bring\nTo our dear Lord of Calvary,\nDead ashes for our offering.", "3 Dead ashes, husk of corn for wheat\nLord of our consecration vow,\nWe gather round Thy wounded feet,\nWe see the thorn about Thy brow.", "4 Oh, by Thy cross and passion, Lord,\nGrant us this plea, this sovereign plea,\nSave us from choosing peace for sword,\nAnd give us souls to give to Thee."]
