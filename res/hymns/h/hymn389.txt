["1 Lord Jesus, I long in Thy presence to live\nFrom morning to evening my one world Thou art;\nO let not my heart be contented or rest,\nWhen loving or seeking what with Thee doth part.\nEach moment, each day, throughout suff'ring and pain\nWhen nought in the world can give comfort or cheer\nWhen sighing and weeping encompasses me\nLord, still all my sighing and wipe every tear.", "2 Each time when I dream of the goodness of life\nI pray Thee, dear Lord, that Thou in it may be;\nO do not allow me to choose by myself\nNor seek any pleasure that's other than Thee.\nEach night when alone in the stillness I lie\nI pray Thee, Lord Jesus, that Thou wilt be near;\nEach morning ere dawn comes, while still in my sleep\nThen whispering call me and open my ear.", "3 Each time, Lord, when reading in Thy holy Word\nI pray that Thy glory may shine on each line\nThat clearly I'll see what a Savior I have,\nAnd how great salvation that Thou hast made mine.\nWhen helpless I come, Lord, to kneel at Thy throne\nI pray Thee to hear me and grant me Thy grace;\nIf thru my shortcomings Thou hear not my prayer\nWithdraw not Thy presence, O hide not Thy face.", "4 Each time when of heavenly blessings I think\nO let my heart long to be raptured to Thee;\nMy only hope here is Thy coming again\nMy only joy there, Lord, Thy presence will be.\nLord, teach me each day in Thy presence to live\nFrom morning to evening my one world Thou art;\nO let not my heart be contented or rest,\nWhen loving or seeking what with Thee doth part."]
