["1 O Lord, we've seen Your purpose to bring the many sons\nTo share in Your full glory and see Your kingdom come.\nWe praise You, Lord, this glory is You, Yourself within,\nSpread out in all Your people to shine in all of them.", "2 Since we received Your life, Lord, a seed's been growing there:\nThe seed of inward glory, the glory we will share!\nBy growing 'til the blossom of glory blooms in full,\nWe'll thus enjoy Your increase and glory bountiful.", "3 Hail! Captain of Salvation! Our heav'nly Pioneer!\nOur praises, midst the battle and tumult, You will hear.\nWe're following our Captain all through the mighty fray.\nOur glorious, faithful Captain sustains us all the way.", "4 Lord, fighting on to glory, You now have gone before;\nNow fighting in Your footsteps we'll conquer o'er and o'er.\nFrom glory unto glory, we'll fight until we see\nThe glory from within us shall manifested be.", "5 Then, Lord, at last the fighting and battle cry will cease,\nAnd we'll appear in glory, Your kingdom and increase.\nThat day we'll be completed, that day Your face we'll see,\nFor in that blessed day, Lord, we'll in the glory be!"]
