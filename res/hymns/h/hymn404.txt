["1 Let me come closer to Thee, Lord Jesus,\nOh, closer day by day;\nLet me lean harder on Thee, Lord Jesus,\nYes, harder, all the way.", "2 Let me show forth Thy beauty, Lord Jesus,\nLike sunshine on the hills;\nOh, let my lips pour forth all Thy sweetness\nIn joyous sparkling rills.", "3 Yes, like a channel, precious Lord Jesus,\nMake me and let me be;\nKeep me and use me daily, Lord Jesus,\nFor Thee, for only Thee.", "4 In all my heart and will, O Lord Jesus,\nBe altogether king;\nMake me a loyal subject, Lord Jesus,\nTo Thee in everything.", "5 Thirsting and hungering for Thee, Lord Jesus,\nWith blessed hunger here.\nLonging for New Jerusalem's fullness-\nNo thirst, no hunger there."]
