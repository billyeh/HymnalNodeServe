["1 O Love divine, how sweet Thou art,\nWhen shall I find my willing heart\nAll taken up by Thee?\nMy thirsty spirit faints to prove\nThe greatness of redeeming love,\nThe love of Christ to me.", "2 Stronger His love than death and hell,\nIts riches are unsearchable:\nThe first-born sons of light\nDesire in vain its depths to see;\nThey cannot reach the mystery,\nThe length, and breadth, and height.", "3 God only knows the love of God;\nOh, that it now were shed abroad\nIn this poor stony heart;\nFor love I sigh, for love I pine;\nThis only portion, Lord, be mine,\nBe mine this better part.", "4 Oh, that I could forever sit\nLike Mary, at the Master's feet;\nBe this my happy choice;\nMy only care, delight, and bliss,\nMy joy, my rest on earth be this,\nTo hear the Bridegroom's voice."]
