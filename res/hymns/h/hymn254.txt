["1 O Lord of life, breathe on us now.\nAnd move within us while we pray:\nThe spring of our new life art Thou,\nThe very light of our new day.", "2 O strangely art Thou with us, Lord,\nNeither in height nor depth to seek;\nIn nearness shall Thy voice be heard:\nSpirit to spirit Thou dost speak.", "3 Thou art our Advocate on high:\nHe is our Advocate within;\nO plead the truth, and make reply\nTo every argument of sin.", "4 But ah, this faithless heart of mine!\nThe way I know, I know my guide;\nForgive me, O my Friend divine,\nThat I so often turn aside.", "5 Be with me when no other friend\nThe myst'ry of my heart can share:\nAnd be Thou known, when fears transcend.\nBy Thy best name of Comforter."]
