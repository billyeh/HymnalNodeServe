["1 How sweet, how heav'nly is the sight,\nWhen those who love the Lord\nIn one another's peace delight,\nAnd so fulfill His Word:", "2 When each can feel his brother's sigh,\nAnd with him bear a part;\nWhen sorrow flows from eye to eye,\nAnd joy from heart to heart;", "3 When, free from envy, scorn and pride,\nOur wishes all above,\nEach can his brother's failings hide,\nAnd show a brother's love;", "4 When love, in one delightful stream,\nThrough every bosom flows;\nWhen union sweet, and dear esteem,\nIn every action glows.", "5 Love is the golden chain that binds;\nThe saints Thy grace thus prove.\nAnd he is glory's heir that finds\nHis bosom glow with love."]
