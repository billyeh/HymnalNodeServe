["1 He has entered! He has entered!\nEvery guest may now depart;\nHe has taken all the chamber\nOf my once divided heart.", "2 He has entered! He has entered!\nVanish every doubt and sin;\nHe has taken full possession,\nHe is Lord of all within.", "3 Long at my poor heart He tarried,\nKnocking with His wounded hand;\nWide at last to Him I opened,\nYielding all to His command.", "4 He has entered! He has entered!\nEvery sorrow now must flee;\nWhere He reigns as King and Master,\nThere no grief can ever be."]
