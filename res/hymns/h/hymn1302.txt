["1 All the signs point to the end,\nChrist soon will be here again;\nWe must be ready for Him-\nJesus is coming again!", "chorus Coming again, coming again,\nTime is swiftly passing by,\nSoon we may hear the midnight cry!\nComing again, coming again,\nAs the wise virgins we must be prepared!\nJesus is coming again!", "2 From soul and self turn away,\nLook unto Jesus today;\nThere is no time to delay-\nJesus is coming again!", "3 Foolish ones never will turn;\nWhen the Lord comes they will learn\nThere is no oil left to burn-\nJesus is coming again!", "4 Wise virgins buy up the time;\nNever drunk with the world's wine,\nFilled in the spirit they shine-\nJesus is coming again!", "5 Let us go forth unto Him,\nNot only with our lamps trimmed,\nBuy the oil now lest they dim-\nJesus is coming again!", "6 Jesus is now on His way,\nWatch, for you know not the day;\nEver in His presence stay-\nJesus is coming again!"]
