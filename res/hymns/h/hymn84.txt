["1 Hark! the herald angels sing,\n\"Glory to the new-born King;\nPeace on earth, and mercy mild;\nGod and sinners reconciled.\"\nJoyful, all ye nations, rise,\nJoin the triumph of the skies;\nWith angelic hosts proclaim,\n\"Christ is born in Bethlehem.\"", "2 Christ, by highest heav'n adored,\nChrist, the everlasting Lord:\nLate in time behold Him come,\nOffspring of a virgin's womb.\nVeiled in flesh the Godhead see,\nHail th' incarnate Deity!\nPleased as man with man to dwell,\nJesus our Immanuel.", "3 Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!\nHail the Sun of righteousness!\nLight and life to all He brings,\nRis'n with healing in His wings:\nMild He lays His glory by,\nBorn that man no more may die;\nBorn to raise the sons of earth;\nBorn to give them second birth.", "4 Come, Desire of nations, come!\nFix in us Thy humble home:\nRise, the woman's conqu'ring seed,\nBruise in us the serpent's head;\nAdam's likeness now efface,\nStamp Thine image in its place:\nFinal Adam from above,\nReinstate us in Thy love."]
