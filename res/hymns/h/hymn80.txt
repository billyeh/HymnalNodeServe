["1 Join all the glorious names\nOf wisdom, love, and pow'r,\nThat mortals ever knew,\nThat angels ever bore;\nAll are too mean to speak His worth,\nToo mean to set my Savior forth.", "2 Great Prophet of my God,\nMy tongue would bless Thy name;\nBy Thee the joyful news\nOf our salvation came;\nThe joyful news of sins forgiv'n,\nOf death annulled, and Thy life giv'n.", "3 Jesus, my great High Priest,\nOffered His blood, and died;\nMy guilty conscience seeks\nNo sacrifice beside:\nHis pow'rful blood did me redeem,\n'Tis worthy of my heart's esteem.", "4 I love my Shepherd's voice:\nHis watchful eye shall keep\nMy wand'ring soul among\nThe thousands of His sheep:\nHe feeds His flock, He calls their names,\nHis bosom bears the tender lambs.", "5 My Savior and my Lord,\nMy Conqu'ror and my King,\nThy scepter and Thy sword,\nThy reigning grace I sing:\nThine is the pow'r; behold I sit\nIn willing bonds beneath Thy feet."]
