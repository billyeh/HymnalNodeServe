["1 Father, to us Thy mercy Thou hast shown\nIn Thine own way;\nSinners like us as dear sons Thou wouldst own\nIn love for aye.\nVessels of mercy, Thou didst us prepare;\nVessels of honor, we Thyself declare.", "2 \"In mercy I delight, not sacrifice,\nThou hast declared;\nThru this Thy mercy, favor in Thine eyes,\nWe all have shared.\n'Tis not of them that will nor them that run\nBut of Thee showing mercy as was done.", "3 Father, Thy mercy with Thy love and grace,\nDid we obtain;\nAnd in Thy mercy, with Thee face to face\nWe'll e'er remain;\nAnd for Thy mercy we would worship Thee,\nThrough all our days and through eternity."]
