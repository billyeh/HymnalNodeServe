["1 I have been through the valley of sorrow and weeping,\nThe valley of trouble and pain;\nBut the \"God of all comfort,\" the \"God of all comfort,\"\nWas with me to hold and sustain.", "2 As the earth needs the clouds and the rain with the sunshine,\nOur souls need both sorrow and joy,\nSo He places us oft in the fire of affliction\nThe dross from the gold to destroy.", "3 When He leads thru the valleys of trouble and sorrow,\nHis mercy and love there we trace;\nFor the trials and sorrows He sends us in wisdom\nAre part of His lessons in grace.", "4 Yet how often we shrink from the purging and pruning,\nForgetting the Husbandman knows\nThat the deeper and closer the cutting and paring,\nThe richer the cluster that grows.", "5 O how well does He know that afflictions are needed;\nHe has a wise purpose in view,\nAnd within the dark valley He whispers to comfort,\n\"Hereafter thou'lt know what I do.\"", "6 As we travel the pathway thru life's shadowed valleys,\nFresh springs of His love ever rise;\nAnd we learn that our troubles, our sorrows and losses,\nAre blessings just sent in disguise.", "7 So we'll follow Him faithfully where'er He leadeth,\nThe pathway be dreary or bright;\nFor we've proved that our God is the \"God of all comfort,\nThe God who gives songs in the night."]
