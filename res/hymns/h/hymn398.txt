["1 O to be like Thee! blessed Redeemer;\nThis is my constant longing and prayer;\nGladly I'll forfeit all of earth's treasures,\nJesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear.", "chorus O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!\nBlessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;\nCome in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;\nStamp Thine own image deep on my heart.", "2 O to be like Thee! full of compassion,\nLoving, forgiving, tender and kind,\nHelping the helpless, cheering the fainting,\nSeeking the wand'ring sinners to find.", "3 O to be like Thee! lowly in spirit,\nHoly and harmless, patient and brave;\nMeekly enduring cruel reproaches,\nWilling to suffer, others to save.", "4 O to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming,\nNow to receive th' anointing divine;\nAll that I am and have I am bringing;\nLord, from this moment all shall be Thine.", "5 O to be like Thee! While I am pleading\nPour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love.\nMake me a temple meet for Thy dwelling,\nFit for a life which Thou wouldst approve."]
