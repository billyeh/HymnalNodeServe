["1 What profit all the labor here?\nThere's nothing new for you and me!\nRemember not the former things\nThey're all vanity!", "chorus Vanity! Vanity!\nVanity! Vanity!\n'Tis chasing the wind\nIt's all vanity!", "2 Man's life is full of grief and pain:\nMuch wisdom bringeth misery!\nIncreasing knowledge addeth woe!\nIt's all vanity!", "3 What good our pleasure and our wealth?\nThough joys we have and family\nWe'll have our worries just the same!\nIt's all vanity!", "4 Days of toil to gain and restless nights:\nThough gained without calamity\nWhen death comes it is gone for aye!\nIt's all vanity!", "5 Remember God in days of youth!\nFear Him, and such will be your gain!\nWith Him you will be satisfied\nFor He is not vain!", "chorus Christ without, all is vain!\nChrist within, all is gain!\nAll things are vain\nChrist only is gain!"]
