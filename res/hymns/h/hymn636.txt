["1 \"If it die,\" oh, hear the message\nFalling from thy Lord,\n\"If it die,\" much fruit it beareth,\n'Tis thy Savior's word.", "2 Would'st thou see life work in others,\nThou thyself must die.\nFall into the ground, be buried,\nLow in darkness lie.", "3 But He leaves thee not in darkness,\nLight shall greet thine eyes,\nAnd in glad new life and glory\nHe shall bid thee rise.", "4 Dost thou crave to tread the pathway\nAnd His life to share?\nAs thou passest thru death's gateway\nHe will meet thee there.", "5 Thou shalt learn the blessed secret,\nHe shall live that dies;\nFrom a life poured out in secret\nShall a harvest rise."]
