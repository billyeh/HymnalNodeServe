["1 My old person has been nullified;\nWith my Lord upon the cross he died;\nNow in nothing shall he be applied;\nHe's dead to me.\nMy new Person in my spirit dwells;\nSpringing in me as a bubbling well;\nFlowing out until each part He fills\nWith abundant life.\nChrist, my Person, in my spirit lives;\nAnd my heart to Him I'd daily give;\nThat my inner man could have a home\nAnd a place to settle down, yes,\nA place to call His own, and-\nThere be my complete reality,\nThere expressing all He is to me,\nLiving in my heart abundantly\nAs my Person real.", "2 By this Person being formed in me,\nI'll a member of His Body be,\nNo more acting individually,\nBut with the saints.\nMore and more our Person He must be;\nThat our natural personality\nBe eliminated thoroughly\nTill Christ is all.\nOnly Christ, our Person, must remain;\nFrom our aims, our goals we must refrain,\nTill the church be only Christ Himself\nBuilt up as the one new man,\nThus fulfilling God's great plan of-\nMingling fully with the human race\nTo obtain a proper dwelling place,\n'Stablishing His kingdom's rule and grace;\nOver all the earth.", "chorus Not Himself just individually,\nBut the church together corporately,\nTaking Christ as all in all, to be\nThe full-grown, perfect man."]
