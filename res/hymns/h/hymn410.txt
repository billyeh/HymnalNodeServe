["1 Oh, for a heart to praise my God,\nA heart from sin set free,\nWith conscience sprinkled by the blood\nSo freely shed for me.", "2 A heart resigned, submissive, meek,\nMy dear Redeemer's throne;\nWhere only Christ is heard to speak,\nWhere Jesus reigns alone.", "3 A humble, lowly, contrite heart,\nBelieving, true, and clean,\nWhich neither death nor life can part\nFrom Him that dwells within.", "4 A heart in every thought renewed,\nAnd filled with love divine;\nPerfect and right, and pure and good,\nA copy, Lord, of Thine.", "5 Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart,\nCome quickly from above;\nWrite Thy new name upon my heart,\nThy new, best name of Love."]
