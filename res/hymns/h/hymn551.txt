Hallelujah!\nI have passed the riven veil,\nHere the glories never fail,\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nI am living in the presence\nof the King.", "2 I'm a king and priest to God,\nHallelujah to the Lamb!\nBy the cleansing of the blood,\nO glory be to God!\nBy the Spirit's pow'r and light,\nI am living day and night,\nIn the holiest place so bright,\nHallelujah to the Lamb!", "3 I have passed the outer veil,\nHallelujah to the Lamb!\nWhich did once God's light conceal,\nO glory be to God!\nBut the blood has brought me in\nTo God's holiness so clean,\nWhere there's death to self and sin,\nHallelujah to the Lamb!", "4 I'm within the holiest pale,\nHallelujah to the Lamb!\nI have passed the inner veil,\nO glory be to God!\nI am sanctified to God\nBy the power of the blood,\nNow the Lord is my abode\nHallelujah to the Lamb!"]
