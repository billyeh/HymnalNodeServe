["1 Freed from self and Adam's nature\nLord, I would be built by Thee,\nWith the saints into Thy temple\nWhere Thy glory we shall see.\nFrom peculiar traits deliver\nFrom my independent ways\nThat a dwelling place for Thee, Lord\nWe will be thru all our days.", "2 By Thy life and by its flowing,\nI can grow and be transformed\nWith the saints coordinated\nBuilded up, to Thee conformed;\nKeep the order in the Body\nThere to function in Thy will\nEver serving, helping others\nAll Thy purpose to fulfill.", "3 In my knowledge and experience,\nI would not exalted be\nBut submitting and accepting,\nLet the Body balance me;\nHolding fast the Head, and growing,\nWith His increase, in His way\nBy the joints and bands supplying\nKnit together day by day.", "4 By Thy Spirit daily strengthened,\nIn the inner man with might\nI would know Thy love surpassing\nKnow Thy breadth and length and height;\nEver of Thy riches taking\nUnto all Thy fulness filled\nEver growing into manhood\nThat Thy Body Thou may build.", "5 In God's house and in Thy Body,\nBuilded up I long to be\nThat within this corporate vessel,\nAll shall then Thy glory see;\nThat Thy Bride, the glorious city\nMay appear upon the earth\nAs a lampstand brightly beaming,\nTo express to all Thy worth."]
