["1 One there is above all others,\nOh, how He loves!\nHis is love beyond a brother's,\nOh, how He loves!\nEarthly friends may fail or leave us,\nOne day soothe, the next day grieve us;\nBut this Friend will ne'er deceive us:\nOh, how He loves!", "2 'Tis eternal life to know Him,\nOh, how He loves!\nThink, oh, think how much we owe Him,\nOh, how He loves!\nWith His precious blood He bought us,\nIn the wilderness He sought us,\nTo His flock He safely brought us:\nOh, how He loves!", "3 Blessed Jesus! would you know Him?\nOh, how He loves!\nGive yourselves entirely to Him,\nOh, how He loves!\nThink no longer of the morrow,\nFrom the past new courage borrow,\nJesus carries all your sorrow:\nOh, how He loves!", "4 All your sins shall be forgiven,\nOh, how He loves!\nBackward shall your foes be driven,\nOh, how He loves!\nBest of blessings He'll provide you,\nNought but good shall e'er betide you,\nSafe to glory He will guide you:\nOh, how He loves!"]
