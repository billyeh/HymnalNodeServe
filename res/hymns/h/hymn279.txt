["1 First the blood, and then the ointment\nCleansing, then anointing comes;\nIf we pass not thru Golgotha\nNe'er to Pentecost we'll come.\nIf the blood has never cleansed us\nNe'er the Spirit's pow'r we'll know\nIf for Christ we'd truly witness\nSelf-life to the Cross must go.", "chorus Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray\nPut my soul-life all away;\nMake me any price to pay\nFull anointing to receive.", "2 Christ, the Rock, must first be smitten\nThat the living water flow;\nWithout death the Spirit's fulness,\nNe'er could dwell in man below.\nIf with Christ we die completely\nWilling thus our all to lose\nHe will clothe us with His power,\nAnd to win the world will use.", "3 First the altar, then the fire\nIf no loss, there'll be no gain;\nIf our all has not been offered\nTo the throne we'll ne'er attain.\nIf to sacrifice we're willing\nAll forsaking, God t'obey\nHe to us will be committed,\nAnd thru us His pow'r display.", "4 First we must prepare the vessels,\nThat the Oil they may contain;\nDig the valley full of ditches,\nThat they may be filled with Rain.\nFirst we must go thru the Jordan,\nEre anointed from above;\nFirst in death we must be baptized\nThen experience the Dove.", "5 When we see the ripened harvest,\nOf the golden countryside\nWe may know that many seeds have,\nFallen to the earth and died.\nEre the fruit of life may blossom\nWe must surely suffer death;\nIf with Christ we've not been buried\nWe'll not feel the Spirit's breath.", "6 Since it must be thus, I pray, Lord\nHelp me go the narrow way;\nDeal with pride and make me willing,\nThus to suffer, Thee t'obey.\nI for greater power pray not\nDeeper death is what I need;\nAll the meaning of the Cross, Lord\nWork in me-for this I plead."]
