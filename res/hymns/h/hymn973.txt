["1 Our goal-the holy city with the Lord,\nIt is our portion, 'tis where He's adored;\nAlthough our bodies still are living here,\nOur spirits with our glorious Lord are there;\nOur spirits with our glorious Lord are there.", "2 Our goal divine-the new Jerusalem-\nThat holy city made for God with men;\nFor all redeemed, who have Thy pathway trod,\nShall have the right to share the bliss with God,\nShall have the right to share the bliss with God.", "3 And every time we toward that city gaze,\nThen every time we long to see Thy face;\nWe long to hear the shout that calls to Thee,\nWith Thee to share Thy God eternally,\nWith Thee to share Thy God eternally.", "4 Our heart's desire is not the peace so sweet,\nOur longed for hope is not the joy we'll meet;\nBut Thou Thyself, Thou art \"our hope,\" O Lord,\nFor 'tis Thyself that will be our reward,\nFor 'tis Thyself that will be our reward.", "5 O Jesus, Lord, we pray Thee hear our cry,\nCome! Bring us to that city from on high!\nThat in that glory we may share with Thee,\nThy loving Self partake eternally,\nThy loving Self partake eternally.", "6 O Lord, Thou sayest, \"I make all things new,\"\nNew heav'ns, new earth, and all within them too!\nOur God Himself our portion then shall be;\nO Lord, come quickly! Take us up with Thee,\nO Lord, come quickly! Take us up with Thee."]
