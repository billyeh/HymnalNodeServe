["1 Grace in its highest definition is,\nGod in the Son to be enjoyed by us;\nIt is not only something done or giv'n\nBut God Himself, our portion glorious.", "2 God is incarnate in the flesh that we,\nHim may receive, experience ourself;\nThis is the grace which we receive of God\nWhich comes thru Christ and which is Christ Himself.", "3 Paul the Apostle counted all as dung\n'Twas only God in Christ he counted grace;\n'Tis by this grace-the Lord experienced-\nThat he surpassed the others in the race.", "4 It is this grace-Christ as our inward strength-\nWhich with His all-sufficiency doth fill;\nIt is this grace which in our spirit is\nThere energizing, working out God's will.", "5 This grace, which is the living Christ Himself\nIs what we need and must experience;\nLord, may we know this grace and by it live\nThyself increasingly as grace to sense."]
