["1 The way of the Cross means sacrifice,\nAs to God you yield your all\nTo be laid on the altar, the place of death,\nWhere fire will surely fall.", "chorus 'Tis the way of the Cross, are you willing for this?\nWhat does bearing the Cross mean to you?\nYou who've given yourself, your all to God!\nTo God are you wholly true?", "2 As the voice of song and prayer we raise,\nHow easy to say, We give all;\nTill some rougher cross lies just before,\nAnd sterner is duty's call.", "3 Do you falter then, or, true to death,\nJust die on the cross in the way,\nTill the fulness of life from the Living One\nIs filling you day by day?", "4 'Tis the plan of life, for you die to live,\nOne with Jesus crucified;\nWith the life alone to be lived through you,\nOf the Risen, the Glorified."]
