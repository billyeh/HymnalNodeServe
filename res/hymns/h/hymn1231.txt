["1 O praise the Lord, God has a plan-\nThat's why He formed a man;\nTo exercise authority,\nSubdue the earth entirely.\nO what a joy to be\nIn His recovery,\nO praise God He made me a V.I.P.", "2 O hallelujah, Christ became\nA man to die for me.\nAnd dying once my life to be,\nIn spirit now He lives in me.\nThe man supreme is He,\nMy all He came to be;\nO hallelujah, He lives in me!", "3 O hallelujah, I'm a man,\nThe center of God's plan.\nI'm God's own image made to be,\nExpressing His authority.\nIt's great to be a man,\nO praise God, I'm a man,\nO hallelujah, I am a man!", "4 O hallelujah, one new man,\nThe building of God's plan!\nGod's plan throughout eternity-\nNot man, but men built corporately.\nThis man cannot be beat,\nAll things beneath his feet,\nChrist and the church one man complete."]
