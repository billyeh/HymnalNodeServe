["1 Jesus, my Lord, to Thee I cry;\nUnless Thou save me, I must die:\nOh, bring Thy free salvation nigh,\nAnd take me as I am!", "chorus And take me as I am!\nAnd take me as I am!\nMy only plea-Christ died for me!\nOh, take me as I am!", "2 Helpless I am, and full of guilt;\nBut yet for me Thy blood was spilt,\nAnd Thou canst make me what Thou wilt,\nAnd take me as I am.", "3 No preparation can I make,\nMy best resolves I only break,\nYet save me for Thine own Name's sake,\nAnd take me as I am.", "4 Behold me, Savior, at Thy feet,\nDeal with me as Thou seest meet;\nThy work begin, Thy work complete,\nBut take me as I am."]
