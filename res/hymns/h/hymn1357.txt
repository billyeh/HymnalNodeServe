["1 What joy fills my heart, fills my heart, fills my heart,\nWhat joy fills my heart!\nGod takes my stone heart, one of flesh imparts;\nHis Spirit renewing gives life to each part.\nWhat joy fills my heart, fills my heart, fills my heart.", "2 Oh, His Spirit fills, fills me now, fills me now!\nOh, His Spirit fills!\nHe drives out my sin, weakness, death, within,\nTo bear fruits of righteousness, holy to Him.\nOh, His Spirit fills, fills me now, fills me now!"]
