["1 Lord Jesus Christ, our heart feels sweet,\nWhene'er we think on Thee\nAnd long that to Thy presence dear,\nWe soon might raptured be!", "chorus Lord, like the pretty henna-flower*\nIn vineyards blossoming Thou art;\nIncomp'rable Thy beauty is\nAdmires and loves our heart!", "2 There is no music adequate,\nThy grace in full to praise\nNor there a heart which could enjoy,\nThy love in every phase.", "3 Yet, what delights our heart the most,\nIs not Thy love, Thy grace;\nBut it is Thine own loving Self,\nThat satisfies always.", "4 Oh, Thou art fairer than the fair\nAnd sweeter than the sweet;\nBeside Thee, none in heaven or earth,\nOur heart's desire could meet.\n* An Old World plant, prized for its fragrant,\nyellow and white flowers.\n(Song of Sol. 1\":14 A.S.V."]
