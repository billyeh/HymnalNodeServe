["1 Jesus! I am resting, resting\nIn the joy of what Thou art;\nI am finding out the greatness\nOf Thy loving heart.\nThou hast bid me gaze upon Thee,\nAnd Thy beauty fills my soul,\nFor, by Thy transforming power,\nThou hast made me whole.", "chorus Jesus! I am resting, resting\nIn the joy of what Thou art;\nI am finding out the greatness\nOf Thy loving heart.", "2 Oh, how great Thy loving kindness,\nVaster, broader than the sea:\nOh, how marvelous Thy goodness,\nLavished all on me!\nYes, I rest in Thee, Beloved,\nKnow what wealth of grace is Thine,\nKnow Thy certainty of promise,\nAnd have made it mine.", "3 Simply trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,\nI behold Thee as Thou art,\nAnd Thy love, so pure, so changeless,\nSatisfies my heart,\nSatisfies its deepest longings,\nMeets, supplies its every need,\nCompasseth me round with blessings,\nThine is love indeed.", "4 Ever lift Thy face upon me,\nAs I work and wait for Thee;\nResting 'neath Thy smile, Lord Jesus,\nEarth's dark shadows flee.\nBrightness of my Father's glory,\nSunshine of my Father's face,\nKeep me ever trusting, resting,\nFill me with Thy grace."]
