["1 O Thou, in whose presence my soul takes delight,\nOn whom in affliction I call,\nMy comfort by day and my song in the night,\nMy hope, my salvation, my all!", "2 Where dost Thou, dear Shepherd, resort with Thy sheep,\nTo feed them in pastures of love;\nSay, why in the valley of death should I weep,\nOr alone in this wilderness rove?", "3 Oh, why should I wander, an alien from Thee,\nOr cry in the desert for bread?\nThy foes will rejoice when my sorrows they see,\nAnd smile at the tears I have shed.", "4 Ye daughters of Zion, declare, have you seen\nThe Star that on Israel shone?\nSay, if in your tents my Beloved has been,\nAnd where with His flocks He is gone.", "5 Dear Shepherd! I hear, and will follow Thy call;\nI know the sweet sound of Thy voice;\nRestore and defend me, for Thou art my all,\nAnd in Thee I'll ever rejoice."]
