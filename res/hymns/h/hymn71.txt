["1 Jesus! how much Thy name unfolds\nTo every opened ear;\nThe pardoned sinner's mem'ry holds\nNone other half so dear.", "2 Thy name encircles every grace\nThat God as man could show;\nThere only could He fully trace\nA life divine below.", "3 Jesus-it speaks a life of love,\nOf sorrows meekly borne;\nIt tells of sympathy above,\nWhatever makes us mourn.", "4 Jesus, the One who knew no sin,\nMade sin to make us just;\nThou gav'st Thyself our love to win,\nOur full confiding trust.", "5 The mention of Thy name shall bow\nOur hearts to worship Thee;\nThe chiefest of ten thousand Thou,\nWhose love has set us free."]
