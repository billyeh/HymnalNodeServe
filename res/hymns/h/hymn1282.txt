["1 Marching on, marching on, in the Spirit\nmarching on;\nHallelujah! the churches march on.\nMarching on, marching on, in the Spirit\nmarching on;\nHallelujah! the churches march on.\nIn the church we see\nThe Lord's recovery\nAnd for it the Spirit seven-strong.\nThe world will know,\nWherever we shall go,\nThat in our age the Lord's marching on!"]
