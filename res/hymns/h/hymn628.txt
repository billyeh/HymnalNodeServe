["1 Via Bethlehem we journey,\nWe whose hearts on God are set;\nBabelike souls of Jesus learning,\nWhile our cheeks with tears are wet;\nFor the manger and the stable\nAre not pleasant to our eyes,\nBut our feet must follow Jesus,\nIf our hands would grasp the prize.", "2 Via Nazareth! the pathway\nNarrows still as on we go,\nYears of toil none understanding,\nYet God teaches us to know\nThat the servant is not greater\nThan the Lord, who through long years\nHid Himself from this world's glory,\nFollow Him! Count not the tears.", "3 Via Galilee, we see Him!\nStones are hurled, and curses hissed\nBy the men who gather round Him,\nHas He not the pathway missed?\nNo! unharmed the Savior passes,\nAnd this rough bit of the way\nWe must travel, since like Jesus,\nNothing can our purpose stay.", "4 Via too, the awful anguish\nOf the hours beneath the trees,\nWhere the hosts of Satan linger,\nAwful hours of anguish these!\nYet we fail not, for God's angels\nMinister to us, and say,\n\"Look, beloved, at the glory,\nConflict is but for a day!\"", "5 Then the Cross! for via Calvary\nEvery royal soul must go;\nHere we draw the veil, for Jesus\nOnly can the pathway show;\n\"If we suffer with Him,\" listen,\nJust a little, little while,\nAnd the memory will have faded\nIn the glory of His smile!", "6 Then the grave, with dear ones weeping,\nKnowing that all life has fled;\n(Fellow-pilgrims, art thou numbered\nWith the men the world calls dead?)\nThence we rise, and live with Jesus,\nThroned above the world's mad strife,\nGladly forfeiting forever,\nAll that worldlings count as life.", "7 On we press! and yonder gleaming,\nNearing every day, we see\nThe great walls of that fair city,\nGod has built for such as we;\nAnd we catch the tender music\nOf the choirs that sing of One\nWho once died to have us with Him\nIn His kingdom, on the throne.", "8 Just a few more miles, beloved!\nAnd our feet shall ache no more;\nNo more sin, and no more sorrow,\nHush thee, Jesus went before;\nAnd I hear Him sweetly whispering,\n\"Faint not, fear not, still press on,\nFor it may be ere tomorrow,\nThe long journey will be done.\""]
