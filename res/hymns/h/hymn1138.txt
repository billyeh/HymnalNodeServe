["1 Lord, Thou art our consecration,\nThou the consecrated One;\nThou hast satisfied the Father-\nConsecration thus was done.\nWhen on earth Thou hadst no pleasure,\nSave to do the Father's will;\nNow Thou livest here within us,\nConsecration to fulfill.", "2 Lord, we praise Thee for the picture:\nConsecration's ram we see,\nBurnt for God's full satisfaction,\nEaten and enjoyed to be.\nThou art now our ram, Lord Jesus,\nOffered for the will of God;\nBy Thy consecration, faultless,\nWe may walk where Thou hast trod.", "3 As we eat Thyself, Lord Jesus,\nConsecrated we become;\nBy Thy wondrous life within us,\nThy obedience is our own.\nNo more need we strive and struggle,\nConsecrated try to be;\nConsecration dwells within us-\nNow our part to eat of Thee.", "4 Lord, we praise Thee, consecration\nIs nought else but Thee as food:\nAs we eat Thee and enjoy Thee,\nWe are all made one with God;\nOne in will and one in purpose\nWe become by eating Thee:\nAs we take and eat Thyself, Lord,\nConsecrated we will be."]
