["1 My will is weak, my strength is frail\nAnd all my hope is nearly gone;\nI can but trust Thy working true,\nTo gently hold and lead me on.", "2 I've tried my best, but still have failed\nE'en as before I've failed and erred;\nThy patience is my only trust,\nTo hold and keep me to Thy word.", "3 Whene'er my heart is lifted up\nHow very near I am to fall;\nI dare not do, I dare not think\nI need Thyself in great or small.", "4 Thou art my Savior, strength and stay\nO Lord, I come to seek Thy face;\nThough I'm the weakest of the weak\nMy strength is nothing but Thy grace."]
