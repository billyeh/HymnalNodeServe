["1 Riches of Christ we should enjoy,\nAnd then His fulness we will be;\nPartaking of His very self\nHis testimony men will see.", "2 Riches of Christ are what He is,\nTo us who are His members true;\nHis fulness is what we become,\nAs body doth to man accrue.", "3 Riches of Christ are typified,\nBy Canaan's produce rich and sweet\nWith which the temple great was built\nThe Church's greatest type replete.", "4 As Eve to Adam fulness was\nSo is the Church to Christ her Head;\nAs Eve from Adam's being came\nThe Church by Christ's own life is bred.", "5 Christ's riches are Himself within\nHis fulness is the Church without\nAs His expression, full of Him;\nThe Church with Christ is built throughout."]
