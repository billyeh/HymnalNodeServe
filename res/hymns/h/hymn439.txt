["1 Utterly abandoned\nTo the Holy Ghost!\nSeeking all His fulness\nAt whatever cost;\nCutting all the shorelines,\nLaunching in the deep\nOf His mighty power,\nStrong to save and keep.", "chorus Utterly abandoned\nTo the Lord of all,\nSeeking all His fulness,\nAnsw'ring His dear call.", "2 Utterly abandoned\nTo the Holy Ghost!\nOh! the sinking, sinking,\nTill the self is lost!\nTill the vessel's emptied\nBroken at His feet;\nWaiting till His filling\nMakes the work complete.", "3 Utterly abandoned\nTo the will of God;\nWalking in the pathway\nThat my Master trod;\nLeaving ease and pleasure;\nMaking Him my choice,\nWaiting for His guidance,\nListening for His voice.", "4 Utterly abandoned!\nThrough eternity;\nMy will never choosing,\nHis it e'er shall be;\nAll my plans and longings\nLost in His sweet will,\nHaving nothing, owning\nAll things in Him still.", "5 Utterly abandoned!\n'Tis so sweet to be\nCaptive in His love-bonds,\nYet so wondrous free;\nFree from sin's dominion,\nFree from doubt and fear,\nFree from every worry,\nBurden, grief or care.", "6 Utterly abandoned!\nOh, the rest is sweet,\nWaiting in His presence\nAt His blessed feet;\nWaiting for the filling\nOf the Host divine,\nWho my inward parts shall\nPerfectly refine.", "7 Lo! His Spirit fills me,\nWith His presence sweet!\nI, in Him, am blessed!\nI, in Him, complete!\nNow the light within me\nNever shall grow dim\nWhile abandoned ever,\nLiving unto Him!"]
