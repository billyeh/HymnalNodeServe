["1 Break Thou the Bread of Life,\nDear Lord, to me,\nAs Thou didst break the loaves\nBeside the sea;\nBeyond the sacred page\nI seek Thee, Lord;\nMy spirit pants for Thee,\nO Living Word.", "2 Thou art the Bread of Life,\nO Lord, to me,\nThy holy Word the truth\nThat saveth me;\nGive me to eat and live\nWith Thee above;\nTeach me to love Thy truth,\nFor Thou art Love.", "3 Oh, send Thy Spirit, Lord,\nNow unto me,\nThat He may touch my eyes,\nAnd make me see;\nShow me the truth concealed\nWithin Thy Word,\nAnd in Thy Book revealed\nI see the Lord.", "4 Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord,\nTo me, to me,\nAs Thou didst bless the bread\nBy Galilee;\nThen shall all bondage cease,\nAll fetters fall,\nAnd I shall find my peace,\nMy All in all."]
