["1 God was born a human being\nAs the Babe of Bethlehem,\nPassed He then through human living,\nPerfect blend of God with men.\nGod, according to His plan,\nLived a mingled life with man.\nHallelujah, Hallelujah,\nHallelujah, Amen!", "2 Then with God this man was blended\nOn the altar as He died;\nGod and man and all creation\nOn the cross were crucified.\nMan and all of God's creation,\nSunk in total termination.\nHallelujah, Hallelujah,\nHallelujah, Amen!", "3 Everything we are was ended,\nTerminated on the cross,\nOnly man in God ascended,\nMan in Adam suffered loss.\nHallelujah, we're elated,\nOur old man was terminated.\nHallelujah, Hallelujah,\nHallelujah, Amen!", "4 Like the grain of wheat that's buried\nIn the earth to be increased,\nGod's own life the death must suffer,\nThus in man to be released.\nOh, the Lord of all be praised;\nGod released in man is raised!\nHallelujah, Hallelujah,\nHallelujah, Amen!"]
