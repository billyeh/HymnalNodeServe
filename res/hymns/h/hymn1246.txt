["1 We give ourselves to follow the churches,\nOneness in Christ display;\nFollow His move in all of the churches,\nStand fast as one this way.", "chorus We must follow the Spirit\nIn all simplicity.\nIn our spirit is Jesus-\nHe follows perfectly!", "2 We give ourselves to follow the followers,\nBy this we truly learn;\nNever desiring to be the leaders,\nBut to the Spirit turn.", "3 We give ourselves the flock's steps to follow\nKnowing the Shepherd's care.\nNow in the churches Jesus is leading\nAnd He is speaking there.", "4 We give ourselves to Thee, O Lord Jesus,\nNever to turn aside;\nWhere'er the Lamb goes, there we would follow,\nFollow whate'er betide.", "5 We give ourselves to enter the kingdom,\nThat marriage feast, with Him;\nCome persecution, suffering, and trials,\nStill we will enter in.", "6 Christ wants some followers here in the churches,\nFollowers of whom to say:\n\"These saw My purpose, followed Me wholly\"-\nMay we be those today!"]
