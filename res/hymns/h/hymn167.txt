["1 How good is the Lord we adore,\nOur faithful, unchangeable Friend;\nHis love is as great as His pow'r\nAnd knows neither measure nor end.", "2 'Tis Jesus the first and the last,\nWho shall guide us through all to the throne;\nWe'll praise Him for all that is past,\nWe'll trust Him for all that's to come."]
