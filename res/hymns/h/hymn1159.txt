["1 Jesus Lord, I'm captured by Thy beauty,\nAll my heart to Thee I open wide;\nNow set free from all religious duty,\nOnly let me in Thyself abide.\nAs I'm gazing here upon Thy glory,\nFill my heart with radiancy divine;\nSaturate me, Lord, I now implore Thee,\nMingle now Thy Spirit, Lord, with mine.", "2 Shining One-how clear the sky above me!\nSon of Man, I see Thee on the throne!\nHoly One, the flames of God consume me,\nTill my being glows with Thee alone.\nLord, when first I saw Thee in Thy splendor,\nAll self-love and glory sank in shame;\nNow my heart its love and praises render,\nTasting all the sweetness of Thy name.", "3 Precious Lord, my flask of alabaster\nGladly now I break in love for Thee;\nI anoint Thy head, Beloved Master;\nLord, behold, I've saved the best for Thee.\nDearest Lord, I waste myself upon Thee;\nLoving Thee, I'm deeply satisfied.\nLove outpoured from hidden depths within me,\nCostly oil, dear Lord, I would provide.", "4 My Beloved, come on spices' mountain;\nHow I yearn to see Thee face to face.\nDrink, dear Lord, from my heart's flowing fountain,\nTill I rest fore'er in Thine embrace.\nNot alone, O Lord, do I adore Thee,\nBut with all the saints as Thy dear Bride;\nQuickly come, our love is waiting for Thee;\nJesus Lord, Thou wilt be satisfied."]
