["1 In those regenerated by the Lord,\nThere is an inner knowledge bountiful;\nThus we the outward teachings do not need\nBut God we inwardly may know in full.", "2 Eternal life, the highest and the best\nPossesses full divine capacity\nThat by this life God's knowledge we may have,\nMore than by knowledge given outwardly.", "3 The law of life is put within our mind,\nAnd on our heart 'tis written sovereignly\nInwardly ruling us that God we know,\nMore than by teachings given outwardly.", "4 Holy anointing in our spirit dwells\nShowing the things of God to mind and heart;\nBy this anointing we God's knowledge have,\nMore than man's teachings can to us impart.", "5 We have the triune God indwelling us\nLiving and acting, working all the time\nThat by the inner sense we have of Him,\nGod we may know in magnitude sublime.", "6 This inner knowledge obviates the need,\nOf outward knowledge, human eloquence\nBut in the spirit we must ever live,\nAnd walk according to the inner sense.", "7 The more we live in Christ, the life divine\nAnd by the inner consciousness behave\nThe more we'll have the inward knowledge true\nAnd on our heart God will His Son engrave.", "8 'Tis by this living inward knowledge gained,\nThat fellowship with God in life we hold;\n'Tis by this hidden knowledge thus obtained,\nGod unto us His fulness doth unfold."]
