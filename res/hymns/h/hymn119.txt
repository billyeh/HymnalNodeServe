["1 Hallelujah, \"He is risen!\"\nJesus is gone up on high!\nBurst the bars of death asunder;\nAngels shout, and men reply:\nHe is risen, He is risen,\nLiving now, no more to die.", "2 Hallelujah He is risen!\nOur exalted Head to be;\nSends the witness of the Spirit\nThat our Advocate is He:\nHe is risen, He is risen,\nJustified in Him are we.", "3 Hallelujah, He is risen!\nDeath for aye has lost his sting;\nChrist, Himself the Resurrection,\nFrom the grave \"His own\" will bring:\nHe is risen, He is risen,\nLiving Lord and coming King."]
