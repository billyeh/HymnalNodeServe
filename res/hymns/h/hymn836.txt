["1 Christ is made the sure foundation,\nChrist the head and cornerstone,\nChosen of the Lord and precious,\nBinding all the Church in one;\nHoly Zion's help forever,\nAnd her confidence alone.", "2 Founded on the Lord victorious,\nChrist the everlasting Rock,\nStands the Church in heav'nly places,\nDreading not the storm or shock;\nBuilt with life divine she ever\nStands against attack and mock.", "3 Though the gates of hades frustrate,\nYet the Church still stands for God,\nOvercoming evil spirits\nBy her Lord's victorious blood;\nAnd at Christ's return in triumph\nAll her foes will then be trod."]
