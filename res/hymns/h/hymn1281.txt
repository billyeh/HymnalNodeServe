["1 All the meetings Christ appointed\nAnd attended here on earth\nWere apart from all religion,\nAll its rituals, forms, and dearth.\nResurrection, not religion,\nMust be our reality;\nLet us meet in resurrection,\nFrom all dead religion free.", "2 When the Lord was resurrected,\nAll religious things were through;\nChrist is now our living temple,\nChrist is all our offerings too.\nWith our Lord in resurrection,\nHallelujah, we're released!\nPity all the old religion-\nAll our meetings are a feast!", "3 Yet religion-oh, how subtle-\nIn our blood is hiding out;\nGod must give us revelation,\nAll that unseen monster rout.\nLord, we still are too religious-\nDown with our religious soul!\nWe would all release our spirit,\nLet each meeting reach the goal.", "4 In the meetings, in the meetings,\nOn the mountain, at the shore,\nJesus, Jesus, living Jesus,\nHe is here-what want we more?\nBury all the old religion,\nEven Christianity-\nJesus, Jesus, we have Jesus,\nHe is our reality!"]
