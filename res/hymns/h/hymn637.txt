["1 \"Wrecked outright on Jesus' breast\":\nOnly \"wrecked\" souls thus can sing;\nLittle boats that hug the shore,\nFearing what the storm may bring,\nNever find on Jesus' breast,\nAll that \"wrecked\" souls mean by rest.", "2 \"Wrecked outright!\" So we lament;\nBut when storms have done their worst,\nThen the soul, surviving all,\nIn Eternal arms is nursed;\nThere to find that nought can move\nOne, embosomed in such love.", "3 \"Wrecked outright!\" No more to own\nE'en a craft to sail the sea;\nStill a voyager, yet now\nAnchored to Infinity;\nNothing left to do but fling\nCare aside, and simply cling.", "4 \"Wrecked outright!\" 'Twas purest gain,\nHenceforth other craft can see\nThat the storm may be a boon,\nThat, however rough the sea,\nGod Himself doth watchful stand,\nFor the \"wreck\" is in His hand."]
