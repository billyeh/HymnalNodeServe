["1 Behold! behold the Lamb of God,\nOn the cross! On the cross!\nFor us He shed His precious blood,\nOn the cross! On the cross!\nO hear His all-important cry,\n\"Eli, lama sabachthani?\"\nDraw near and see the Savior die,\nOn the cross! On the cross!", "2 Behold His arms extended wide,\nOn the cross! On the cross!\nBehold His bleeding hands and side,\nOn the cross! On the cross!\nThe sun withholds its rays of light,\nThe heav'ns are clothed in shades of night,\nWhile Jesus wins the glorious fight,\nOn the cross! On the cross!", "3 By faith we see Him lifted up,\nOn the cross! On the cross!\nHe drinks for us the bitter cup,\nOn the cross! On the cross!\nThe rocks do rend, the mountains quake,\nWhile Jesus all our sins doth take,\nWhile Jesus suffers for our sake,\nOn the cross! On the cross!", "4 And now the mighty deed is done,\nOn the cross! On the cross!\nThe battle fought, the vict'ry won,\nOn the cross! On the cross!\nTo heav'n He turns triumphant eyes;\n\" 'Tis finished\" now, the Conqu'ror cries,\nThen bows His sacred head and dies,\nOn the cross! On the cross!", "5 But now He's ris'n, ascended, crowned,\nOn the throne! On the throne!\nHeav'n's highest place for Him is found,\nOn the throne! On the throne!\nOur hearts we low in worship bow,\nAnd join, as one, to hail Him now:\n\"Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou!\"\nOn the throne! On the throne!"]
