["1 Oh, how glorious! Oh, how precious!\nNow the Spirit dwells in me.\nLife imparting, truth revealing,\nShining, leading constantly.", "chorus Fill me now! Fill me now!\nFill me with Thy Spirit now!\nStrip me wholly, empty thoroughly,\nFill me with Thy Spirit now!", "2 Word of promise, real within me,\nLife divine now freeing me-\nFrom sin's cruel control releasing,\nFrom death's power setting free.", "3 Deepest springs of life dispensing,\nLike the hart I thirst for Thee;\nDesp'rate, may I drink Thy fullness,\n'Till Thy river flows through me.", "4 May my self be put to death, Lord,\nUnder Thy control I'd be,\nTransformed to Thy living image,\nI'd forever flow out Thee."]
