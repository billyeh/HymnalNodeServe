["1 Our hearts are overflowing\nTo speak a goodly thing-\nTo tell what we've experienced\nOf our exalted King.\nOur tongues as pens are ready,\nWe've volumes here to \"write\"-\nThe glories of our Bridegroom,\nOur Lord and our delight.", "2 Lord Jesus, Thou art fairer\nThan all the sons of men;\nThy goodness is transcendent-\nHallelujah! Amen!\nUpon Thy lips most holy\nAbundant grace is poured;\nForever God has blessed Thee,\nOur gracious, glorious Lord!", "3 Thou art the mighty Warrior\nWho rides to victory;\nIn Thy majestic glory\nRide on triumphantly!\nThe peoples fall beneath Thee-\nThe conquering One Thou art.\nThine arrows in their sharpness\nHave entered Satan's heart!", "4 Thy throne, O God, forever\nAnd ever shall endure;\nThe sceptre of Thy kingdom\nUpon the earth is sure.\n'Tis with the oil of gladness\nGod has anointed Thee\nAbove all Thy companions-\nHow worthy there to be!", "5 Of aloes, myrrh, and cassia\nDo all Thy garments smell:\nThy death and resurrection\nDo all Thy deeds forthtell.\nOut of the local churches\nShall praises make Thee glad,\nAnd praises upon praises\nThy joyful saints shall add."]
