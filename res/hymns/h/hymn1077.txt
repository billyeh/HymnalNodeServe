["1 There were ninety and nine that safely lay\nIn the shelter of the flock,\nBut one was out on the hills away,\nFar off in the cold and dark;\nAway on the mountains wild and bare,\nAway from the tender Shepherd's care.", "2 \"Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;\nAre they not enough for Thee?\"\nBut the Shepherd made answer: \"\"This of Mine\nHas wandered away from Me;\nAnd although the road be rough and steep,\nI go to the desert to find My sheep.\"", "3 But none of the ransomed ever knew\nHow deep were the waters crossed;\nNor how dark was the night which the Lord passed through\nEre He found His sheep that was lost.\nOut in the bleak desert He heard its cry-\nAll bleeding and helpless, and ready to die.", "4 \"Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way\nThat mark out the mountain's track?\"\n\"They were shed for one who had gone astray\nEre the Shepherd could bring him back.\"\n\"Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?\"\n\"They're pierced tonight by many a thorn.\"", "5 And all through the mountains, thunder-riven,\nAnd up from the rocky steep,\nThere arose a cry to the gate of heaven,\n\"Rejoice! I have found My sheep!\"\nAnd the angels echoed around the throne,\n\"Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!\"\nnote: \"(Repeat the last line of each stanza)"]
