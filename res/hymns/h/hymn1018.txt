["1 The whole world was lost in the darkness of sin;\nThe light of the world is Jesus;\nLike sunshine at noonday His glory shone in,\nThe light of the world is Jesus.", "chorus Come to the light, 'tis shining for thee;\nSweetly the light has dawned upon me;\nOnce I was blind, but now I can see;\nThe light of the world is Jesus.", "2 No darkness have we who in Jesus abide,\nThe light of the world is Jesus;\nWe walk in the light when we follow our Guide,\nThe light of the world is Jesus.", "3 Ye dwellers in darkness with sin-blinded eyes,\nThe light of the world is Jesus;\nGo, wash, at His bidding, and light will arise;\nThe light of the world is Jesus."]
