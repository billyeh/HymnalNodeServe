["1 O Head once full of bruises,\nSo full of pain and scorn,\nMid other sore abuses,\nMocked with a crown of thorn:\nO Head e'en now surrounded\nWith brightest majesty,\nIn death once bowed and wounded\nOn the accursed tree:", "2 Thou Countenance transcendent!\nThou life-creating Sun!\nTo worlds on Thee dependent-\nYet bruised and spit upon\nO Lord, what Thee tormented\nWas our sins' heavy load,\nWe had the debt augmented\nWhich Thou didst pay in blood.", "3 We give Thee thanks unfeigned,\nO Savior, Friend in need,\nFor what Thy soul sustained\nWhen Thou for us didst bleed.\nGrant us to lean unshaken\nUpon Thy faithfulness,\nUntil, to glory taken,\nWe see Thee face to face."]
