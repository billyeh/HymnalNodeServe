["1 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!\nSweetest Name on earth,\nHow can I, a sinner,\nCome to know its worth?", "2 Oh! the sinful sorrow,\nOh! the strangest shame,\nThat I saw no beauty\nIn that sacred Name.", "3 Never felt the sweetness!\nNever knew the grace,\nNever saw the love-pain\nIn that wounded face!", "4 Never found the mystery\nIn that simple word-\nJesus, Jesus, Jesus,\nSavior, Lover, Lord.", "5 Now 'tis past and over.\nGone my guilt and shame;\nJesus, Jesus did it,\nGlory to His Name!", "6 Wonderful compassion,\nReaching even me;\nBows my humbled spirit\nIn captivity.", "7 Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!\nLoved me in my shame.\nOh! the joy and rapture\nOf that sacred Name."]
