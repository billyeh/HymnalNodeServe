["1 He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater,\nHe sendeth more strength when the labors increase,\nTo added affliction He addeth His mercy,\nTo multiplied trials, His multiplied peace.", "2 When we have exhausted our store of endurance,\nWhen our strength has failed ere the day is half-done,\nWhen we reach the end of our hoarded resources,\nOur Father's full giving is only begun.", "3 His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,\nHis power no boundary known unto men,\nFor out of His infinite riches in Jesus,\nHe giveth and giveth and giveth again."]
