["1 From the north where God is dwelling\nComes a rushing, stormy gale.\nNow the mighty Spirit blowing\nAll our being does assail.\nWe are stirred to our foundations-\nHow this wind awakens us!\nThus we're open for God's dealings,\nAnd the cloud descends on us.", "2 With the cloud we have His presence\nSweetly hov'ring over us;\nSo enveloped by His nearness;\nIn the Lord we put our trust.\nBut the cloud brings with it fire\nTo consume our selfish lusts;\nThat as ashes something higher\nMay be added into us.", "3 Then from out the flashing fire\nComes th' electrum glowing bright.\nGod as gold and man as silver\nNow are mingled. What a sight!\nThis bright metal, O Lord Jesus,\nIs Thyself, Lamb-God sublime.\nO Lord, work Thyself within us\nTill th' electrum in us shines.", "4 By our passing through this cycle,\nLiving creatures we become\nTo express the life of Jesus;\nHe with whom we've been made one.\nWe express Him as a human,\nAs a man so good and fine;\nBalanced, normal, never striving;\nFully human, yet divine.", "5 We express Him as a lion\nConquering every enemy;\nAs an ox obedient, lowly,\nFaithful in His ministry.\nWe express Him as an eagle,\nSo transcendent, soaring high;\nNever held by fear or flatter,\nHe above it all does fly.", "6 Hallelujah! What a figure\nOf the way God deals with us!\nFrom the wind, cloud, fire, electrum,\nTo the creatures glorious:\nAs the man, the ox and lion,\nAs the eagle-all the four\nWill be our complete expression\nAs we eat Him more and more."]
