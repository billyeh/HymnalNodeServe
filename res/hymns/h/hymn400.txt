["1 Earthly pleasures vainly call me,\nI would be like Jesus;\nNothing worldly shall enthrall me,\nI would be like Jesus.", "chorus Be like Jesus, this my song,\nIn the home and in the throng;\nBe like Jesus, all day long!\nI would be like Jesus.", "2 He has broken every fetter,\nI would be like Jesus;\nThat my soul may serve Him better,\nI would be like Jesus.", "3 All the way from earth to glory,\nI would be like Jesus;\nTelling o'er and o'er the story,\nI would be like Jesus."]
