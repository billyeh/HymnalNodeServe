["1 Not where we elect to go,\nBut where Jesus leads the way,\nThere the living waters flow,\nThere our darkness turns to day.", "2 Not our self-appointed task\nWill the Lord's approval win,\nBut the work we did not ask,\nFinished humbly, just for Him.", "3 Not the prayer we long to plead\nWhen we bend before the Throne,\nBut the touching deeper need\nOf the Spirit's wordless groan.", "4 Not the gift we proudly lay\nOn His altar will He heed,\nIf our hearts have said Him, \"Nay,\"\nWhen He whispered, \"I have need.\"", "5 Thus we die, and dying live\nIn the heavenlies with the Lord;\nThus we serve, and pray, and give,\nChrist Himself our great Reward."]
