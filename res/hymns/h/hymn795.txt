["1 Father, let Thy kingdom come,\nLet it come with living power;\nSpeak at length the final word,\nUsher in the triumph hour.", "2 As it came in days of old,\nIn the deepest hearts of men,\nWhen Thy martyrs died for Thee,\nLet it come, O God, again.", "3 Tyrant thrones and idol shrines,\nLet them from their place be hurled;\nEnter on Thy better reign,\nWear the crown of this poor world.", "4 Oh, what long, sad years have gone,\nSince Thy Church was taught this prayer;\nOh, what eyes have watched and wept\nFor the dawning everywhere.", "5 Break, triumphant day of God!\nBreak at last our hearts to cheer;\nThrobbing souls and holy songs\nWait to hail Thy dawning here.", "6 Empires, temples, scepters, thrones,\nMay they all for God be won;\nAnd, in every human heart,\nFather, let Thy kingdom come."]
