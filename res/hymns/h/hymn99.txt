["1 'Tis midnight, and on Olive's brow\nThe star is dimmed that lately shone;\n'Tis midnight in the garden now,\nThe suff'ring Savior prays alone.", "2 'Tis midnight, and from all removed,\nThe Savior wrestles lone with fears-\nE'en that disciple whom He loved\nHeeds not his Master's grief and tears.", "3 'Tis midnight, and for other's guilt\nThe Man of Sorrows weeps in blood;\nYet He that hath in anguish knelt\nIs not forsaken by His God.", "4 'Tis midnight, and from ether-plains\nIs borne the song that angels know\nUnheard by mortals are the strains\nThat sweetly soothe the Savior's woe."]
