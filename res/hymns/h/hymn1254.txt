["1 This is the time for building the temple of the Lord\nThat all the local churches may fully be restored.\n'Tis not the time for our house while God's house lieth waste-\nO brothers, for God's building, rise up, make haste!", "chorus Be strong, be strong, God's dwelling place to build!\nThe Lord of hosts is with us, with His glory 'twill be filled!\nBe strong, be strong, and work in one accord,\nThat all the nations may behold the temple of the Lord.", "2 O hear, the Lord is speaking: \"Consider now your ways,\nYe sow and bring in little, for lacking is My praise.\nGo up into the mountain, material to provide,\nAnd build My house that I may be glorified.", "3 Ye who are priests, ye remnant of Christians now obey-\nThe Lord Himself is with us, whatever men may say,\nWith spirits stirred and burning, now let us come to work;\nMay none his part with others in building shirk.", "4 I'll fill this house with glory, the Lord of hosts has said,\nAnd the desire of nations will be exhibited.\nIts glory will be greater than all that's gone before,\nAnd we will share this glory forevermore."]
