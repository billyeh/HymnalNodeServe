["1 I lift my heart to Thee,\nSavior Divine,\nFor Thou art all to me,\nAnd I am Thine;\nIs there on earth a closer bond than this,\nThat my Beloved's mine, and I am His?", "2 Thine am I by all ties,\nAnd chiefly Thine,\nFor through Thy sacrifice\nThou, Lord, art mine;\nBy Thine own cords of love, so sweetly wound\nAround me, closely I to Thee am bound.", "3 To Thee, Thou Bleeding Lamb,\nI all things owe,\nAll that I have and am,\nAnd all I know;\nAll that I have is now no longer mine,\nAnd I am not my own: \"Lord, I am Thine.", "4 How can I, Lord, withhold\nLife's brightest hour\nFrom Thee; or gathered gold,\nOr any power?\nWhy should I keep one precious thing from Thee,\nWhen Thou hast given Thine own dear Self for me?", "5 I pray Thee, Savior, keep\nMe in Thy love,\nUntil the world Thou sweep\nAnd me remove\nTo that fair realm, where, sin and sorrow o'er,\nThou and Thine own are one for evermore."]
