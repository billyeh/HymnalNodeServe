["1 Father, 'twas Thy love that knew us\nEarth's foundation long before:\nThat same love to Jesus drew us\nBy its sweet constraining pow'r,\nAnd will keep us, and will keep us,\nSafely now, and evermore,\nSafely now, and evermore.", "2 Now that changeless love enfolds us,\nAll its wealth on us bestows;\nWhile its pow'r unchanging holds us\nIn a holy calm repose.\nGod and Father, God and Father,\nUnto Thee our worship flows,\nUnto Thee our worship flows.", "3 God of love, our souls adore Thee!\nWe would still Thy grace proclaim,\nTill we cast our crowns before Thee,\nAnd in glory praise Thy name;\nPraise and worship, praise and worship\nBe to God and to the Lamb!\nBe to God and to the Lamb!"]
