["1 There is a certain sense of life,\nWith life of every kind;\nAnd in th' eternal life in us,\nIt is a sense divine.", "2 The higher any life may be\nThe better is its sense;\nThe life divine the highest is,\nAnd has the highest sense.", "3 It is the sense of life in us\nIt is the sense of God;\n'Tis in our spirit made alive\nAnd more than sense of good.", "4 It is the inner sense in us\nThe inmost consciousness\nDiscerning matters inwardly\nGod's will to thus express.", "5 'Tis by this sense that God we know\nThe sense of inner life;\n'Tis pow'rful and spontaneous\nAnd not of any strife.", "6 The greater is our growth in life\nThe keener is this sense;\nThe more we walk and act in life\nThe more it is intense.", "7 The sense of life when exercised,\nWill make our spirit bold\nAnd by this inner sense of God,\nTrue fellowship we hold."]
