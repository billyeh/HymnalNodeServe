["1 The Church the vessel is to Christ\nHim to contain and Him express\nJust as the human body doth,\nMan's life show forth, his life possess.", "2 As was the temple to the ark\nReceptacle and resting-place;\nSo Christ the Church's content is\nAnd in the Church, Christ's dwelling-place.", "3 As Christ is God's true mystery\nGod to explain and God express;\nSo is the Church Christ's mystery\nChrist to explain and manifest.", "4 The members of the Church of Christ,\nAre all primarily of clay;\nThey need to be transformed and made,\nTransparent, precious day by day.", "5 By transformation they are built\nA vessel they to Christ afford;\nHis all-inclusiveness they hold;\nTransparent, they express the Lord.", "6 Thru all the transformation work,\nThe triune God performs in them\nThe Church a corporate vessel is,\nAnd like the new Jerusalem.", "7 How precious she in each respect\nTransparent too in every phase;\nChrist with God's fulness she contains\nChrist with God's glory she displays.", "8 With Christ as life, with God as light\nAnd with the Spirit's living flow\nThe triune God she manifests,\nFor all the universe to know."]
