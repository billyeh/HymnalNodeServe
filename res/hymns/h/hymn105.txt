["1 Himself He could not save,\nHe on the cross must die,\nOr mercy could not come\nTo ruined sinners nigh;\nYes, Christ, the Son of God, must bleed,\nThat sinners might from sin be freed.", "2 Himself He could not save,\nFor justice must be done;\nOur sins' full weight must fall\nUpon the sinless One;\nFor nothing less can God accept\nIn payment of that fearful debt.", "3 Himself He could not save,\nFor He the Surety stood\nFor all who now rely\nUpon His precious blood;\nHe bore the penalty of guilt\nWhen on the cross His blood was spilt.", "4 Himself He could not save,\nWhat wondrous love is this!\nIn love Himself He gave,\nThere ne'er was love like His!\nSuch love should melt a heart of stone,\nTill praise flows forth to Him alone!"]
