["1 The earth absorbs the soft, refreshing rain,\nAnd sends it back in flow'rs and fruits again;\nSo we receive Thy life so rich and free,\nAnd live it out for joy and praise to Thee.", "2 The moon receives the sun's bright, golden light,\nAnd gives it forth to cheer the darksome night;\nSo we receive the rays of light Divine,\nAnd with them on this darkened world we shine.", "3 'Tis by Thy love that I can love and bless\nThe foes who seek to blast my happiness;\nCan e'en rejoice, when bearing wrong and shame,\nThou deem'st me meet to suffer for Thy name.", "4 Naught but Thyself can satisfy my heart,\nConstrain my will from self and sin to part:\nIn love so great Thou giv'st Thyself to me;\nThat I may Thee express eternally."]
