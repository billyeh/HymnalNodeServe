["1 Lord, Thou art all the offerings,\nPrepared by God for us;\nThey are so rich in meaning\nSo sweet and glorious.\nThey have fulfilled God's purpose,\nAnd met His heart's desire;\nThey too have satisfied us\nAnd faced what we require.", "2 Thou art the burnt-oblation\nConsumed by holy fire;\nTo God as a sweet savor\nFulfilling His desire.\nThou walkedst in God's presence\nAnd all His will pursued;\nThyself the spotless offering\nFor us to God as food.", "3 Thou art the meal-oblation\nWith \"oil\" and \"frankincense\"\n'Tis holy, fine, and perfect\nAnd sweet to every sense.\nThou art the peace-oblation\nThe peace for us to make\nThat we with God may share Thee\nAs food of Thee partake.", "4 Thou art the sin-oblation\nFor us Thou sin wast made;\nBy death for our redemption,\nThe ransom Thou hast paid.\nThou art the trespass-offering\nThou all our sins didst bear,\nTo satisfy God's justice\nThat we His pardon share.", "5 Thou art the wave-oblation\nThe resurrected One;\nO'er hades, death and darkness\nThe vict'ry Thou hast won.\nThou art the heave-oblation\nThou didst ascend to God;\nAs such in heav'nly places,\nThou art our holy food."]
