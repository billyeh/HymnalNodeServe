["1 Do you know that you were chosen\nLong before the world began\nThat by God you were selected\nAnd appointed for His plan?\nSomething in your inmost being\nTells you this is surely true;\nThat's why you are in this meeting,\nAnd you feel the way you do.", "2 All the sins you've e'er committed,\nEverything you've ever done,\nAll by God has been forgiven\nTaken care of by God's Son.\nStruggle not, no; just believe this,\nFor His word assures it's true;\nAll you need to do is thank Him\nFor all that He's done for you.", "3 Did you know that all the Bible\nIs a will, a testament?\nEverything that Christ accomplished\nIs for all God's children meant.\nAs His child you are included,\nFor His word stands fast and true;\nSo by faith you now inherit\nAll that He has done for you.", "4 Did you know God has a family?\nYes, He does, in fact, it's us.\nThat's why we are here enjoying\nAll He is, so marvelous.\nHe's our God and we're His people,\nDay by day we love Him more;\nWe're so happy and so thankful,\nWe just praise Him o'er and o'er.", "5 All we know is that we love Him,\nWe're so glad for what He's done;\nWe are brought to Him, and we all\nKnow the joy of being one.\nWe're so glad that we're included,\nWhat a fellowship have we!\nSo we'd like to welcome you, friend,\nInto God's own family."]
