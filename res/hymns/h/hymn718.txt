["1 Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?\nThe blood of Jesus whispers peace within.", "2 Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?\nTo do the will of Jesus-this is rest.", "3 Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging round?\nOn Jesus' bosom naught but calm is found.", "4 Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?\nIn Jesus' keeping we are safe, and they.", "5 Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?\nJesus we know, and He is on the throne."]
