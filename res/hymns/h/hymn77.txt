["1 Lift that Name high! That glorious Name,\nLet heav'n and earth its pow'r proclaim;\nOur mighty, conqu'ring, coming King,\nEarth yet shall with His praises ring.", "2 Lift that Name high! To that high tower\nWe flee in every trial hour,\nSafe, sheltered, satisfied and free,\nFor Jesus' Name is victory.", "3 Lift that Name high! Until one day\nHis mighty Name the earth shall sway,\nAnd sin and death, distress and pain\nShall be no more, for Christ shall reign.", "4 Lift that Name high! Jesus shall reign,\nAnd kings shall follow in His train;\nLift that Name high, all names above,\nThe Name of Him we own and love.", "5 Lift that Name high! For every knee\nShall bow to Him; Jesus shall see\nFruit of His Cross, when earth shall bring\nHer tribute to her Lord and King."]
