["1 Around Thy table, holy Lord,\nIn fellowship we meet,\nObedient to Thy gracious word,\nThis feast of love to eat.", "2 Here every one that loves Thy name,\nOur willing hearts embrace;\nOur source of life and hope the same,\nAll debtors to Thy grace.", "3 Commune with each at this blest hour,\nThy peace, Thy joy impart;\nThy thoughts of love, of truth, of pow'r,\nImpress upon each heart."]
