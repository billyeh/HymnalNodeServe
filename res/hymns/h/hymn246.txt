["1 Joys are flowing like a river,\nSince the Comforter has come;\nHe abides with us forever,\nMakes the trusting heart His home.", "chorus Blessed quietness, holy quietness-\nWhat assurance in my soul!\nOn the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.\nHow the billows cease to roll!", "2 Bringing life and health and gladness\nAll around, this heavenly Guest\nBanished unbelief and sadness,\nChanged our weariness to rest.", "3 Like the rain that falls from heaven,\nLike the sunlight from the sky,\nSo the Holy Ghost is given,\nComing to us from on high.", "4 See a fruitful field is growing\nBlessed fruits of righteousness,\nAnd the streams of life are flowing\nIn the lonely wilderness.", "5 What a wonderful salvation\nWhere we always see His face!\nWhat a perfect habitation!\nWhat a quiet resting place!"]
