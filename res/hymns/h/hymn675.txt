["1 God moves in a mysterious way\nHis wonders to perform:\nHe plants His footsteps in the sea,\nAnd rides upon the storm.", "2 Deep in unfathomable mines\nOf never-failing skill,\nHe treasures up His bright designs,\nAnd works His sovereign will.", "3 Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;\nThe clouds ye so much dread\nAre big with mercy, and shall break\nIn blessings on your head.", "4 Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,\nBut trust Him for His grace;\nBehind a frowning providence\nHe hides a smiling face.", "5 His purposes will ripen fast,\nUnfolding every hour:\nThe bud may have a bitter taste,\nBut sweet will be the flower.", "6 Blind unbelief is sure to err,\nAnd scan His work in vain;\nGod is His own Interpreter,\nAnd He will make it plain."]
