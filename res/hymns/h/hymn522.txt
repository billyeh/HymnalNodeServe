["1 O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found,\nAnd found in Thee alone,\nThe peace, the joy I sought so long,\nThe bliss till now unknown.", "chorus Now none but Christ can satisfy,\nNone other name for me;\nThere's love and life and lasting joy,\nLord Jesus, found in Thee.", "2 I sighed for rest and happiness,\nI yearned for them, not Thee;\nBut, while I passed my Savior by,\nHis love laid hold on me.", "3 I tried the broken cisterns, Lord,\nBut, ah, the waters failed!\nE'en as I stooped to drink they fled,\nAnd mocked me as I wailed.", "4 The pleasures lost I sadly mourned,\nBut never wept for Thee,\nTill grace the sightless eyes received,\nThy loveliness to see."]
