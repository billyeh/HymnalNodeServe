["1 Under an eastern sky,\nAmid a rabble's cry,\nA Man went forth to die,\nFor me! for me!", "2 Thorn-crowned His blessed head,\nBlood-stained His every tread;\nCross-laden He was led,\nFor me! for me!", "3 Pierced His hands and feet,\nThree hours o'er Him beat\nFierce rays of noon-tide heat,\nFor me! for me!", "4 Thus wert Thou made all mine;\nLord, make me wholly Thine;\nGrant grace and strength divine\nTo me! to me!", "5 In thought and word and deed,\nThy will to do, O lead\nMy soul, e'en though it bleed,\nTo Thee, to Thee."]
