["1 I would commune with Thee, my God;\nE'en to Thy seat I come;\nI leave my joys, I leave my sins,\nAnd seek in Thee my home.", "2 I stand upon the mount of God,\nWith sunlight in my soul;\nI see the storms in vales beneath,\nI hear the thunder's roll.", "3 But I am calm with Thee, my God,\nBeneath these glorious skies;\nAnd to the height on which I stand\nNor storms nor clouds can rise.", "4 Oh, this is life! oh, this is joy,\nMy God, to find Thee so;\nThy face to see, Thy voice to hear,\nAnd all Thy love to know.\nnote: \"(Repeat the last line of each stanza)"]
