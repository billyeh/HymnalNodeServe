["1 Fight, saints, for Jesus our Lord!\nTake in His life, stand in one accord!\nNever fear God's enemy;\nTread on his head triumphantly!\nPray that the daily church life be strong,\nThat all the saints in spirit press on,\nFighting as the one new man,\nFulfilling our Lord's great plan!\n(Glory! Hallelujah!)"]
