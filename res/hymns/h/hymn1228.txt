["1 The Bible is the Word of God,\nIts message is but one-\nChrist and the church, His holy Bride,\nThe two becoming one.", "chorus Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!\nOh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside\nThat we may now prepare to meet Him in the air\nAnd ever in our Bridegroom's love abide.", "2 The Father is the mighty God,\nHis purpose is but one-\nTo find a Bride for Christ the Lord\nAnd give her to His Son.", "3 The Son is Jesus Christ the Lord,\nHis heart desire's but one-\nTo have a loving counterpart,\nA Bride He's wooed and won.", "4 The Spirit is but Christ Himself,\nHe is the Lord applied\nTo generate the men of earth,\nTransform them as His Bride.", "5 The living Word is Jesus too,\nGod-breathed as life to us,\nThat we be wholly sanctified,\nA Bride all-glorious."]
