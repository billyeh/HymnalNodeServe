["1 Pass me not, O gentle Savior,\nHear my humble cry;\nWhile on others Thou art calling,\nDo not pass me by.", "chorus Savior, Savior,\nHear my humble cry;\nWhile on others Thou art calling,\nDo not pass me by.", "2 Let me at Thy throne of mercy\nFind a sweet relief;\nKneeling there in deep contrition,\nHelp my unbelief.", "3 Trusting only in Thy merit,\nWould I seek Thy face;\nHeal my wounded, broken spirit,\nSave me by Thy grace.", "4 Thou the spring of all my comfort,\nMore than life to me;\nWhom have I on earth beside Thee?\nWhom in heaven but Thee?"]
