["1 Of Jesus' love that sought me,\nWhen I was lost in sin;\nOf wondrous grace that brought me\nBack to His fold again;\nOf heights and depths of mercy,\nFar deeper than the sea,\nAnd higher than the heavens,\nMy theme shall ever be.", "chorus Sweeter as the years go by,\nSweeter as the years go by;\nRicher, fuller, deeper,\nJesus' love is sweeter,\nSweeter as the years go by.", "2 He trod in old Judea\nLife's pathway long ago;\nThe people thronged about Him,\nHis saving grace to know.\nHe healed the broken-hearted,\nAnd caused the blind to see;\nAnd still His great heart yearneth\nIn love for even me."]
