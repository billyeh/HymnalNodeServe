["1 Thou art fairer than the morning,\nO my Savior and my King!\nOf Thy grandeur and Thy beauty,\nHow my soul delights to sing.", "chorus Thou art fairer than the morning,\nThou art brighter, brighter than the day;\nAt the glory of Thy presence\nClouds and darkness flee away.", "2 Clothed in light as with a garment,\nCrowned with majesty divine,\nLo, the scepter of dominion\nNow and ever, Lord, is Thine.", "3 O the greatness of Thy mercy,\nAnd the richness of Thy grace!\nO the love that in Thy kingdom\nIs preparing me a place!", "4 When at last I reach the kingdom,\nWin the crown, the battle o'er,\nWith ten thousand times ten thousand\nI shall sing forevermore."]
