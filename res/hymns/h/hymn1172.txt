["1 Lo, the conflict of the ages\nIs upon us today,\nAnd the forces of rebellion\nAre in total array.\nThe humanity of Jesus\nNow the saints must possess,\nHis true image and dominion\nOn the earth to express.", "chorus Let us stand up in Jesus\nIn His full human life,\nHuman virtues prevailing\n'Gainst corruption so rife;\nIn this wickedness concerted,\nIn this age perverse, perverted,\nThe humanity of Jesus\nMust the church now display.", "2 Lo, how Satan came to damage\nHuman life on the earth;\nBut the Lord in all this ruin\nRaised a man full of worth!\nFrom the seed of the woman\nGod incarnate became\nThe man Jesus-the last Adam-\nTo destroy Satan's aim!", "3 It's by calling, drinking, eating\nThe man Jesus today,\nHis humanity enjoying\nBruises Satan each day.\nTo the Lord we must be turning,\nAll our soul life deny,\nTo destroy all Satan's working\nAnd the new man supply.", "4 See the ruin of a nation\nGoing downward in sin;\nAll humanity is fallen\nAnd corrupted within.\nBut as children of the kingdom\nWe are salting the earth;\nHis humanity preserves us\nIn the midst of such dearth."]
