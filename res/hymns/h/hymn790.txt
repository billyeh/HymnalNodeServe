["1 \"Keep the incense burning\"\nOn the altar fire;\nLet thy heart's petition,\nLet thy deep desire,\nBe a cloud of incense\nWreathing God's own throne,\nTill His will among us\nShall be fully done.", "2 \"Keep the incense burning\"\nOn the altar fire;\nFeed the flame, Lord Jesus,\nTill Thy whole desire\nShall in us, Thy children,\nFind free course, and be\nBreathed through lips anointed\nFor this ministry.", "3 \"Keep the incense burning\"\nThough thy faith be weak;\nThough in words thou canst not\nAll thy longing speak;\nSilent heart-petitions,\nSpirit-taught, will be\nGloriously answered;\nWrought by God for thee.", "4 \"Keep the incense burning,\"\nHourly let it rise,\nTill from opened heavens,\nTill from flame-swept skies,\nFire shall fall and kindle\nAll hearts to a flame;\nMaking us a glory\nTo our Savior's name."]
