["1 Oh, tame me, Lord! rebellious nature calm,\nOh, tame me, Lord!\nThis heart, so tossed and filled with wild alarm,\nOh, tame me, Lord!\nThese human longings, let them end in Thee,\nAnd let me be Thy bondslave, even me!", "2 I will not ask Thee to account to me\nFor aught Thou dost;\nFor crosses sore, or paths I cannot see:\nBut I will trust.\nNo second causes shall perplex my soul,\nOr stay from yielding all to Thy control.", "3 The raging storm I dare not fight alone,\nAh, show Thy face!\nSay, \"It is I!\" Thyself to me make known,\nAh, show Thy face!\nThen what care I for darkest depths of woe?\nThine arms, O Christ, shall fold me close, I know!", "4 Oh, save me, Lord! Subdue this stubborn will;\nOh, save me, Lord!\nIn spite of all, Thy purposes fulfil\nIn me, Oh, Lord;\nI yield my self, and all I have and am,\nTo follow Thee, Thou all redeeming Lamb!", "5 How can I fear? Thou art so near to me;\nHow can I fear?\nI hear Thee say, \"Believe, and thou shalt see!\"\nHow can I fear?\nI now believe, and trust Thy mighty power,\nTo save, to heal, to keep this very hour!"]
