["1 What we are, we're His image;\nWe're created in His image,\nTo express the Christ, subdue the earth,\nThe purpose of our second birth,\nWe're His image, glorious!", "2 What we are, we're the called ones,\nWe've been called into the purpose.\nNo longer low in Adam's fall,\nGod's glory is our holy call.\nWe're the called ones, glorious!", "3 What we are, we're the joint-heirs;\nWe inherit full salvation.\nWe overcome and share His throne.\nAll things today we fully own.\nWe're the joint-heirs, glorious!", "4 What we are, we're Christ's partners:\nWe share the same anointing.\nNo longer we're just serving Him;\nHis riches we may all share in.\nWe're His partners, glorious!", "5 What we are, we're the brothers.\nWe are all the holy brothers.\nThe life of Christ we did obtain,\nFor holiness the gold we gain.\nHoly brothers, glorious!", "6 What we are, we're the lampstand;\nWe're the shining forth of Jesus.\nIn this world's darkness, sin, and strife,\nWe're holding Christ, the light of life.\nWe're the lampstand, glorious."]
