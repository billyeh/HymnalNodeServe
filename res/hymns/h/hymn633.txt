["1 And wouldst thou live on earth as \"more than conqu'ror\"?\nVictorious o'er the worldly life around?\nMark well the pathway that thy Lord hath trodden,\nSince here alone the secret can be found.", "2 He died, and by His death He dealt the death-blow\nTo sin and Satan's power for evermore,\nAnd they, who die with Him, shall rise victorious,\nAnd \"in this sign\" shall triumph more and more.", "3 The Cross henceforth their mark of perfect freedom,\nWhat can they lose, who have surrendered all?\nWhat can they fear, who have no reputation?\nWhat shall they shrink from, when His voice doth call?", "4 \"In this sign,\" therefore, go henceforth and conquer,\nFinding the place of death the gate of life,\n\"Life more abundant,\" life in all its fulness,\nIn the deep calm of God, set free from strife."]
