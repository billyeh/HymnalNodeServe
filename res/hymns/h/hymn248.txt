["1 Fainting in the desert,\nIsrael's thousands stand\nAt the rock of Kadesh.\nHark! the Lord's command,\nSpeak to the Rock,\nBid the waters flow,\nStrike not its bosom\nOpened long ago.\nSpeak to the Rock,\nTill the waters flow.", "chorus Speak to the Rock,\nBid the waters flow,\nDoubt not the Spirit,\nGiven long ago;\nTake what He waiteth,\nFreely to bestow,\nDrink till its fulness\nAll Thy being know.", "2 Blessed Rock of Ages,\nThou art open still;\nThy blest Holy Spirit\nAll our being fill;\nStill Thou dost say,\nWherefore struggle so?\nCall for the Spirit,\nWhisper soft and low,\nSpeak to the Rock\nBid the waters flow.", "3 Oh, for trust more simple,\nFully to believe;\nOh, for hearts more childlike,\nFreely to receive;\nE'en as a babe,\nOn its mother's breast,\nSo on Thy bosom\nLet my spirit rest,\nFilled with Thy life,\nWith Thy blessing blest."]
