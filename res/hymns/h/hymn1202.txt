["1 God in His justifying has a plan,\nA deeper purpose for a corporate man.\nWhen we were called, this mighty Lord of all\nAppeared to us to save us from the fall.", "2 We walked as strangers unaware of Him,\nBut in His glory God shined deep within,\nInfusing His own element in us;\nThis precious essence was our Lord Jesus.", "3 What glory! How attractive was this light!\nHow we appreciated such a sight!\nOur first reaction was belief in Him-\nThis precious God has placed Himself within.", "4 Our first reflection of this element\nReflected Jesus back to God, Who sent\nHis own response to count as righteousness\nOur faith in Him Who was infused in us.", "5 But we would hold to this reality,\nOur Jesus Christ in us our all to be,\nEnjoying all He is abundantly,\nContent to have this One eternally.", "6 Thus God could never be so satisfied;\nKnowing that we cared only to abide\nIn our experiences of His Son,\nNot caring for His goal to make us one.", "7 Still He would seek those faithful saints who'd hear\nHis call to give up everything so dear,\nTo offer up their individual Christ;\nTo come together for the Body life."]
