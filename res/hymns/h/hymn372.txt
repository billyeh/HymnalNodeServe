["1 Nothing between my soul and the Savior,\nNaught of this world's delusive dream;\nI have renounced all sinful pleasure;\nJesus is mine, there's nothing between.", "chorus Nothing between my soul and the Savior,\nSo that His blessed face may be seen;\nNothing preventing the least of His favor,\nKeep the way clear! Let nothing between.", "2 Nothing between, like worldly pleasure;\nHabits of life, though harmless they seem,\nMust not my heart from Him e'er sever;\nHe is my all, there's nothing between.", "3 Nothing between, like pride or station;\nSelf-life or friends shall not intervene;\nThough it may cost me much tribulation,\nI am resolved; there's nothing between.", "4 Nothing between, e'en many hard trials,\nThough the whole world against me convene;\nWatching with prayer and much self-denial,\nI'll triumph at last, with nothing between."]
