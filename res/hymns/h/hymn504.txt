["1 Jesus, I live to Thee,\nThe Loveliest and Best;\nMy life in Thee, Thy life in me,\nIn Thy blest love I rest.", "2 Jesus, I die to Thee,\nWhenever death shall come;\nTo die in Thee is life to me,\nWith Thee I'm ever one!", "3 Whether to live or die,\nI know not which is best;\nTo live in Thee is bliss to me,\nTo die is endless rest.", "4 Living or dying, Lord,\nI ask but to be Thine;\nMy life in Thee, Thy life in me,\nMakes Thee forever mine."]
