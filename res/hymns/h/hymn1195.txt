["1 Life is mysterious, life is God Himself,\nWhose whole intention focuses on man.\nGod made him to take in the tree of life,\nTo have a man of life for His own plan.", "2 But man was tempted and seduced to sin,\nBy taking knowledge from the other source.\nThis man then fell as knowledge entered in\nAnd dominated him with all its force.", "3 This knowledge has developed in the man\nInto the human culture on the earth.\nSo man, created to fulfill God's plan,\nBecame a failure full of Satan's dearth.", "4 Then God came in the Person of the Son;\nLived He on earth, Christ Jesus was His name-\nA living model so that everyone\nCould live by life, God's fullness to obtain.", "5 This God-man, Christ, went to the cross and died,\nBy death He ended knowledge, the old man.\nThings negative forever crucified,\nDeath He subdued, a new life He began!", "6 From death He resurrected and became\nThe living Spirit to give life to us.\nWhen we believe and call upon His name;\nThis living Spirit comes to dwell in us.", "7 By this the very Triune God is now\nThe living Spirit mingling deep within.\nOur spirit joins in oneness; this is how\nWe are one spirit evermore with Him.", "8 'Tis by this Spirit that we walk and act,\nWe have our being, think, and see all things;\nWe're now within this Spirit! What a fact!\nThis Spirit to us all God's fullness brings!", "9 So now we have to set our mind on Him;\nEach day, each hour, our mind on Him must be;\nThat by this Spirit we'd be saved within\nBy life and reign in life eternally.", "10 'Tis by this Spirit that we shall be freed\nFrom Sin whose law inside us death would bring.\nOur mortal bodies will have life indeed;\nThus sanctified we'll be in everything.", "11 This Spirit shall transform our natural life,\nSave us from self, build us in one new man,\nTill we're conformed to be like Jesus Christ,\nThus finishing our God's eternal plan.", "12 Life is our God and life is Christ our Lord.\nLife is the Spirit. Life's the only way-\nTill we're transfigured and redeemed to God.\nWe're waiting, looking forward to that day!"]
