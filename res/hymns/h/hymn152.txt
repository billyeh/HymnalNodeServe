["1 O how deep and how far-reaching,\nIs Thy love, dear Lord, to me!\nFar beyond my pow'r to fathom\nDeeper than the deepest sea!\nIt has caused Thee death to suffer,\nAnd to me Thyself impart\nThat in Thee I might be grafted,\nAnd become of Thee a part.", "2 Who can tell of all the wonders,\nWhich Thy love for me has wrought\nYet the greatest of these wonders,\nIs that Thou to me art brought.\nOh! to me Thy love has given,\nAll Thou art as my supply;\nAs true life I now may share Thee,\nAnd Thy riches e'er enjoy.", "3 Lord, Thy love is the expression,\nOf Thy loving self divine\nMaking life so full of meaning\nHarmonized with God's design.\nGrace of life, how all-sufficient\nIs my portion day by day;\nI'm the object of Thy favor,\nAnd Thy sweetness taste alway.", "4 What from Thee can separate me?\nThou wilt love me to the end!\nOh! Thy love is so prevailing\nE'en Thyself with me to blend!\nWe two one will be for ever;\nI am Thine and Thou art mine!\nThis will be my testimony:\nIn Thy love we'll ever twine!"]
