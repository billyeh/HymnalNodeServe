["1 Search me, O God, my actions try,\nAnd let my life appear\nAs seen by Thine all-searching eye-\nTo mine my ways make clear.", "2 Search all my sense, and know my heart\nWho only canst make known,\nAnd let the deep, the hidden part\nTo me be fully shown.", "3 Throw light into the darkened cells,\nWhere passion reigns within;\nQuicken my conscience till it feels\nThe loathsomeness of sin.", "4 Search all my thoughts, the secret springs,\nThe motives that control;\nThe chambers where polluted things\nHold empire o'er the soul.", "5 Search, till Thy fiery glance has cast\nIts holy light through all,\nAnd I by grace am brought at last\nBefore Thy face to fall.", "6 Thus prostrate I shall learn of Thee,\nWhat now I feebly prove,\nThat God alone in Christ can be\nUnutterable love."]
