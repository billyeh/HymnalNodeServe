["1 The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want;\nHe makes me down to lie\nIn pastures green; He leadeth me\nThe quiet waters by.", "2 My soul He doth restore again,\nAnd me to walk doth make\nWithin the paths of righteousness,\nE'en for His own name's sake.", "3 Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,\nYet will I fear no ill;\nFor Thou art with me, and Thy rod\nAnd staff me comfort still.", "4 My table Thou hast furnished\nIn presence of my foes;\nMy head Thou dost with oil anoint,\nAnd my cup overflows.", "5 Goodness and mercy all my life\nShall surely follow me,\nAnd in God's house forevermore\nMy dwelling-place shall be."]
