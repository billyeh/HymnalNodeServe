["1 There is no love like the love of Jesus,\nNever to fade or fall,\nTill into the rest of the house of God\nHe has gathered us all.", "chorus Jesus' love, precious love,\nBoundless, and pure, and free;\nOh, turn to that love, weary wand'ring soul;\nJesus pleadeth for thee.", "2 There is no heart like the heart of Jesus,\nFilled with a tender love;\nNo throb nor throe that our hearts can know;\nBut He feels it above.", "3 There is no eye like the eye of Jesus,\nPiercing so far away;\nNe'er out of the sight of its tender light\nCan the wanderer stray.", "4 There is no voice like the voice of Jesus,\nTender and sweet its chime;\nLike musical ring of a flowing spring\nIn the bright summertime.", "5 Oh, let us hark to the voice of Jesus!\nThen we shall never roam;\nAnd we shall rest on His loving breast,\nAnd with Him we'll be one!"]
