["1 A mind at perfect peace with God;\nO what a word is this!\nA sinner reconciled through blood;\nThis, this indeed is peace.", "2 By nature and by practice far,\nHow very far from God;\nYet now by grace brought nigh to Him,\nThrough faith in Jesus' blood.", "3 So nigh, so very nigh to God,\nI cannot nearer be;\nFor in the person of His Son\nI am as near as He.", "4 So dear, so very dear to God,\nMore dear I cannot be;\nThe love wherewith He loves the Son,\nSuch is His love to me.", "5 Why should I ever anxious be,\nSince such a God is mine?\nHe watches o'er me night and day,\nAnd tells me \"Mine is thine.\""]
