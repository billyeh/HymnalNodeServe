["1 The Lord has been revealed in us,\nThe kingdom-seed so glorious;\nHe's planted deeper than our heart,\nAnd from us He will ne'er depart.\nThis seed is never satisfied\nJust in our spirits to abide;\nHe wants to grow and spread today\nTo live in us in every way.", "2 We're like a glove, an empty man,\nSo meaningless without a hand;\nLord, saturate each inward part\nAnd form Yourself in all our heart.\nThe Lord must spread into our mind,\nOur natural thoughts and concepts bind;\nImaginations, dreams be gone,\nThe kingdom-seed in us is sown!", "3 In our emotions He must grow;\nRaw, fragile feelings overthrow;\nOur love, our hatred, must be His-\nLord, we agree with You for this.\nAnother part the Lord must fill-\nOur hard, unbending, stubborn will;\nLord, our resistance quickly break,\nSubdue us for Thy kingdom's sake.", "4 Our conscience too the Lord must clear,\nThat we may walk in godly fear;\nOur conscience must be keen today,\nElse we cannot the Lord obey.\n'Tis by His growing, spreading thus,\nThe Lord will have His home in us;\nA place on earth where He is Lord,\nFull rights to Him we will afford."]
