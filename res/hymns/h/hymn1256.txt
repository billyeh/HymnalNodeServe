["1 Praise the Lord, we're in the Lord's recovery-\nHome at last, here in the church.\nPraise the Lord, we're in the new creation-\nOne new man, the end of our search.\nWith the saints, builded, coordinated;\nNo more I, forever \"we.\"\nWe are one in the Son, standing here till He comes;\nYes, nothing can stop our God till He's done!"]
