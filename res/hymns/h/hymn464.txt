["1 My glorious Victor, Prince Divine,\nClasp these surrendered hands in Thine;\nAt length my will is all Thine own,\nGlad vassal of a Savior's throne.", "2 My Master, lead me to Thy door;\nPierce this now willing ear once more;\nThy bonds are freedom; let me stay\nWith Thee, to toil, endure, obey.", "3 Yes, ear and hand, and thought and will,\nUse all in Thy dear slav'ry still!\nSelf's weary liberties I cast\nBeneath Thy feet; there keep them fast.", "4 Tread them still down; and then I know,\nThese hands shall with Thy gifts o'erflow;\nAnd pierced ears shall hear the tone\nWhich tells me Thou and I are one."]
