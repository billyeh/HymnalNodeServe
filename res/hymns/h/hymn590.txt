["1 Lo, from vessels, earthen only,\nShining forth in ceaseless grace,\nReaching weary hearts, and lonely,\nBeams the light from Jesus' face!", "2 Christ, the light that fills the heavens\nShining forth on earth beneath,\nThrough His Spirit freely given\nLight of life 'midst shades of death;", "3 Down from heaven's unclouded glory\nGod Himself the treasure brought,\nClosing thus His love's sweet story\nWith His sweetest, deepest thought.", "4 Earthen vessels, marred, unsightly,\nBut the treasure as of old,\nFresh from glory, gleaming brightly,\nHeaven's undimmed, unchanging gold.", "5 Vessels, broken, frail, yet bearing\nThrough the hungry ages on\nRiches giv'n with hand unsparing-\nGod's great Gift, His precious Son!"]
