["1 Lord Jesus, are we one with Thee?\nO height, O depth of love!\nThou one with us on Calvary,\nWe one with Thee above.", "2 Such was Thy grace that for our sake\nThou didst from heaven come down,\nWith us of flesh and blood partake,\nIn all our misery one.", "3 Our sins, our guilt, in love Divine\nConfessed and borne by Thee;\nThe gall, the curse, the wrath were Thine,\nTo set Thy members free.", "4 Ascended now, in glory bright,\nHead of the Church Thou art;\nNor life nor death, nor depth nor height,\nThy saints and Thee can part.", "5 Oh teach us, Lord, to know and own\nThis wondrous mystery,\nThat Thou in heaven with us art one,\nAnd we are one with Thee.", "6 Soon, soon shall come that glorious day\nWhen, seated on Thy throne,\nThou shalt to wondering worlds display\nThat Thou with us art one."]
