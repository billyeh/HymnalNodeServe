["1 Jesus is our lovely Bridegroom,\nAnd our Bridegroom is with us!\nNow our praying's turned to praising\nIn His Presence glorious.", "chorus O our Bridegroom! O our Bridegroom!\nLord, Thou art our Bridegroom sweet!\nHow we treasure Thy dear presence-\nO what bliss and joy complete!", "2 We are fellows of the Bridegroom\nAnd our fasting days have ceased.\nWith the Bridegroom in His chamber,\nJoyfully we keep the feast.", "3 We as virgins may enjoy Him,\nVirgins simple, single, chaste.\nGoing forth to meet the Bridegroom,\nOut from all the world we haste.", "4 We are guests by God invited\nTo His Son's great wedding feast.\nBrothers, sisters, hallelujah,\nFrom religion we're released!", "5 Now rejoice with joy excelling,\nJoy of joys, all else beside-\nNot just fellows, guests, or virgins,\nHallelujah, we're the Bride!", "chorus Hallelujah! Hallelujah!\nLord, Thou art our Bridegroom sweet!\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nO what bliss and joy complete!"]
