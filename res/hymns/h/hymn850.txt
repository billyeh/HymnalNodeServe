["1 O Lord, we have loved her fair beauty,\nThe house Thou hast chosen for Thee,\nThe courts where Thy gladness rejoiceth,\nAnd where Thou delightest to be.\nWe love to be made the fair dwelling\nWhere God in His grace may abide;\nWe'd cast forth whatever may grieve Thee,\nAnd welcome none other beside.", "2 O blessed the grace that has made us\nThe home of the gladness of God,\nThe dwelling wherein Thou delightest,\nThe house Thou hast bought with Thy blood.\n'Tis there that Thy joy overfloweth,\nWe feel it, we take of it there;\nBy all that Thou workest within us,\nThy temple is holy and fair.", "3 The secret of that inner chamber,\nThy place is of heavenly rest;\nThe stillness of thoughts that adore Thee,\nThe shrine that Thou lovest the best.\nThe temple where Christ hath His dwelling\nThe souls He hath ransomed, forgiv'n;\nThe temple where I have my dwelling,\nIs Christ in the glory of heav'n."]
