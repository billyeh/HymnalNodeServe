["1 Grace! 'tis a charming sound,\nHarmonious to the ear;\nHeav'n with the echo shall resound,\nAnd all the earth shall hear.", "chorus All sufficient grace!\nNever powerless!\nIt is Christ who lives in me,\nIn His exhaustlessness.", "2 'Twas grace that wrote my name\nIn life's eternal book;\n'Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb,\nWho all my sorrows took.", "3 Grace taught my wandering feet\nTo tread the pilgrim road;\nAnd new supplies each hour I meet\nWhile pressing on to God.", "4 Grace taught my heart to pray,\nAnd made my eyes o'erflow;\n'Tis grace which kept me to this day,\nAnd will not let me go.", "5 Grace all the work shall crown\nThrough everlasting days;\nIt lays in love the topmost stone,\nAnd well deserves the praise.", "6 Oh, let that grace inspire\nMy heart with strength divine;\nMay all my powers to Thee aspire,\nAnd all my days be Thine."]
