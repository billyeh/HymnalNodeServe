["1 Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,\nSowing in the noontide and the dewy eve;\nWaiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping,\nWe shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.", "chorus Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,\nWe shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves;\nBringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,\nWe shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.", "2 Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,\nFearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze;\nBy and by, the harvest and the labor ended,\nWe shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.", "3 Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master,\nTho', the loss sustained, our spirit often grieves;\nWhen our weeping's over, He will bid us welcome,\nWe shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves."]
