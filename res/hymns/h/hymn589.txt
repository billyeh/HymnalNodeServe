["1 God in heaven hath a treasure,\nRiches none may count or tell;\nHath a deep eternal pleasure,\nChrist the Son, He loveth well.\nGod hath here on earth a treasure,\nNone but He its price may know-\nDeep, unfathomable pleasure,\nChrist revealed in saints below.", "2 God in tongues of fire descending,\nChosen vessels thus to fill\nWith the treasure never ending,\nEver spent-unfailing still.\nGod's own hand the vessel filling\nFrom the glory far above,\nLonging hearts forever stilling\nWith the riches of His love.", "3 Thus though worn, and tried, and tempted,\nGlorious calling, saint, is thine;\nLet the Lord but find thee emptied,\nLiving branch in Christ the Vine!\nVessels of the world's despising,\nVessels weak and poor and base,\nBearing wealth God's heart is prizing,\nGlory from Christ's blessed face.", "4 Oh to be but emptier, lowlier,\nMean, unnoticed-and unknown,\nAnd to God a vessel holier,\nFilled with Christ and Christ alone!\nNaught of earth to cloud the glory,\nNaught of self the light to dim,\nTelling forth His wondrous story,\nEmptied to be filled with Him."]
