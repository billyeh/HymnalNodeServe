["1 Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son,\nEndless is the vict'ry Thou o'er death hast won;\nAngels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,\nKept the folded grave-clothes, where Thy body lay.", "chorus Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son,\nEndless is the vict'ry Thou o'er death hast won.", "2 Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb;\nLovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom;\nLet the Church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing,\nFor her Lord now liveth, death hath lost its sting."]
