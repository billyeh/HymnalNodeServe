["1 I love, I love my Master,\nI will not go out free,\nFor He is my Redeemer;\nHe paid the price for me.\nI would not leave His service,\nIt is so sweet and blest;\nAnd in the weariest moments\nHe gives the truest rest.", "2 My Master shed His life-blood\nMy vassal life to win,\nAnd save me from the bondage\nOf tyrant self and sin.\nHe chose me for His service,\nAnd gave me power to choose\nThat blessed, perfect freedom,\nWhich I shall never lose.", "3 I would not halve my service,\nHis only it must be!\nHis only, who so loved me,\nAnd gave Himself for me.\nRejoicing and adoring,\nHenceforth my song shall be,\nI love, I love my Master,\nI will not go out free."]
