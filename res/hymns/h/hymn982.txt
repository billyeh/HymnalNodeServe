["1 How true it is no heart may comprehend\nThe glory God prepareth for His own,\nAnd what will happen when this age shall end;\nBut yet in vision Jesus hath made known\nHow fair and holy shall the Church descend,\nLit up with light of precious jasper stone.", "2 And He shall make His Church all heavenly fair,\nWith gold and pearls, and every radiant stone,\nAnd reign in holiness and glory there,\nAnd shine as suns and stars have never shone;\nAnd He shall lead His Bride, His joy and care,\nWith blissful singing to His Father's throne.", "3 And then the blest communion shall have come,\nOf God's dear children meeting from afar;\nWithin His burning love they blend as one,\nYet each, according as His counsels are,\nShall have peculiar glory of his own,\nAs one star differeth from another star.", "4 And God is all in all in that great day,\nAnd He is their exceeding great Reward;\nTheir stream of life, their beautiful array,\nTheir food, their joy, their radiance, Christ the Lord;\nThe music of their wondrous song shall say,\nHow great the joy that passeth thought or word.", "5 And this is that eternal life of heaven,\nLaid up with Christ in God, the mystery\nOf resurrection life which He hath given:\nA fount of living waters full and free;\nA life by which the gates of death are riven,\nA life which on the throne of Christ shall be.", "6 And here in this waste wilderness begun,\nSo soon as we believe in Christ aright,\nAnd quickened by the Spirit of the Son,\nReceive Him as our only life and light,\nAs all the branches in the vine are one,\nSo we are one forever in His sight.", "7 Now come, Lord Jesus, quickly from above,\nDo Thou sustain us on the desert road,\nAnd draw us after Thee by might of love,\nOur Fatherland art Thou, O love of God;\nOnce safe in Thee, no more shall we remove,\nO Thou our everlasting sure abode."]
