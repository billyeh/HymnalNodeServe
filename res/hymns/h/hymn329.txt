["1 Blessed be God, our God,\nWho gave for us His well-beloved Son,\nThe gift of gifts, all other gifts in one;\nBlessed be God, our God!", "2 What will He not bestow!\nWho freely gave this mighty gift unbought,\nUnmerited, unheeded, and unsought,\nWhat will He not bestow?", "3 He spared not His Son!\n'Tis this that silences each rising fear,\n'Tis this that bids the hard thought disappear;\nHe spared not His Son!", "4 Who shall condemn us now?\nSince Christ has died, and ris'n, and gone above,\nFor us to plead at the right hand of Love;\nWho shall condemn us now?", "5 'Tis God that justifies!\nWho shall recall His pardon or His grace?\nOr who the broken chain of guilt replace?\n'Tis God that justifies!", "6 The victory is ours!\nFor us in might came forth the mighty One;\nFor us He fought the fight, the triumph won:\nThe victory is ours!"]
