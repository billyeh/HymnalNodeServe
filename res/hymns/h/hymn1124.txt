["1 What! Not sing of blood divine?\nWhat! Not tell to all mankind?\nWhat! Not speak to hearts unclean\nOf the precious living stream.", "2 By this blood, God's life released,\nBlood surpassing any beast's;\nPerfect, spotless Lamb of God,\nIncorruptible His blood.", "3 Voice it has, this holy blood;\nPow'r possessed to speak with God;\nSpeaks it for us at the throne\nWith its glorious virtue shown.", "4 Failure on our conscience is-\nConscience means a \"knowing this\"-\nCausing us much grief and pain,\nTelling us of every stain.", "5 All the while we're unaware\nOf the blood's effectual prayer.\nJesus' blood speaks of our case,\nThat we might receive His grace!", "6 We need not dead works to bring,\nNor another offering.\nNothing else could please our God,\nHeav'n is listening for His blood.", "7 In His blood forgiveness shines;\nOh, 'tis glorious to find!\nIsrael just atonement knew,\nWe have that and cleansing too.", "8 Heart and mind are now at peace\nRest! Our conscience has been reached.\nNever more we blush in shame,\nWe are washed from every stain.", "9 Hallelujah! Fathomless!\nAll that's in His blood for us!\nSing we will, and sing we must;\nIn His blood is all our trust!"]
