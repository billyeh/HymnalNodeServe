["1 Under the burdens of guilt and care,\nMany a spirit is grieving,\nWho in the joy of the Lord might share,\nLife everlasting receiving.", "chorus Life! life! eternal life!\nJesus alone is the Giver:\nLife! life! abundant life!\nGlory to Jesus forever!", "2 Burdened one, why will you longer bear\nSorrows from which He releases?\nOpen your heart, and rejoicing, share\nLife more abundant in Jesus.", "3 Leaving the mountain, the streamlet grows,\nFlooding the vale with a river;\nSo, from the hill of the Cross, there flows\nLife more abundant forever.", "4 Oh, for the flood on the thirsty land!\nOh, for a mighty revival!\nOh, for a sanctified, fearless band,\nReady to hail its arrival!"]
