["1 O surely I will not come in\nWithin my house to stay,\nNor yet give sleep unto my eyes,\nTill Jesus has His way.\nUpon the earth, the Lord desires\nA place where He may live;\nFor this, Thy habitation, Lord,\nMyself I fully give.", "2 We heard of it while yet far off,\nWe found it in the way;\nWe then came up into her courts,\nAnd here we'll ever stay.\nArise, O Lord, into Thy rest,\nThou and Thy ark so strong.\nThy priests are clothed with righteousness;\nThy saints with joy and song.", "3 The Lord has sworn in truth to us,\nHe will not turn away-\nHis Seed shall sit with Him enthroned,\nAnd reign with Him for aye.\nThe Lord hath found a place to dwell,\nHath chosen Zion fair;\nHis habitation it will be,\nIt is His rest fore'er.", "4 Her food abundant He will bless,\nHer needy, satisfy;\nAnd with salvation clothe her priests,\nAnd all her want supply.\nThe horn of David's budding here,\nA lamp for earth's dark night.\nHis enemies are clothed with shame,\nHis saints with crowns of light.", "5 And now within these latter days,\nAmidst earth's dark unrest,\nGod's house is being built again\nAnd all His people blessed.\nSecure within the local church,\nWith saints in one accord\nWe meet to just release our praise,\nAnd thus enjoy the Lord."]
