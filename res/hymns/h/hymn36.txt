["1 We praise Thee, glorious Father,\nAs objects of Thy grace,\nWho for Thine own heart's pleasure\nAre now before Thy face:\nThy sons marked out for glory\nKnown from eternity\nWith Christ Thy Well-beloved,\nObject supreme to Thee.", "2 Who else but Thee, O Father,\nCould in Thine only Son\nSo bless us with Thy Spirit,\nAnd have us for Thine own?\nSoon shall we be forever\nWith Christ in glory; then\nWe'll shine in His blest image\nEternally, Amen!"]
