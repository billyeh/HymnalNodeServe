["1 Go, labor on; spend, and be spent;\nThy joy to do the Father's will;\nIt is the way the Master went;\nShould not the servant tread it still?", "2 Go, labor on: \"'tis not for nought;\nThy earthly loss is heav'nly gain;\nMen heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;\nThe Master praises, what are men?", "3 Go, labor on; your hands are weak,\nYour knees are faint, your souls cast down;\nYet falter not; the prize you seek\nIs near, a kingdom and a crown.", "4 Go, labor on while it is day,\nThe world's dark night is hastening on;\nSpeed, speed thy work, cast sloth away,\nIt is not thus that souls are won.", "5 Men die in darkness at your side,\nWithout a hope to cheer the tomb;\nTake up the torch and wave it wide,\nThe torch that lights time's thickest gloom.", "6 Press on, faint not, keep watch and pray;\nBe wise the erring soul to win;\nGo forth into the world's highway,\nCompel the wanderer to come in.", "7 Press on, and in thy work rejoice;\nFor work comes rest, the prize thus won;\nSoon shalt thou hear the Master's voice,\nThe midnight cry, Behold, I come!"]
