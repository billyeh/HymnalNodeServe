["1 Nearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee;\nE'en though it be a cross\nThat raiseth me,\nStill all my song shall be\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee.", "2 Though, like a wanderer,\nThe sun gone down,\nDarkness comes over me,\nMy rest a stone;\nYet in my dreams I'd be\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee.", "3 There let me see the sight,\nAn open heaven;\nAll that Thou sendest me,\nIn mercy given;\nAngels to beckon me\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee.", "4 Then, with my waking thoughts\nBright with Thy praise,\nOut of my stony griefs\nBethel I'll raise,\nSo by my woes to be\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee."]
