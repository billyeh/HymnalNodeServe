["1 How pleasant and how good it is\nWhen brethren in the Lord\nIn one another's joy delight\nAnd dwell in sweet accord.", "2 Such oneness, like anointing oil\nOn head to body poured;\nSuch oneness, like the morning dew,\nWith sweet refreshment stored.", "3 To those who dwell in brotherhood\nThe Lord His blessing sends,\nHe crowns them with the bliss of life,\nOf life that never ends."]
