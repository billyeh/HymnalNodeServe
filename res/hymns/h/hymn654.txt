["1 \"Be all at rest, my soul!\" Oh! blessed secret\nOf the true life that glorifies thy Lord;\nNot always doth the busiest soul best serve Him,\nBut he who resteth on His faithful word.", "2 \"Be all at rest!\" for rest is highest service;\nTo the still heart God doth His secrets tell;\nThus shalt thou learn to wait, and watch, and labor,\nStrengthened to bear, since Christ in thee doth dwell.", "3 \"Be all at rest!\" for rest alone becometh\nThe soul that casts on Him its every care;\n\"Be all at rest!\" so shall thy life proclaim Him\nA God who worketh and who heareth prayer.", "4 \"Be all at rest!\" so shalt thou be an answer\nTo those who question, \"Who is God, and where?\"\nFor God is rest, and where He dwells is stillness,\nAnd they who dwell in Him that rest shall share."]
