["1 There is a name to Jesus given,\nHis matchless love its accents tell;\nFor it declares: \"He is my Brother,\nAnd this His name-Emmanuel!\nThe Lord, by angels worshiped yonder,\nHas stooped to earth with men to dwell,\nIncarnate God, and man forever-\nOur own beloved Emmanuel.", "2 There is a name that's still more precious,\nThat stirs our hearts with fondest love:\nIt is the charming name of Jesus,\nThe name all other names above.\nIt tells me that He is my Savior\nFrom sin and sickness and the grave.\nI love the precious name of Jesus,\nFor I am one He came to save!", "3 Though dear to us the name of Jesus,\nThe name of Christ is higher still!\nIt tells of Him who dwells within us,\nOur old heart to renew and fill.\nIt tells me of the Spirit's fullness,\nIt brings the pow'r of Pentecost.\nO blessed Christ, anoint me also,\nAnd fill me with the Holy Ghost!"]
