["1 Burning, burning, we are burning,\nEver to our spirits turning,\nOne for Thine eternal purpose,\nin spirit one;\nOn the ground of locality,\nWe express our unity-\nMany members, but one Body,\nChrist as our Head.", "chorus Christ and the local church,\nChrist and the local church,\nChrist and the church,\nOur reality and life,\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nLord, we've given our lives to You,\nFor the building of Your Body,\nFor our building up in love.", "2 Breathing, breathing, we are breathing,\nWith each breath new life receiving,\nWhat a transformation from the old\nto the new;\nBreathing out the old life from us,\nBreathing in new life and oneness,\nWe are breathing in of Jesus, we are\nbreathing in of life."]
