["1 Something every heart is loving:\nIf not Jesus, none can rest;\nLord, my heart to Thee is given;\nTake it, for it loves Thee best.", "2 Thus I cast the world behind me;\nJesus most beloved shall be;\nBeauteous more than all things beauteous,\nHe alone is joy to me.", "3 Bright with all eternal radiance\nIs the glory of Thy face;\nThou art loving, sweet, and tender,\nFull of pity, full of grace.", "4 When I hated, Thou didst love me,\nShedd'st for me Thy precious blood;\nStill Thou lovest, lovest ever,\nShall I not love Thee, my God?", "5 Keep my heart still faithful to Thee,\nThat my earthly life may be\nBut a shadow to that glory\nof my hidden life in Thee."]
