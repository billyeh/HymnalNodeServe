["1 O my Savior, glorified!\nNow the heavens, opened wide,\nShow to faith's exultant eye\nOne in beauteous majesty.", "2 Worthy of the sweetest praise\nThat my ransomed heart can raise,\nIs that Man in whom alone\nGod Himself is fully known.", "3 For those clust'ring glories prove\nThat glad gospel, \"God is Love,\"\nWhilst those wounds, in glory bright.\nVoice the solemn, \"God is Light.\"", "4 Hark, my soul! thy Savior sings;\nCatch the joy that music brings,\nAnd, with that sweet flood of song,\nPour thy whisp'ring praise along.", "5 O my Savior, glorified,\nTurn my eye from all beside,\nLet me but Thy beauty see,\nOther light is dark to me."]
