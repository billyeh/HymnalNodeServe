["1 \"Ask in faith,\" the Name of Jesus\nAll your plea before the throne;\nAs you trust, the Lord will whisper,\n\"See, my child, the work is done.\"", "2 \"Ask in faith,\" God waits to answer\nEach petition, Spirit-wrought;\nHe will work in wondrous power,\nFar beyond your highest thought.", "3 \"Ask in faith,\" 'tis just the asking,\nIn a faith that dares to stand,\nFull of joyful expectation,\nWith an open, outstretched hand.", "4 \"Ask in faith,\" for God is waiting\nFor thy faith-filled, earnest prayer.\nFaith delights Him; faith can touch Him,\nEvery moment, everywhere."]
