["1 Glory be to Jesus,\nWho in bitter pains\nPoured for me the life-blood\nFrom His sacred veins.", "2 Grace and life eternal\nIn that Blood I find;\nBlest be His compassion,\nInfinitely kind.", "3 Blest through endless ages\nBe the precious stream,\nWhich from endless torments\nDid the world redeem.", "4 Abel's blood for vengeance\nPleaded to the skies;\nBut the blood of Jesus\nFor our pardon cries.", "5 It the conscience sprinkles,\nFrees our guilty hearts;\nSatan in confusion\nTerror-struck departs.", "6 Oft as earth exulting\nWafts its praise on high,\nAngel-hosts rejoicing\nMake their glad reply.", "7 Lift ye then your voices;\nSwell the mighty flood;\nLouder still and louder\nPraise the precious blood."]
