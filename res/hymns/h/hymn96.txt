["1 My song is love unknown,\nMy Savior's love to me;\nLove to the loveless shown,\nThat they might lovely be.\nO who am I,\nThat for my sake\nMy Lord should take\nFrail flesh, and die?", "2 He came from His blest throne\nSalvation to bestow;\nBut men made strange, and none\nThe longed-for Christ would know:\nBut oh, my Friend,\nMy Friend indeed,\nWho at my need\nHis life did spend.", "3 Sometimes they strew His way,\nAnd His sweet praises sing;\nResounding all the day\nHosannas to their King:\nThen \"Crucify!\"\nIs all their breath,\nAnd for His death\nThey thirst and cry.", "4 They rise and needs will have\nMy dear Lord made away;\nA murderer they save,\nThe Prince of life they slay.\nYet cheerful He\nTo suffering goes,\nThat He His foes\nFrom thence might free.", "5 In life, no house, no home\nMy Lord on earth might have;\nIn death, no friendly tomb,\nBut what a stranger gave.\nWhat may I say?\nHeav'n was His home;\nBut mine the tomb\nWherein He lay.", "6 Here might I stay and sing,\nNo story so divine;\nNever was love, dear King,\nNever was grief like Thine.\nThis is my Friend,\nIn whose sweet praise\nI all my days\nCould gladly spend."]
