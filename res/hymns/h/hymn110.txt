["1 O solemn hour! O hour alone,\nIn solitary night,\nWhen God the Father's only Son,\nAs Man, for sinners lost, undone,\nExpires-amazing sight!\nThe Lord of glory crucified!\nThe Lord of Life has bled and died!", "2 O mystery of mysteries!\nOf life and death the tree!\nCenter of two eternities,\nWhich look with rapt, adoring eyes,\nOnward, and back to Thee'\nO cross of Christ, where all His pain\nAnd death is our eternal gain.", "3 O how our inmost hearts do move,\nWhile gazing on that cross!\nThe death of the incarnate Love!\nWhat shame, what grief, what joy we prove,\nThat He should die for us!\nOur hearts were broken by that cry,\n\"Eli, lama sabachthani!\"", "4 Worthy of death, O Lord, we were;\nThat vengeance was our due;\nIn grace Thou, spotless Lamb, didst bear\nThyself our sins, and guilt, and fear;\nJustice our Surety slew.\nWith Thee, our Surety, we have died;\nWith Thee, we there were crucified.", "5 Quickened with Thee with life divine,\nRaised with Thee from the dead;\nThine Own, now human and divine,\nShall with Thee in Thy glories shine,\nThe Church's living Head!\nWe, who were worthy but to die,\nNow with Thee, \"Abba Father,\" cry."]
