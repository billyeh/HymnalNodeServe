["1 God created us His vessels,\nHis expression to achieve;\nThus He made a heart to love Him,\nAnd a spirit to receive.", "2 With our heart we have to love Him\nWith our spirit Him possess,\nAs our life, of Him partaking\nThat Himself we may express.", "3 Satan has our heart corrupted\nTo our spirit death did give\nThat the Lord we should not contact,\nBut by self attempt to live.", "4 Thus the Lord in His salvation,\nHeart and spirit has renewed,\nTo recover our receiving,\nAnd our loving aptitude.", "5 It is by our heart's renewal,\nWe may God in love pursue\nAnd in newness of the spirit,\nWe may contact God anew.", "6 Ever true and pure and single,\nTo the Lord our heart must be\nPoor in spirit, ever seeking,\nGod to contact constantly.", "7 Keep our heart, Lord, in love's freshness\nAnd our spirit strengthen more\nThat in newness of the spirit,\nWe may touch Thee o'er and o'er."]
