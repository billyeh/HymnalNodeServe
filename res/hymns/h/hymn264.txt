["1 Jesus, Thine all-victorious love\nShed in my soul abroad;\nThen shall my heart no longer rove,\nRooted and fixed in God,\nRooted and fixed in God.", "2 Oh, that in me the sacred fire\nMight now begin to glow;\nBurn up the dross of base desire,\nAnd make the mountains flow,\nAnd make the mountains flow.", "3 He, who at Pentecost didst fall,\nMay He my sins consume;\nThy Holy Ghost, for Him I call;\nThy burning Spirit, come,\nThy burning Spirit, come.", "4 Refining fire, go through my heart,\nIlluminate my soul;\nScatter Thy life through every part,\nAnd sanctify the whole,\nAnd sanctify the whole.", "5 My steadfast soul, from falling free,\nShall then no longer move,\nWhile Christ is all the world to me,\nAnd all my heart is love,\nAnd all my heart is love."]
