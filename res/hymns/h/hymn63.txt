["1 Praise to the Holiest in the height,\nAnd in the depth be praise:\nIn all His words most wonderful;\nMost sure in all His ways.", "2 O loving wisdom of our God,\nWhen all was sin and shame,\nHe, the last Adam, to the fight\nAnd to the rescue came.", "3 O wisest love! that flesh and blood\nWhich did in Adam fail,\nShould strive afresh against the foe,\nShould strive and should prevail.", "4 And that a higher gift than grace\nShould flesh and blood refine,\nGod's presence, and His very self\nAnd essence all-divine.", "5 O generous love! that He, who smote\nIn man for man the foe,\nThe double agony in man\nFor man should undergo.", "6 And in the garden secretly,\nAnd on the cross on high,\nShould teach His brethren, and inspire\nTo suffer and to die.", "7 Praise to the Holiest in the height,\nAnd in the depth be praise:\nIn all His words most wonderful;\nMost sure in all His ways."]
