["1 Christ, from whom all blessings flow,\nPerfecting the saints below,\nHear us, who Thy nature share,\nWho Thy mystic body are.", "2 Join us, in one spirit join,\nLet us still receive of Thine;\nStill for more on Thee we call,\nThou who fillest all in all.", "3 Move, and actuate, and guide:\nDivers gifts to each divide;\nPlaced according to Thy will,\nLet us all our work fulfil.", "4 Sweetly may we all agree,\nTouched with loving sympathy;\nKindly for each other care,\nEvery member feel its share.", "5 Love, like death, hath all destroyed,\nRendered all distinctions void;\nNames, and sects, and parties fall:\nThou, O Christ, art all in all."]
