["1 Laboring on Jesus, the good land so real,\nPlowing and planting and watering the field.\nHe yields the produce of reality,\nGod reaps a harvest of Jesus in me.", "chorus O Jesus! You're God's good land\nFor me to labor on!\nI'll bit by bit possess You\nUntil the whole is won!\nWith Canaan is God's purpose,\nThe labor He will bless;\nLord Jesus, here I gain Yourself,\nYour Person to possess.", "2 Laboring on Jesus! My heart has been set,\nLabor's begun, and I have no regret,\nFor with my labor God's sending the rain,\nAnd all my labor on Christ yields much gain.", "3 Laboring on Jesus this practical way-\nPraying His Word in the spirit each day,\nFoll'wing His living anointing within,\nBuilt up with others, the church life to win.", "4 Laboring on Jesus yields reality,\nMeetings of fullness for all men to see;\nThere God and man are indeed satisfied,\nAnd there God's presence cannot be denied.", "5 Labor on Jesus to have Him increased!\nThen seek God's dwelling and come to the feast!\nThere bring and offer your surplus to God,\nThere eat the riches, rejoice in the Lord!"]
