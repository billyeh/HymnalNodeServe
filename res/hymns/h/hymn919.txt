["1 He shall reign o'er all the earth,\nHe who wore the crown of thorn,\nWhom they deemed of little worth,\nWhom they met with hate and scorn;\nSend the tidings forth, that all\nHumbly at His feet may fall.", "2 Long His heritage hath lain\n'Neath the false usurper's sway;\nHe will claim it back again,\nRout the foes and win the day.\nSend the tidings forth, that all\nHumbly at His feet may fall.", "3 Then, beneath His rule of peace\nHeaven shall smile, and earth shall sing,\nEver yielding rich increase\nTo the honor of her King.\nSend the tidings forth, that all\nHumbly at His feet may fall.", "4 Hasten, Lord, the wondrous hour,\nBid it strike from shore to shore,\nThine the kingdom and the power,\nThine the glory evermore.\nBow each rebel heart, that all\nAt Thy feet adoring fall."]
