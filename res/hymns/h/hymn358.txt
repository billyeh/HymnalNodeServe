["1 Love Divine, all love excelling,\nJoy of heav'n, to earth come down;\nFix in us Thy humble dwelling,\nAll Thy faithful mercies crown.\nJesus, Thou art all compassion;\nPure, unbounded love Thou art;\nVisit us with Thy salvation,\nEnter every trembling heart.", "2 Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit\nInto every troubled breast;\nLet us all in Thee inherit,\nLet us find the promised rest.\nTake away the love of sinning;\nAlpha and Omega be;\nEnd of faith, as its beginning,\nSet our hearts at liberty.", "3 Come, Almighty, to deliver,\nLet us all Thy life receive;\nMay Thy presence e'er be with us,\nNever more Thy temples leave.\nThee we would be always blessing,\nServe Thee as Thou wouldst approve,\nPray, and praise Thee without ceasing,\nGlory in Thy perfect love.", "4 Finish, then, Thy new creation;\nPure and spotless let us be;\nLet us see Thy great salvation\nPerfectly restored in Thee;\nChanged from glory into glory\nTill with Thee we take our place,\nTill we cast our crowns before Thee,\nLost in wonder, love and praise."]
