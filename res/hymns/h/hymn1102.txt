["1 The Lord said unto my Lord,\n\"Sit Thou at My right hand;\nThy foes shall be Thy footstool,\nUpon them Thou shalt stand.\"\nThe sceptre of Thy strength shall\nThe Lord from Zion send\nTo rule o'er all the nations\nForever 'til the end.", "2 A voluntary offering,\nThe young ones are to Thee;\nIn consecration's splendor\nHow beautiful to see!\nFor as the dew of morning\nRefreshes all the land-\nThe young ones given to Thee\nAre precious in Thy hand.", "3 The Lord hath sworn forever\nAnd never will turn back,\n\"Thou art a priest forever,\nAs was Melchizedek.\"\nOh, Thou hast no beginning\nOf days; of life: \"no end!\nAnd on Thine intercession\nWe ever do depend.", "4 The Lord is at Thy right hand\nAnd in His day of wrath\nHe'll strike through rulers, judging\nThe nations in His path.\nWhile riding on to triumph\nHe'll drink of us, the stream,\nHis head uplifted, strengthened,\nThe whole earth to redeem.", "5 Oh Lord, Thou art ascended\nTo God's right hand to sit;\nAs Head o'er all things, to Thee\nGod doth Thy foes commit.\nOur King-for us Thou reignest,\nOur Priest-we are supplied,\nOur all we give unto Thee,\nThou Conqueror glorified."]
