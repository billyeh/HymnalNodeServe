["1 The law of God is holy, good\nTo practise good it doth command;\nIts purpose is to clearly show,\nThat we cannot meet God's demand.", "2 Yet in our mind there is a law,\nWhich always tries the good to do;\nBut in our members is a law,\nWhich always doth this law subdue.", "3 The law within our mind is good\n'Tis of our human life obtained,\nAt our creation from the Lord\nThat good behavior be maintained.", "4 The law within our members is,\nThe evil of satanic life;\nInto our members at the fall,\nIt came thru Satan's subtle strife.", "5 This evil law of Satan is,\nThe law of sin, in us its seat;\n'Tis stronger than the law of good,\nAnd always brings it to defeat.", "6 But in our spirit is a law\nWhich is the Spirit's law of life;\n'Tis of the very life of God,\nWhich we from our rebirth derive.", "7 This law divine the strongest is\nTranscending all the others o'er;\nFrom sin's law freeing, it fulfills,\nThe full requirement of God's law.", "8 We then must always set our mind,\nUpon the spirit deep within\nAnd not upon the things of flesh\nThe body ruined by the sin.", "9 To set the mind upon the flesh,\nIs sin and death and darkest night;\nThe mind upon the spirit set,\nIs life and peace and full of light.", "10 This is the way of true release!\nThis is the way of victory!\nLord, may we in the spirit live\nAnd by the Spirit walk with Thee."]
