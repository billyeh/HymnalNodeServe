["1 Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!\nThe Christ who's all within me lives.\nWith Him I have been crucified;\nThis glorious fact to me He gives.\nNow it's no longer I that live\nBut Christ the Lord within me lives.", "2 Oh, what a joy! Oh, what a rest!\nChrist now is being formed in me.\nHis very nature and life divine,\nIn my whole being inwrought shall be.\nAll that I am came to an end\nAnd all of Christ is all to me.", "3 Oh, what a thought! Oh, what a boast!\nChrist shall in me be magnified.\nIn nothing shall I be ashamed\nFor He in all shall be applied.\nIn woe or blessing, death or life\nThrough me shall Christ be testified.", "4 Oh, what a prize! Oh, what a gain!\nChrist is the goal toward which I press.\nNothing I treasure, nor aught desire\nBut Christ of all-inclusiveness.\nMy hope, my glory, and my crown,\nIs Christ, the One of peerlessness.\n(Repeat the last two lines of each stanza)"]
