["1 O God, our help in ages past,\nOur hope for years to come,\nOur shelter from the stormy blast,\nAnd our eternal home.", "2 Under the shadow of Thy throne\nThy saints have dwelt secure;\nSufficient is Thine arm alone,\nAnd our defence is sure.", "3 Before the hills in order stood,\nOr earth received her frame,\nFrom everlasting Thou art God,\nTo endless years the same.", "4 A thousand ages in Thy sight\nAre like an evening gone;\nShort as the watch that ends the night\nBefore the rising sun.", "5 Time, like an ever-rolling stream,\nBears all its sons away;\nThey fly forgotten, as a dream\nDies at the opening day.", "6 O God, our help in ages past,\nOur hope for years to come,\nBe Thou our guard while life shall last,\nAnd our eternal home."]
