["1 The Spirit of life is within us today\nWho's likened to water our thirst to allay;\nOf Him we may drink and be filled thus with Him\nUntil as a river He flows from within.", "2 The Spirit of pow'r comes upon us today\nWho's likened to clothing ourselves to array;\nIn Him we are baptized, with Him we are dressed\nFor service equipping with power possessed.", "3 The Spirit of life is as breath glorious\nAs spirit of life it is breathed into us;\nThe Spirit of pow'r doth the wind typify\nWhich bloweth upon us with pow'r from on high.", "4 Into His disciples the risen Lord breathed\nThe Spirit of life thus to them He bequeathed;\nTh' ascended Lord poured at the Pentecost hour,\nUpon His disciples the Spirit of pow'r.", "5 The Spirit of life is within as the life\nThe Spirit of power is giv'n for this life;\nAs blowing of wind- brings the fresh air to breathe\nThe Spirit of power to life doth bequeath.", "6 These are not two spirits apart and afar\nBut of the one Spirit the two functions are\nTo clothe us with God and to fill us within\nThat we may be thoroughly mingled with Him.", "7 Lord, fill with Thy Spirit of life every part\nThat we may grow up in Thy life as Thou art;\nAnd clothe us without with Thy Spirit of pow'r,\nThy will to fulfill in Thy service each hour."]
