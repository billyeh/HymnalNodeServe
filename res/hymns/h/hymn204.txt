["1 Gathered in Thy name, Lord Jesus,\nLosing sight of all but Thee,\nO what joy Thy presence gives us,\nCalling up our hearts to Thee!", "2 Loved with love which knows no measure,\nSave the Father's love to Thee,\nBlessed Lord, our hearts would treasure\nAll the Father's thoughts of Thee.", "3 All His joy, His rest, His pleasure-\nAll His deep delight in Thee-\nLord, Thy heart alone can measure\nWhat Thy Father found in Thee.", "4 How He set His love upon Thee-\nCalled Thee His beloved Son;\nYet for us He did not spare Thee,\nBy Thy death our life was won.", "5 O the joy, the wondrous singing,\nWhen we see Thee as Thou art!\nThy blest name, Lord Jesus, bringing\nSweetest music to God's heart.", "6 Notes of gladness, songs unceasing,\nHymns of everlasting praise,\nPsalms of glory, joy increasing,\nThrough God's endless day of days."]
