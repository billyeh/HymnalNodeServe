["1 I saw great throngs-each was a brother dear,\nLinked with each other in one Body here;\nEach in close union with the living Head,\nThe witness-folk, by Jesus' Spirit led.", "2 At every time, in every clime I found\nThose, not with words to Christ, but Spirit bound.\nHe strengthens them with might each day, each hour;\nThrough them true works divine are wrought in power.", "3 This is the Church the Spirit hath begot,\nElect from every people, Christ their lot.\nThey follow where His shepherd-staff doth lead;\nThe members of this host are blessed indeed.", "4 And when on earth they meet His death to show,\nTo Him their vows of love they oft renew.\nSome little flock will gather there or here;\nChrist, Head of all, to every soul most near.", "5 This is the temple which our Lord approves,\nThe Church which truly honors Him and loves,\nWhose sacrifice is on the altar bound;\nShe soon in glory will His throne surround."]
