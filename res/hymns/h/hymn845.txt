["1 Release my spirit! This is what I need:\nO may my spirit with the saints' be knit;\nNo more in private ways Thyself to seek\nBut freed from self and for Thy building fit.", "2 Release my spirit! This is what I ask\nThat self-confined or closed I may not be;\nHow deep within myself I long have been\nIf Thou deliver not, I'll ne'er be free.", "3 Release my spirit! 'Tis for this I pray\nThat from myself I fully may come forth;\nThy Spirit then through me may freely flow\nAnd Thou Thy presence fully may show forth.", "4 Release my spirit! This is what I want\nThat I from my seclusion may depart;\nMy private seeking poverty has brought\nNow save from self, Thy wealth to me impart.\n,", "5 Release my spirit! This is what I seek\nThat prisoned in my self no more I'll be;\nBy Satan's cunning cheated nevermore\nBut loosed from self to Thine infinity.", "6 Release my spirit! 'Tis for this I yearn\nThat self may bind my spirit nevermore;\nWith all the saints I'd mingle in Thy life\nAnd all Thou art enjoy forevermore."]
