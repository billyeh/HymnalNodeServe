["1 If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,\nWere my life worth living for a day?\nCould my yearning heart find rest and comfort\nIn the things that soon must pass away?\nIf I gained the world, but lost the Savior,\nWould my gain be worth the lifelong strife?\nAre all earthly pleasures worth comparing\nFor a moment with a Christ-filled life?", "2 Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,\nAnd a name revered both far and near,\nYet no hope beyond, no harbor waiting,\nWhere my storm-tossed vessel I could steer;\nIf I gained the world, but lost the Savior,\nWho endured the cross and died for me,\nCould then all the world afford a refuge,\nWhither, in my anguish, I might flee?", "3 O what emptiness!-without the Savior\n'Mid the sins and sorrows here below!\nAnd eternity, how dark without Him!\nOnly night and tears and endless woe!\nWhat, though I might live without the Savior,\nWhen I come to die, how would it be?\nO to face the valley's gloom without Him!\nAnd without Him all eternity!", "4 O the joy of having all in Jesus!\nWhat a balm the broken heart to heal!\nNe'er a sin so great, but He'll forgive it,\nNor a sorrow that He does not feel!\nIf I have but Jesus, only Jesus,\nNothing else in all the world beside-\nO then everything is mine in Jesus;\nFor my needs and more He will provide."]
