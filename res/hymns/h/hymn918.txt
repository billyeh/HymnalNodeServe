["1 Christians, make haste, your mission high fulfilling,\nTo tell to all the world that God is Light,\nThat He who made all nations is not willing\nOne soul should perish, lost in shades of night.", "chorus Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;\nTidings of Jesus, redemption and release.", "2 Behold how many thousands still are lying,\nBound in the darksome prison-house of sin,\nWith none to tell them of the Savior's dying\nOr of the life He died for them to win.", "3 'Tis yours to save from peril of perdition\nThe soul for whom the Lord His life laid down;\nBeware lest, slothful to fulfill your mission,\nYou lose one jewel that should deck His crown.", "4 Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation\nThat God, in whom they move and live, is love;\nTell how He stooped to save His lost creation,\nAnd died on earth that men He might approve.", "5 Give of your sons to bear the message glorious;\nGive of your wealth to speed them on their way;\nPour out your soul for them in prayer victorious,\nAnd all you spend our Savior will repay.", "6 He comes again; O brothers, ere you meet Him,\nMake known to every heart His saving grace;\nLet none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,\nThrough your neglect unfit to see His face."]
