["1 Beneath the cross of Jesus\nI fain would take my stand,\nThe shadow of a mighty Rock\nWithin a weary land;\nA home within the wilderness,\nA rest upon the way,\nFrom the burning of the noontide heat,\nAnd the burden of the day.", "2 Oh, safe and happy shelter!\nOh, refuge tried and sweet!\nOh, trysting place where heaven's love\nAnd heaven's justice meet.\nAs to the holy patriarch\nThat wondrous dream was given,\nSo is my Savior by the cross\nA ladder up to heaven.", "3 There lies beneath its shadow,\nBut on the farther side,\nThe darkness of an awful grave\nThat gapes both deep and wide;\nAnd there between us stands the cross,\nTwo arms outstretched to save,\nLike a watchman set to guard the way\nFrom that eternal grave.", "4 Upon that cross of Jesus\nMine eye at times can see\nThe very dying form of One,\nWho suffered there for me;\nAnd from my smitten heart, with tears,\nTwo wonders I confess,\nThe wonders of His glorious love,\nAnd my own worthlessness.", "5 I take, O cross, thy shadow\nFor my abiding place;\nI ask no other sunshine than\nThe sunshine of His face;\nContent to let the world go by,\nTo know no gain nor loss,\nMy sinful self my only shame,\nMy glory all the cross."]
