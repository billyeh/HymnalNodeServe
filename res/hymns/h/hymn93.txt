["1 Lord, we treasure with affection\nAll Thy path of sorrow here,\nAnd those closing scenes of anguish\nTo our hearts Thyself endear.", "chorus Praise Thee, Savior! Praise Thee, Savior!\nPraise Thee, Lord, for sinners slain!\nGive Thee glory! Give Thee glory!\nGive Thee glory for the life we gain!", "2 Deep Thy sorrow then, Lord Jesus,\nDeeper far than thought can reach;\nGrief intense and suff'rings holy,\nFar beyond all tongues to teach.", "3 None could follow there, blest Savior,\nWhen redemption's work was done;\nFor those suff'rings, deep, unfathomed,\nWere, Lord Jesus, Thine alone!", "4 Thou didst measure then sin's distance,\nDarkness, wrath and curse were Thine;\nMan-betrayed, by God forsaken;\nThus we learn Thy love divine!"]
