["1 Christ is the Word and Spirit too\nAnd as the Spirit in the Word;\nAnd all the words He speaks to us,\nAre life and spirit thus conferred.", "2 The Holy Word we have without\nThe Holy Spirit is within;\nThe greatest gifts divine are these\nThat we may God enjoy therein.", "3 The Word the Spirit doth express\nThe Spirit its reality;\nThey're but two aspects of one thing,\nAnd should not separated be.", "4 Whene'er the Spirit lights the Word,\nThe Word becometh life to us;\nWhen Word from Spirit is divorced\n'Tis empty mental stimulus.", "5 When we the Word in spirit touch\nAs life the Spirit it becomes;\nThe Spirit, when expressed from us\nAs words of life to others comes.", "6 Our spirit we must exercise,\nTo take the Word most inwardly\nAnd then to give the Spirit forth;\nThe two as one with us should be.", "7 Lord, may Thy Word in me become,\nThe Spirit as my life supply\nAnd may Thy Spirit in Thy Word,\nMy true expression be thereby."]
