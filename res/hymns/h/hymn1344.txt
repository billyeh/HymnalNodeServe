["1 Oh, the depth of the riches\nAnd the wisdom and knowledge of God;\nHow unsearchable are His judgments;\nHow untraceable are His paths.\nFor who has known the mind of the Lord,\nOr who has been His counselor?\nOr who has first given to Him,\nAnd it will be repaid to Him?\nBecause out of Him and through Him\nAnd to Him are all things.\nTo Him be the glory forever. Amen."]
