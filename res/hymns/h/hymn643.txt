["1 Take time to behold Him,\nSpeak oft with Thy Lord,\nAbide in Him always,\nAnd feed on His Word.\nWait thou in His presence,\nSubmissive and meek,\nForgetting in nothing\nHis blessing to seek.", "2 Take time to behold Him,\nThe world rushes on;\nSpend much time in secret\nWith Jesus alone.\nBy looking to Jesus\nLike Him thou shalt be;\nThy friends, in thy conduct,\nHis likeness shall see.", "3 Take time to behold Him,\nLet Him be thy guide;\nAnd run not before Him\nWhatever betide;\nIn joy or in sorrow\nStill follow thy Lord,\nAnd, looking to Jesus,\nStill trust in His Word.", "4 Take time to behold Him,\nBe calm in thy soul,\nEach thought and each temper\nBeneath His control.\nThus led by His Spirit\nTo fountains of love,\nThou then shalt be fitted\nHis mercy to prove."]
