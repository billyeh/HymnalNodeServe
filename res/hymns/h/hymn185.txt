["1 Blessed Lord, our hallelujahs\nNow to Thee we raise.\nNever could we fully utter\nAll Thy worth and praise!", "chorus Praise the Lamb, for He is worthy!\nSweet eternal strain.\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nPraise the Lord! Amen.", "2 Praise the Lamb! Yes, Thou art worthy,\nWho didst shed Thy blood\nTo redeem Thy saints, and make us\nKings and priests to God!", "3 Hallelujah! Thou, Lord Jesus,\nCanst not cease to love;\nThine we are and Thine forever,\nOne with Thee above.", "4 Praise the Lord! Yes, hallelujah!\nWho would hush the song?\nJoin with saints from every nation\nEvery tribe and tongue."]
