["1 Living for Jesus, oh, what peace!\nRivers of pleasure never cease;\nTrials may come, yet I'll not fear,\nLiving for Jesus, He is near.", "chorus Help me to serve Thee more and more,\nHelp me to praise Thee o'er and o'er;\nLive in Thy presence day by day,\nNever to turn from Thee away.", "2 Living for Jesus, oh, what rest!\nPleasing my Savior, I am blest;\nOnly to live for Him alone,\nDoing His will till life is done.", "3 Living for Jesus, everywhere,\nAll of my burdens He doth bear;\nFriends may forsake me, He'll be true;\nTrusting in Him, He'll guide me through.", "4 Living for Jesus, till at last\nInto His glory I have passed;\nThere to behold Him on His throne,\nHear from His lips, \"My child, well done!\""]
