["1 I need Jesus, my need I now confess;\nNo friend like Him in times of deep distress;\nI need Jesus, the need I gladly own;\nThough some may bear their load alone,\nYet I need Jesus.", "chorus I need Jesus, I need Jesus,\nI need Jesus every day;\nNeed Him in the sunshine hour,\nNeed Him when the storm-clouds low'r;\nEvery day along my way,\nYes, I need Jesus.", "2 I need Jesus, I need a friend like Him,\nA friend to guide when paths of life are dim;\nI need Jesus, when foes my soul assail;\nAlone I know I can but fail,\nSo I need Jesus.", "3 I need Jesus, I need Him to the end;\nNo one like Him, He is the sinner's friend;\nI need Jesus, no other friend will do;\nSo constant, kind, so strong and true,\nYes, I need Jesus."]
