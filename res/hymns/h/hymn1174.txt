["1 What a victory! What a triumph!\nGod Himself became a man,\nClothed Himself in human nature\nTo fulfill His mighty plan.\nHe through death destroyed the devil;\nRisen now, the Son of Man!", "2 Jesus by His human virtues\nDid the subtle one arrest;\nHe as man withstood the tempter,\nFully passed through every test.\nNow in spirit I can take Him,\nAll His virtues to possess.", "3 In the Spirit of this Jesus\nIs His human life so fine.\nHuman virtues have been added\nTo the Spirit all divine.\nWhat abundance in this Spirit,\nRich supply for all mankind!", "4 How mysterious! Yet how real!\nSuch a man now lives in me.\nInto all my heart He's spreading-\nHe, my human life, to be.\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nI will praise unceasingly.", "5 Oh, what wonder! Oh, how glorious!\nGod in flesh is manifest.\nWe the members of His Body\nHis humanity express.\nFor the building of God's dwelling\nWe His human life possess."]
