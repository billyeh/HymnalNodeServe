["1 Come, O Thou Traveler unknown,\nWhom still I hold but cannot see;\nMy company before is gone,\nAnd I am left alone with Thee;\nWith Thee all night I mean to stay,\nAnd wrestle till the break of day.", "2 I need not tell Thee who I am,\nMy sin and misery declare;\nThyself hast called me by my name,\nLook on Thy hands, and read it there;\nBut who, I ask Thee, who art Thou?\nTell me Thy name, and tell me now.", "3 In vain Thou strugglest to get free;\nI never will unloose my hold;\nArt Thou the Man that died for me?\nThe secret of Thy love unfold;\nWrestling, I will not let Thee go,\nTill I Thy name, Thy nature know.", "4 Yield to me now, for I am weak,\nBut confident in self-despair;\nSpeak to my heart, in blessings speak,\nBe conquered by my instant prayer;\nSpeak, or Thou never hence shalt move,\nAnd tell me if Thy name be Love.", "5 'Tis Love! 'tis Love! Thou diedst for me,\nI hear Thy whisper in my heart;\nThe morning breaks, the shadows flee:\nPure, universal Love Thou art;\nTo me, to all Thy mercies move;\nThy nature and Thy name is Love.", "6 Lame as I am, I take the prey;\nHell, earth and sin, with ease o'ercome.\nI leap for joy, pursue my way,\nAnd, as a bounding hart, I run,\nThrough all eternity to prove\nThy nature and Thy name is Love."]
