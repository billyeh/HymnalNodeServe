["1 O Lord! When we the path retrace\nWhich Thou on earth hast trod,\nTo men Thy wondrous love and grace,\nThy faithfulness to God;", "2 Thy love, by man so sorely tried,\nProved stronger than the grave;\nThe very spear that pierced Thy side\nDrew forth the blood to save;", "3 Though Thou didst pass through woes and grief,\nThy works were ever good;\nAlthough midst sorrows all Thy life,\nThou spak'st no murmuring word.", "4 Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,\n'Mid darkness only light,\nThou didst Thy Father's name confess,\nAnd in His will delight;", "5 Unmoved by Satan's subtle wiles,\nOr suffering, shame, and loss,\nThy path, uncheered by earthly smiles,\nLed only to the cross.", "6 We wonder at Thy lowly mind,\nAnd fain would like Thee be,\nAnd all our rest and pleasure find\nIn learning, Lord, of Thee."]
