["1 Now is come salvation and strength\nAnd the kingdom of our God\nAnd the authority of His Christ:\nFor the accuser of our brethren is cast down\nWhich accused them before our God day and night.", "chorus And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,\nAnd by the word of their testimony\nAnd they loved not their soul lives unto death.\nTherefore rejoice, rejoice, rejoice!"]
