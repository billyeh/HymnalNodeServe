["1 Deep in me, Lord, mark Thou Thy holy Cross,\nOn motives, choices, private dear desires.\nLet all that self in any form inspires\nBe unto me as dross.", "2 And when Thy touch of death is here and there\nLaid on a thing most precious in mine eyes.\nLet me not wonder, let me recognize\nThe answer to my prayer."]
