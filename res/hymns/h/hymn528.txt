["1 The King of love my Shepherd is,\nWhose goodness faileth never;\nI nothing lack if I am His,\nAnd He is mine forever.", "2 Where streams of living water flow\nMy ransomed soul He leadeth,\nAnd, where the verdant pastures grow,\nWith food celestial feedeth.", "3 Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,\nBut yet in love He sought me,\nAnd on His shoulder gently laid,\nAnd home rejoicing brought me.", "4 In death's dark vale I fear no ill\nWith Thee, dear Lord, beside me;\nThy rod and staff my comfort still,\nThy Cross before to guide me.", "5 Thou spread'st a table in my sight;\nThy unction grace bestoweth;\nAnd oh, what transport of delight\nFrom Thy pure chalice floweth!", "6 And so through all the length of days\nThy goodness faileth never;\nGood Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise\nWithin Thy house forever."]
