["1 Through the bread and cup, Lord Jesus\nWe Thy death exhibit here;\nWhat Thy love has done reviewing\nAll Thy suff'ring we revere.\nBread and cup in separation\nShow that Thou thru death hast gone;\nGrateful now, our spirit worships\nAnd to Thee we give our song.", "chorus Thine the cup of suff'ring\nMine the cup of blessing;\nFor Thy love in Thy redemption\nPraise we ever sing!", "2 Thou, in love, hast shed Thy blood, Lord\nBringing us to God in grace\nThat from God, no longer severed\nWe may ever see His face.\nAll God's righteousness and glory,\nHave been fully satisfied;\nThru Thy death's abundant merit,\nWe may now with God abide.", "3 By Thy death the veil was riven\nOpened was the holiest place\nAll the barriers have been broken;\nWe approach the throne of grace\nThere receiving grace and mercy\nThus the timely need to meet\nDrinking as of living water\nTasting God Himself replete.", "4 Thou in grace hast so redeemed us\nWe the priests may be fore'er,\nTo fulfill that holy office\nAll God's sweetness thus to share.\nSuch a blessing, such a mercy\nFrom Thy death for us ensue;\nWe would ever Thee remember,\nTill with Thee we drink anew."]
