["1 Christ is coming! let creation\nFrom her groans and travail cease,\nLet the glorious proclamation\nHope restore, and faith increase.\nChrist is coming! Christ is coming!\nCome, Thou blessed Prince of Peace.", "2 Earth can now but tell the story\nOf Thy bitter cross and pain;\nShe shall yet behold Thy glory\nWhen Thou comest back to reign.\nChrist is coming! Christ is coming!\nLet each heart repeat the strain.", "3 Long Thy people have been pining\nFor Thy peace and rest, and Thee,\nSoon, in heav'nly glory shining,\nTheir Restorer shall they see.\nChrist is coming! Christ is coming!\nHaste the joyous jubilee.", "4 With that blessed hope before us,\nLet no harp remain unstrung;\nLet the mighty advent chorus\nOnward roll on every tongue.\nChrist is coming! Christ is coming!\nCome, Lord Jesus, quickly come."]
