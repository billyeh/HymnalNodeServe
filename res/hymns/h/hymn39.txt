["1 To God be the glory, great things He hath done,\nSo loved He the world that He gave us His Son,\nWho yielded His life our redemption to win,\nAnd opened the life-gate that all may go in.", "chorus Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,\nLet the earth hear His voice;\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord,\nLet the people rejoice;\nOh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,\nAnd give Him the glory; great things He hath done.", "2 Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,\nTo every believer the promise of God;\nThe vilest offender who truly believes,\nThat moment from Jesus a pardon receives.", "3 Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,\nAnd great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;\nBut purer, and higher, and greater will be\nOur wonder, our transport when Jesus we see."]
