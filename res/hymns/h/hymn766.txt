["1 Teach me to pray, Lord, teach me to pray;\nThis is my heart-cry day unto day;\nI long to know Thy will and Thy way;\nTeach me to pray, Lord, teach me to pray.", "chorus Living in Thee, Lord, and Thou in me,\nConstant abiding, this is my plea;\nGrant me Thy power, boundless and free,\nPower with men and power with Thee.", "2 Power in prayer, Lord, power in prayer!\nHere 'mid earth's sin and sorrow and care,\nMen lost and dying, souls in despair;\nO give me power, power in prayer!", "3 My weakened will, Lord, Thou canst renew;\nMy sinful nature Thou canst subdue;\nFill me just now with power anew;\nPower to pray and power to do!", "4 Teach me to pray, Lord, teach me to pray;\nThou art my pattern day unto day;\nThou art my surety, now and for aye;\nTeach me to pray, Lord, teach me to pray."]
