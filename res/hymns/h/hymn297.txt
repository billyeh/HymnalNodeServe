["1 \"No condemnation!\" precious word!\nConsider it, my soul!\nThy sins were all on Jesus laid,\nHis stripes have made thee whole.", "2 In God's own presence now for us\nThe Savior doth appear;\nThe saints, as jewels on His heart,\nJesus doth ever bear.", "3 \"No condemnation!\" O my soul,\n'Tis God that speaks the word;\nPerfect in comeliness art thou\nIn Christ, the risen Lord.", "4 Teach me, O God, to fix mine eyes\nOn Christ, the spotless Lamb,\nSo shall I love Thy precious will,\nAnd glorify His name."]
