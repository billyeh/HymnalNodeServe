["1 On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,\nThe emblem of suff'ring and shame,\nAnd I love that old cross where the Dearest and Best\nFor a world of lost sinners was slain.", "chorus So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,\nTill my trophies at last I lay down;\nI will cling to the old rugged cross,\nAnd exchange it some day for a crown.", "2 Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,\nHas a wondrous attraction for me;\nFor the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,\nTo bear it to dark Calvary.", "3 In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,\nA wondrous beauty I see;\nFor 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,\nTo pardon and sanctify me."]
