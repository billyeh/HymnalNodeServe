["1 To Thee, dear Lord, O Christ of God,\nWe sing, we ever sing;\nFor Thou hast shed Thy precious blood\nOur cup of joy to bring.\nThy mighty arm the fight hath fought,\nThou art enthroned above;\nWe into glory will be brought\nThy wondrous grace to prove.", "2 To Thee, dear Lord, O Christ of God,\nWe sing, we ever sing;\nThou hast invaded death's abode\nAnd robbed him of his sting.\nThe house of dust enthralls no more,\nFor Thou, the strong to save,\nThyself doth guard that silent door,\nGreat Keeper of the grave.", "3 To Thee, dear Lord, O Christ of God,\nWe sing, we ever sing;\nFor Thou hast crushed beneath Thy rod\nThe world's proud rebel king,\nAnd plunged in Thine imperial strength\nTo gulfs of darkness down,\nAnd brought Thy trophy up at length\nThe foiled usurper's crown.", "4 To Thee, dear Lord, O Christ of God,\nWe sing, we ever sing;\nThou hast redeemed us with Thy blood\nFrom every evil thing.\nGod's saving strength Thine arm upbore,\nThe arm that set us free;\nGlory, O Christ, for evermore\nBe to Thy God and Thee."]
