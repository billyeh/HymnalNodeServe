["1 Man's Creator has a purpose\nFor our being here on earth.\nIn His image we're created,\nTo express His rule on earth.\nBut man fell to Satan's tempting;\nThus God's goal was hid from view.\nStill our God will have His kingdom,\nFor His Son will see it through.", "2 Jesus Christ will get His kingdom\nNotwithstanding Satan's plans;\nHe's obtaining something real by\nGrowing in the hearts of man.\nNothing like religion teaches:\n\"You must wait until you die\"-\nFor the kingdom Christ is building,\nIs on earth before our eyes.", "3 His Son, Jesus, is our Savior.\nOnce in human form He came.\nNow as Spirit He can enter\nAs the breath of life to man.\nAs a seed within our spirit\nChrist takes root and starts to grow,\nSpreading in our inmost being\nTill His life we come to know.", "4 Time is short, oh, brothers, hear it,\nChrist is longing for His Bride.\nWe can hasten His returning\nSimply by the growth in life.\nNo more struggling, no more striving,\nSimply turn to Christ within.\nSee the seed begin to blossom.\nGrowing fully into Him.", "5 Jesus Christ will get His kingdom\nJust by growth-the normal way.\nNot an instant transformation;\nGrowth goes on from day to day.\nThis life-seed is all-inclusive-\nEverything we'll ever need;\nYes, our God's eternal purpose\nIs within this precious seed."]
