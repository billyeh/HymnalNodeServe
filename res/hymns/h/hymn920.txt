["1 Sound ye the trumpet-call;\nHeralds proclaim\nJesus as Lord of all,\nSound forth His fame;\nTell of His great renown,\nLift high the kingly crown,\nLet every knee bow down\nAt His blest name.", "2 Who will go forth for Him?\nWho will arise?\nThough eyes with tears are dim,\nSevered love's ties:\nCounting all things but loss,\nEarth's highest gain but dross,\nAnd glorying in the cross,\nWho will arise?", "3 Go, for the crowning day\nDraws ever near;\nTime will soon pass away,\nJesus be here:\nRaise ye the cross where now\nNations to idols bow;\nDawn o'er the mountain's brow\nTells He is near.", "4 Hark to the trumpet-blast!\nJesus is King!\nHe comes to reign at last,\nAll conquering:\nThen the wide world shall own,\nBending before His throne,\nJesus is King alone,\nJesus is King!"]
