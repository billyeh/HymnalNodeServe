["1 Do you see them in the cities,\nMeeting on the local ground?\nThey're the local, golden lampstands,\nWhere the Lord His home has found.", "chorus 'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,\nWhere all the saints dwell as one!\n'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,\nWhere all the saints dwell as one!", "2 Do you see them in the meetings,\nLifting up their voice on high,\nEvery brother, sister sharing,\nChrist the Lord to magnify?", "3 Do you hear them all pray-reading,\nBreathing in the living Word?\nPraying, praising, drinking, feeding,\nHow they all enjoy the Lord!", "4 Do you hear them call, \"Lord Jesus\"?\nHow they love that blessed name!\nAll the more their joy increases\nAs His Lordship they proclaim.", "5 Have you heard their hallelujahs,\nLike a mighty thunder blast?\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nDown the enemy is cast!", "6 Do you see the saints migrating?\nPraise the Lord the move is on\nFor the church in every city\nThat our blessed Lord may come!", "7 Do you see the Lord is coming\nFor the church for whom He died?\nIn the churches He's preparing\nNow His holy, chosen Bride.", "chorus 'Tis a glorious church without spot or wrinkle,\nFilled with the glory of the Lord!\n'Tis a glorious church without spot or wrinkle,\nFilled with the glory of the Lord!"]
