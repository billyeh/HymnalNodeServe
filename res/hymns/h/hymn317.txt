["1 Dear Savior, Thou art mine,\nHow sweet the thought to me;\nLet me repeat Thy name,\nAnd lift my heart to Thee.", "chorus Mine! Mine! Mine!\nI know Thou art mine;\nSavior, dear Savior,\nI know Thou art mine.", "2 Thou art the sinner's friend,\nSo I Thy friendship claim,\nA sinner saved by grace,\nWhen Thy sweet message came.", "3 My hardened heart was touched;\nThy pard'ning voice I heard;\nAnd joy and peace came in\nWhile list'ning to Thy word.", "4 So let me sing Thy praise,\nSo let me call Thee mine.\nI cannot doubt Thy word,\nI know that I am Thine."]
