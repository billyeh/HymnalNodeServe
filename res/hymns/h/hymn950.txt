I shall be like Thy Son?\nIs this the grace which He for me has won?\nFather of glory-thought beyond all thought!\nIn glory, to His own blest likeness brought!", "2 Oh, Jesus, Lord, who loved me like to Thee?\nFruit of Thy work, with Thee, too, there to see\nThy glory, Lord, while endless ages roll,\nMyself the prize and travail of Thy soul.", "3 Yet it must be: \"Thy love had not its rest\nWere Thy redeemed not with Thee fully blest;\nThat love that gives not as the world, but shares\nAll it possesses with its loved co-heirs.", "4 Nor I alone; Thy loved ones, all complete\nIn glory, round Thee there with joy shall meet\nAll like Thee, for Thy glory like Thee, Lord,\nObject supreme of all, by all adored."]
