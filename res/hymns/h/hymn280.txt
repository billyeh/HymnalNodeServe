["1 Lord, may Thy blood now cleanse me\nWash all my sins away\nThat with Thy Holy Spirit,\nThou may anoint, I pray.\nMy service, I confess, Lord\nIs failure-full and weak;\nThe filling of Thy Spirit,\nTo live for Thee I seek.", "chorus Oh, from myself deliver\nFrom all its misery;\nI'd henceforth be forever,\nCompletely filled with Thee.", "2 Oh, Lord, how dry my heart is\nIt yearns and pants for Thee;\nThe filling of Thy Spirit,\nIs now my fervent plea.\nWithin the smitten Rock, Lord\nI would entirely hide;\nPour thru Thy living water\nTill I am satisfied.", "3 How cold my heart has been, Lord\nHow slow obeying Thee;\nSo fill me with Thy Spirit\nI'll ne'er rebellious be.\nI lie upon Thy altar,\nAnd dare not move away;\nOh, may Thy flame descending,\nConsume my all, I pray.", "4 Oh, may Thy Cross within me,\nDeepen its work and burn,\nIn me enlarge Thy measure\nAnd me to ashes turn.\nOh, may Thy Spirit fill me,\nEach day more than before\nAnd may Thy living water,\nOn me and thru me pour."]
