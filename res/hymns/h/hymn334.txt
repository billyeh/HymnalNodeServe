["1 A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,\nA wonderful Savior to me;\nHe hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,\nWhere rivers of pleasure I see.", "chorus He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock\nThat shadows a dry, thirsty land;\nHe hideth my life in the depths of His love,\nAnd covers me there with His hand,\nAnd covers me there with His hand.", "2 A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,\nHe taketh my burden away;\nHe holdeth me up and I shall not be moved,\nHe giveth me strength as my day.", "3 With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,\nAnd, filled with His fulness divine,\nI sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,\nFor such a Redeemer as mine!", "4 When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise\nTo meet Him in clouds of the sky,\nHis perfect salvation, His wonderful love,\nI'll shout with the millions on high."]
