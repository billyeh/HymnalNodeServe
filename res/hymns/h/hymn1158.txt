["1 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,\nThou hast won each love from me;\nWho like Thee-so fair and comely?\nWho like Thee-so sweet and lovely?\nMatchless One, unrivaled beauty,\nNone can e'er compete with Thee!", "2 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,\nGladly will I hear Thy call;\nSince Thy voice my heart hath entered,\nI from all things could but sever;\nVoid are all my other seekings,\nEvery pride hath disappeared.", "3 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,\nHow can I still stubborn be?\nAt Thy feet cast all my hard'nings,\nAnd return with songs and singings;\n'Tis my love to be Thy bondslave,\n'Tis my joy to Thee obey.", "4 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,\nThy way only will I choose;\nThough in tears while I'm obeying,\nYet I would not change my standing;\nAll I long for is Thy pleasure,\nAnd the peace Thy love would bring.", "5 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,\nWhen Thy presence does depart,\nSeems the dawn has lost its traces,\nHidden are my smiling faces;\nAll I yearn for is Thy coming\nAnd Thy presence' sweet embrace.", "6 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,\nCan I tell it all to Thee?\nThou my love and satisfaction,\nThou my everlasting portion;\nThou art all that I desire,\nNothing else I would pursue.", "7 Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,\nAll I have I give to Thee;\nWho like Thee-so fair and comely?\nWho like Thee-so sweet and lovely?\nMatchless One, unrivaled beauty,\nNone can e'er compete with Thee!"]
