["1 Through countless ages, many men\nHave longed and sought and tried to see\nThe secret of the universe,\nSo vast, so great a mystery.", "2 Yet not through struggling could frail man\nThe secret of this myst'ry find;\nNor chance, by stumbling, come upon\nSuch hidden things-to these he's blind.", "3 Behold in heav'n a throne is set,\nAnd One upon the throne revealed;\nAnd held in His right hand a scroll-\nThe mystery is tightly sealed.", "4 Through all the universe, a cry-\n'Can one be found of such great worth\nThe scroll to take?' ... yet no reply,\nFrom heav'n, below, or on the earth.", "5 Were it a matter now for man\nBy chance, or some ability,\nThen surely one would now step forth\nTo open God's economy.", "6 Yet sad and solemn was that sight.\nJohn wept as then he looked around;\nAnd we, too, still might weeping be\nIf none at all were worthy found.", "7 But then the angel said, 'Weep not!\nBehold, the Lion has prevailed\nTo take the scroll and loose its seals;\nHe has the mystery now unveiled!'", "8 So, John looked up the Lion to see,\nBut, lo, he then beheld a Lamb;\nChrist both o'ercame the enemy,\nAnd wrought redemption's work for man.", "9 The angels fall before His throne,\nFour living creatures offer praise,\nAll glory to the Lion-Lamb;\nLet us with theirs our voices raise!"]
