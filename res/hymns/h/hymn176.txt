["1 Jesus, wondrous Savior!\nChrist, of kings the King!\nAngels fall before Thee,\nProstrate, worshipping;\nFairest they confess Thee\nIn the heav'n above.\nWe would sing Thee fairest\nHere in hymns of love.", "2 All earth's flowing pleasures\nWere a wintry sea;\nHeav'n itself without Thee\nDark as night would be.\nLamb of God! Thy glory\nIs the light above.\nLamb of God! Thy glory\nIs the life of love.", "3 Life is death, if severed\nFrom Thy throbbing heart.\nDeath with life abundant\nAt Thy touch would start.\nWorlds and men and angels\nAll consist in Thee,\nYet Thou camest to us\nIn humility.", "4 Jesus! all perfections\nRise and end in Thee;\nBrightness of God's glory\nThou, eternally.\nFavored beyond measure\nThey Thy face who see;\nMay we, gracious Savior,\nShare this ecstasy."]
