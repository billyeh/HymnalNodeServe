["1 Lord, when the Father ne'er was known\nThe Father came through Thee below\nThat we who lived in ignorance,\nMight through Thyself the Father know.", "2 But, Lord, when Thou wast here on earth\nHow scarce were those Thyself who knew;\nA veil there was 'twixt Thee and them;\nThey crowded 'round, but saw not through.", "3 Now as the Spirit Thou hast come,\nE:en as the Father came in Thee;\nAs we through Thee the Father know\nNow through the Spirit we know Thee.", "4 Not with the flesh Thou now art clothed-\nThen must Thou walk with toil around;\nBut as the Spirit in our heart,\nThou dost supply Thyself unbound.", "5 Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called\nBut now.the Holy Spirit art;\nThe Spirit is Thine other form\nThyself to dwell within our heart.", "6 By knowing Thee as Spirit, Lord\nWe realize Thy life's outflow\nThy glory and Thy character\nAnd all Thy being's wonders know.", "7 Praise to Thy Name now floods our heart;\nThere is no one as dear as Thee;\nFor since we know how real Thou art\nNo other one could lovelier be."]
