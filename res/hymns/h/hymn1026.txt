["1 Today the Savior calls;\nYe wand'rers come:\nO ye benighted souls!\nWhy longer roam?", "2 Today the Savior calls;\nO hear Him now!\nBefore your day is gone,\nTo Jesus bow.", "3 Today the Savior calls;\nFor refuge fly;\nThe storm of vengeance falls,\nAnd death is nigh.", "4 The Spirit calls today;\nYield to His pow'r;\nO grieve Him not away,\n'Tis mercy's hour!"]
