["1 Can you be obedient\nTo the Lord of all,\nThough the earth should totter,\nThough the heav'ns should fall?\nFace e'en a disaster\nWith a faith-filled heart,\nKnowing naught can harm him\nWho with Christ will start?", "2 Can you be obedient\nTo the Lord you serve,\nNever even flinch, friend,\nNever even swerve;\nThough your next step onward\nSeem to lead to death?\nCan you then obey Him\nWithout bated breath?", "3 Can you trust your Leader\nWhen He bids you go\nRight into a battle\nWith a mighty foe?\nCan you step up briskly\nAnd with joy obey?\nCan you fight the battle,\nTill the end of day?", "4 Can you? Then beloved,\nChrist just waits for you;\nListen for His orders,\nGlad His will to do;\nThen when soldiers muster\nAt the set of sun,\nAnd your name is mentioned,\nChrist will say, \"Well done.\""]
