["1 The cross that He gave may be heavy,\nBut it ne'er outweighs His grace;\nThe storm that I feared may surround me,\nBut it ne'er excludes His face.", "chorus The cross is not greater than His grace,\nThe storm cannot hide His blessed face;\nI am satisfied to know\nThat with Jesus here below,\nI can conquer every foe.", "2 The thorns in my path are not sharper\nThan composed His crown for me;\nThe cup that I drink not more bitter\nThan He drank in Gethsemane.", "3 The light of His love shineth brighter,\nAs it falls on paths of woe;\nThe toil of my work groweth lighter,\nAs I stoop to raise the low.", "4 His will I have joy in fulfilling,\nAs I'm walking in His sight;\nMy trials more blessings are bringing,\nChrist in them is my delight."]
