["1 My faith looks up to Thee,\nThou Lamb of Calvary,\nSavior Divine;\nNow hear me while I pray;\nTake all my guilt away;\nOh, let me from this day\nBe wholly Thine.", "2 May Thy rich grace impart\nStrength to my fainting heart,\nMy zeal inspire;\nAs Thou hast died for me,\nOh, may my love to Thee\nPure, warm, and changeless be,\nA living fire.", "3 While life's dark maze I tread,\nAnd griefs around me spread,\nBe Thou my Guide;\nBid darkness turn to day,\nWipe sorrow's tears away,\nNor let me ever stray\nFrom Thee aside.", "4 All thru life's transient dream,\nUntil death's sullen stream\nShall o'er me roll,\nBlest Savior, with Thy love,\nFear and distrust remove;\nMake me Thy grace to prove\nTransform my soul."]
