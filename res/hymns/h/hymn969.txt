["1 Hark what a sound, and too divine for hearing,\nStirs on the earth and trembles in the air;\nIs it the thunder of the Lord's appearing?\nIs it the music of His people's prayer?", "2 Surely He cometh, and a thousand voices\nShout to the saints, and to the deaf and dumb;\nSurely He cometh, and the earth rejoices,\nGlad in His coming who hath sworn: \"I come!", "3 This hath He done, and shall we not adore Him?\nThis shall He do, and can we still despair?\nCome, let us quickly fling ourselves before Him, .\nCast at His feet the burden of our care.", "4 Thru life and death, thru sorrow and thru sinning\nHe shall suffice me, for He hath sufficed:\nChrist is the end, for Christ was the beginning,\nChrist the beginning, for the end is Christ."]
