["1 Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling-\nCalling for you and for me;\nPatiently Jesus is waiting and watching-\nWatching for you and for me!", "chorus Come home! come home!\nYe who are weary, come home!\nEarnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,\nCalling, O sinner, come home!", "2 Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading-\nPleading for you and for me?\nWhy should we linger and heed not His mercies-\nMercies for you and for me?", "3 Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing-\nPassing from you and from me;\nShadows are gathering, death-beds are coming-\nComing for you and for me!", "4 Oh, for the wonderful love He has promised-\nPromised for you and for me!\nThough we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon-\nPardon for you and for me!"]
