["1 With all the pow'r in heav'n and earth,\nOur resurrected Lord's endued;\nIf we unite and live by Him\nThe enemy will be subdued.", "2 In Jesus' name we must declare,\nThat we shall overcome the foe;\nWe draw authority from Him,\nThe serpent's head to crush below.", "3 No matter what, thou mountain high\nIn heav'n or earth, where'er thou art\nAt any cost we'll level thee\nIn Jesus' name thou must depart!", "4 Faith orders thee \"Remove from here\nAnd be thou cast into the sea!\nWe should, we must, we can, we will\nFulfill God's purpose faithfully."]
