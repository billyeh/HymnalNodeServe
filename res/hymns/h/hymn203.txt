["1 In the bosom of the Father\nEre the ages had begun\nThou wast in the Father's glory\nGod's unique begotten Son.\nWhen to us the Father gave Thee\nThou in person wast the same\nAll the fulness of the Father,\nIn the Spirit to proclaim.", "2 By Thy death and resurrection\nThou wast made God's firstborn Son;\nBy Thy life to us imparting\nWas Thy duplication done.\nWe, in Thee regenerated\nMany sons to God became;\nTruly as Thy many brethren\nWe are as Thyself the same.", "3 Once Thou wast the only grain, Lord\nFalling to the earth to die\nThat thru death and resurrection,\nThou in life may multiply.\nWe were brought forth in Thy nature,\nAnd the many grains became;\nAs one loaf we all are blended\nAll Thy fulness to proclaim,", "4 We're Thy total reproduction\nThy dear Body and Thy Bride\nThine expression and Thy fulness\nFor Thee ever to abide.\nWe are Thy continuation\nThy life-increase and Thy spread\nThy full growth and Thy rich surplus\nOne with Thee, our glorious Head."]
