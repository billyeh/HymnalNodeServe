["1 One new man is the Father's plan;\nHe redeemed us from the sons of men.\nEvery kindred, tribe and tongue,\nIn Himself He called us to be one.\nGod's expression on the earth\nNow reveals His glorious worth.\nOne new man is the Father's plan;\nHe redeemed us from the sons of men.", "2 On the cross ordinances slain,\nThat He might form just one of twain.\nReconciling us to God,\nThus on the serpent's head He trod.\nHe breaks down the middle wall\nAs upon His name we call;\nOn the cross ordinances slain,\nThat He might form just one of twain.", "3 For this cause Your Person, Lord,\nWe take and stand in one accord;\nAll the members self forsake,\nAnd of the Body-Christ partake.\nWe in Christ as one new man\nNow come forth to take this land.\nFor this cause Your Person, Lord,\nWe take and stand in one accord."]
