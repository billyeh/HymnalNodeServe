["1 We have found the Christ who's all in all;\nHe is everything to us;\nO how blest upon His name to call,\nHow divine, how glorious!", "chorus It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,\nFull of glory, full of glory;\nIt is joy unspeakable and full of glory,\nAnd the half has never yet been told!", "2 We have found that Christ the Spirit is\nWho within our spirit dwells;\nHow available, how near He is,\nAnd His sweetness all excels.", "3 We have found the way to live by Christ-\nPray His Word and call His name!\nThis-the eating, drinking-has sufficed\nAnd its worth we now proclaim.", "4 We have found the local church, our home;\nWe are home and home indeed!\nNevermore in Babylon we roam;\nIn the church is all we need.", "5 We have found that meeting with the saints\nIs the greatest joy on earth;\n'Tis by this our spirit never faints\nAnd our lives are filled with worth."]
