["1 Jesus, the sinner's Friend,\nWe hide ourselves in Thee;\nGod looks upon Thy sprinkled blood,\nIt is our only plea.", "2 He hears Thy precious Name,\nWe claim it as our own;\nThe Father must accept and bless\nHis well-beloved Son.", "3 Thou hast fulfilled the law,\nAnd we are justified:\nOurs is the blessing, Thine the curse;\nWe live, for Thou hast died.", "4 Jesus, the sinner's Friend!\nWe cannot speak Thy praise;\nNo mortal voice can sing the song\nThat ransomed hearts would raise.", "5 But when before the throne,\nThy face we all shall see,\nClothed in our blood-bought robes of white,\nWe'll stand complete in Thee.", "6 Jesus, we'll give Thee then\nSuch praises as are meet,\nAnd give ten thousand thanks to Thee,\nAdoring, at Thy feet."]
