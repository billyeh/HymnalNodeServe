["1 How wonderful redemption is,\nMy gracious Lord, in Thee!\nNot seen, nor heard, nor e’er conceived\nWhat Thou hast done for me!\nThou art divine, mysterious,\nBeyond my grandest phrase!\nRedemption is so marvellous,\nBeyond all pow’r to praise!", "2 For us Thou on the Cross wast pierced,\nAnd blood and water streamed;\nThat life divine be giv’n to us,\nThat we may be redeemed.\nThy precious blood has made us clean,\nThat we accepted be;\nRegenerated by Thy life,\nWe now are one with Thee.", "3 Thou art the grain divine that died\nThe many grains to bear,\nWhich, blent and formed, Thy Body are.\nAnd all Thy nature share.\nWe are the increase of Thyself,\nAnd Thou our content art;\nThrough us Thou livest and dost move\nAnd manifested art.", "4 Since we’re Thy Body, Thou may come\nAnd settle down in us;\nIn us Thou may obtain Thy home\nAnd we become Thy trust.\nThy heart to satisfy and please,\nWe are Thy counterpart,\nNow in one Body with Thyself,\nEnjoying all Thou art.", "5 While in remembrance now we meet\nAnd here the symbols see,\nFor Thy redemption great and full\nWe’re filled with praise to Thee.\nSince we are made Thy Body, Lord,\nThy dwelling place and bride,\nWe would give thanks and worship Thee\nAnd in Thy praise abide."]
