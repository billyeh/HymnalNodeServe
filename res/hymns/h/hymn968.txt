["1 Hail to the Lord's Anointed,\nGreat David's greater Son!\nHail, in the time appointed,\nHis reign on earth begun!\nHe comes to break oppression,\nTo set the captive free;\nTo take away transgression,\nAnd rule in equity.", "2 He shall come down like showers\nUpon the fruitful earth;\nAnd love, joy, hope, like flowers,\nSpring in His path to birth:\nBefore Him on the mountains\nShall peace, the herald, go;\nAnd righteousness, in fountains,\nFrom hill to valley flow.", "3 Kings shall fall down before Him,\nAnd gold and incense bring;\nAll nations shall adore Him,\nHis praise all people sing;\nFor He shall have dominion\nO'er river, sea, and shore,\nFar as the eagle's pinion,\nOr dove's light wing can soar.", "4 To Him shall prayer unceasing\nAnd daily vows ascend;\nHis kingdom still increasing,\nA kingdom without end.\nThe mountain dews shall nourish\nA seed in weakness sown,\nWhose fruit shall spread and flourish,\nAnd shake like Lebanon.", "5 O'er every foe victorious\nHe on His throne shall rest,\nFrom age to age more glorious,\nAll-blessing and all-blest.\nThe tide of time shall never\nHis covenant remove;\nHis Name shall stand forever,\nHis changeless Name of Love."]
