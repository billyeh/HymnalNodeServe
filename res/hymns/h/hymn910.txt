["1 The overflow of life is work\nThe work should be our living!\nWhat we experience e'er should be,\nThe message we are giving.\nWhen living and the work are one\nThe work will be effectual;\nWhen message and the life are one\nThe word will be successful.", "2 The work must be the fruit of life\nBorn thru the Spirit's flowing;\nAs branches of the Lord, the vine\nFruit bearing, life bestowing.\n'Tis Christ Himself thru us to work\nHimself as life expressing\nAnd all the riches of His life,\nTo others manifesting.", "3 'Tis not a movement borne of man\nBut by His power moving;\n'Tis not the deeds done outwardly\nBut inward action proving.\n'Tis not the work of enterprise\nBut 'tis His life confessing;\n'Tis not to toil for our success\nBut 'tis Himself expressing.", "4 Our plans, our aims, our energy,\nWe must abandon wholly\nThat He may work His plan thru us\nHis aim and object solely.\nOurselves, with all we are and have\nTo death we must surrender\nThat Christ may live Himself thru us,\nWith riches and with splendor."]
