["1 If you are tired of the load of your sin,\nLet Jesus come into your heart;\nIf you desire a new life to begin,\nLet Jesus come into your heart.", "chorus Just now, your doubtings give o'er;\nJust now, reject Him no more;\nJust now, throw open the door;\nLet Jesus come into your heart.", "2 If 'tis for purity now that you sigh,\nLet Jesus come into your heart;\nFountains for cleansing are flowing near by,\nLet Jesus come into your heart.", "3 If there's a tempest your voice cannot still,\nLet Jesus come into your heart;\nIf there's a void this world never can fill,\nLet Jesus come into your heart."]
