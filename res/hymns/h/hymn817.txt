["1 We limit not the truth of God\nTo our poor reach of mind,\nBy notions of our day and sect,\nCrude, partial and confined.\nNow let a new and better hope\nWithin our hearts be stirred:\nThe Lord hath yet more light and truth\nTo break forth from His Word.", "2 Who dares to bind by his dull sense\nThe oracles of heaven,\nFor all the nations, tongues and climes\nAnd all the ages given!\nThe universe how much unknown!\nThat ocean unexplored!\nThe Lord hath yet more light and truth\nTo break forth from His Word.", "3 Darkling our great forefathers went\nThe first steps of the way;\n'Twas but the dawning yet to grow\nInto the perfect day;\nAnd grow it shall, our glorious Sun\nMore fervid rays afford:\nThe Lord hath yet more light and truth\nTo break forth from His Word.", "4 The valleys past, ascending still,\nOur souls would higher climb,\nAnd look down from supernal heights,\nOn all the bygone times;\nUpward we press, the air is clear,\nAnd the sphere-music heard!\nThe Lord hath yet more light and truth\nTo break forth from His Word.", "5 O Father, Son and Spirit, send\nUs increase from above;\nEnlarge, expand all Christian hearts\nTo comprehend Thy love;\nAnd make us all go on to know\nWith nobler powers conferred:\nThe Lord hath yet more light and truth\nTo break forth from His Word."]
