["1 Our God and Father, we respond anew\nTo love in Christ revealed, and praise Thy Name.\nHe did Thy will; and for the joy in view,\nEndured the cross, despising all the shame.", "2 He, midst His brethren, strikes the note of praise;\nWe hear His song, our hearts responsive swell;\nAnd on this day when He His voice doth raise,\nIn spirit we do join and praise Thee well.", "3 Chosen in Him Thy well-beloved Son,\nWe have our part in joy before Thy face;\nPredestined, ere this world had yet begun,\nFor that blest world, where all bespeaks Thy grace.", "4 Sons loved and loving, whom Thy Spirit fills,\nOur endless portion Christ in us to be;\nEach with some trait of Him whose love us thrills,\nFor Thy delight and joy eternally."]
