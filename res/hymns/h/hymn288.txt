["1 I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!\nHe loved me ere I knew Him;\nHe drew me with the cords of love,\nAnd thus He bound me to Him.\nAnd round my heart still closely twine\nThose ties which naught can sever,\nFor I am His, and He is mine,\nForever and forever.", "2 I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!\nHe bled, He died to save me;\nAnd not alone the gift of life,\nBut His own self He gave me.\nNaught that I have my own I call,\nI hold it for the Giver;\nMy heart, my strength, my life, my all,\nAre His, and His forever.", "3 I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!\nSo kind, and true, and tender,\nSo wise a Counsellor and Guide,\nSo mighty a Defender!\nFrom Him who loves me now so well,\nWhat power my soul can sever?\nShall life or death, or earth or hell?\nNo? I am His forever."]
