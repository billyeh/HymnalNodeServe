["1 Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom's coming,\nAnd the time will not be long\nBefore we hail that wedding morning\nAnd lift up the glad new song.", "chorus Oh, wondrous day! Oh, glorious morning,\nWhen the Christ we love shall come:\nWith vessels filled and lamps all burning\nLet us welcome His return.\nRejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom's coming\nAnd the time will not be long\nBefore we hail that wedding morning\nAnd lift up the glad new song.", "2 Oh, let us now redeem each moment,\nMore the precious oil to buy,\nAnd have our vessels filled with ointment\nEre we hear the midnight cry.", "3 Oh, what a joy it is preparing\nFor our wedding with the Lord,\nE'en in the tribulations sharing\nFor the bliss of such reward!", "4 Oh, with what rapture and rejoicing\nShall the wedding day begin;\nAnd then a thousand years of dining\nAt the marriage feast with Him!"]
