["1 Have you found the great Physician,\nJesus Christ of Galilee?\nHe who bore our pain and sorrow,\nOn the shameful, cruel tree?\nStill He heals the sick and suff'ring,\nAs before He went away;\nFor His word most plainly tells us,\n\"He is just the same today.\"", "chorus He is just the same today;\nAs before He went away.\nLook to Him, believe and pray;\nTrust His word and then obey.\n\"Praise God, He is just the same today.\"", "2 Consecrate your life to Jesus,\nSpirit, soul, and body too;\nFor \"the Lord is for the body,\"\nEvery pow'r He gave to you.\nLet there be no reservation,\nGive the Lord full right of way;\nHe will come and heal His temple,\nFor He is the same today.", "3 Do you doubt God's will to heal you?\nTake His word and ask for light;\nIf you seek in deep contrition,\nHe will guide your heart aright.\nDo not fear to claim His promise,\nHe will not your trust betray;\nWhen on earth He gladly healed them,\nAnd He is the same today.", "4 Oh! I'm glad to tell you, suff'rer,\nChrist has more than healing too;\nLife abundant overflowing,\nHe will gladly give to you.\nStep out boldly, claim His fulness,\nLet your sadness flee away;\nWhen on earth He made them joyful,\nAnd He is the same today."]
