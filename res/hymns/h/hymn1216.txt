["1 We have an inner life; that's for our daily life;\nThat's for the meeting life-just Christ!\nWe'll live the inner life; we'll have the daily life;\nWe'll see the meeting life-that's just the church.", "2 Christ is our inner life; He's in our spirit now;\nNot far away from us-He's right inside!\nAnd as we turn to Him and take Him as our all\nHe will become in us our inner life.", "3 Out from our inner life will come our daily life,\nAnd all our living be filled up with Christ.\nThen as we live by Him, He lives His life in us,\nAnd He becomes to us our daily life.", "4 The real experience of Christ in daily life,\nWill fill the meeting life with Christ Himself.\nNot empty forms and such, but Christ will be so much;\nAnd we will see Him here as the meeting life.", "5 Without the inner life there is no daily life,\nThere is no meeting life, there is no church!\nChrist as our inner life, Christ in our daily life\nWill make the meeting life new and glorious!"]
