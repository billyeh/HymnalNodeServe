["1 I know not what awaits me,\nGod kindly veils my eyes,\nAnd o'er each step of my onward way\nHe makes new scenes to rise;\nAnd every joy He sends me comes\nA sweet and glad surprise.", "chorus Where He may lead I'll follow,\nMy trust in Him repose;\nAnd every hour in perfect peace,\nI'll sing, \"He knows, He knows\";\nAnd every hour in perfect peace,\nI'll sing, \"He knows, He knows.\"", "2 One step I see before me,\n'Tis all I need to see,\nThe light of heaven more brightly shines\nWhen earth's illusions flee;\nAnd sweetly through the silence comes,\nHis loving, \"Trust in Me!\"", "3 Oh, blissful lack of wisdom,\n'Tis blessed not to know;\nHe holds me with His own right hand,\nAnd will not let me go,\nAnd lulls my troubled soul to rest\nIn Him who loves me so.", "4 So on I go not knowing;\nI would not if I might;\nI'd rather walk in the dark with God\nThan go alone in the light;\nI'd rather walk by faith with Him\nThan go alone by sight."]
