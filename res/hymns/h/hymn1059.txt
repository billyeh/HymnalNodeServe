["1 Jesus, keep me near the cross,\nThere a precious fountain,\nFree to all-a healing stream,\nFlows from Calv'ry's mountain.", "chorus In the cross, in the cross,\nBe my glory ever;\nFrom the cross my ransomed soul\nNothing then shall sever.", "2 Near the cross, a trembling soul,\nLove and mercy found me;\nThere the Bright and Morning Star\nSheds its beams around me.", "3 Near the cross! O Lamb of God,\nBring its scenes before me;\nHelp me walk from day to day,\nWith its shadow o'er me.", "4 Near the cross I'll watch and wait,\nHoping, trusting ever,\nTill I see my Savior's face,\nLeave His presence never."]
