["1 For every sin however deep,\nFor every path however steep,\nFor all the weary ones who weep,\nThou art sufficient, Lord.", "2 For every trial great or small,\nFor every care that would appall,\nFor all the stumbling feet that fall,\nThou art sufficient, Lord.", "3 When earthly things bring sweet delight,\nWhen all is well, and skies are bright,\nWhen ease would cloud the heavenly light,\nThou art sufficient, Lord.", "4 When sorrow darkens all the day,\nWhen disappointments bar the way,\nWhen hearts are numb and cannot pray,\nThou art sufficient, Lord.", "5 Whate'er my circumstances be,\nHelp me in all Thy hand to see,\nSo wilt Thou then be unto me,\nMy all-sufficient Lord."]
