["1 In the church of Jesus there is love for you,\nLove most pure and tender, love most deep and true;\nWhy should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh,\nWhen the church of Jesus has a full supply?", "2 In the church of Jesus there is life for you,\nWarm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew;\nWhy should you be fearful, why take anxious thought,\nSince the church of Jesus cares for those He bought?", "3 In the church of Jesus there is work for you;\nSuch as even angels might rejoice to do;\nWhy stand idly sighing for some life work grand,\nWhile the church of Jesus seeks your reaping hand?", "4 In the church of Jesus there's a place for you;\nGlorious, bright, and joyous, right and peaceful too;\nWhy then like a wand'rer, roam with weary pace,\nIf the church of Jesus holds for you a place."]
