["1 Hark! what mean those holy voices\nSweetly sounding in the skies?\nLo! th' angelic host rejoices,\nLoudest hallelujahs rise.", "2 Listen to the wondrous story\nWhich they chant in hymns of joy:\n\"Glory in the highest, glory!\nGlory be to God most high!", "3 \"Peace on earth, good-will from heaven,\nReaching far as man is found;\nSouls redeemed and sins forgiven,\nLoud our golden harps shall sound.", "4 \"Christ is born! the great Anointed!\nHeaven and earth His glory sing;\nOh, receive whom God appointed\nFor your Prophet, Priest, and King!", "5 \"Hasten, mortals, to adore Him,\nLearn His name and taste His joy,\nTill one day ye sing before Him\nGlory be to God most high!\"", "6 Let us learn the wondrous story\nOf our great Redeemer's birth;\nSpread the brightness of His glory,\nTill it cover all the earth."]
