["1 Alas, and did my Savior bleed?\nAnd did my Sovereign die?\nWould He devote that sacred head\nFor such a worm as I?", "chorus At the cross, at the cross where\nI first saw the light,\nAnd the burden of my heart rolled away,\nIt was there by faith I received my sight,\nAnd now I am happy all the day!", "2 Was it for sins that I had done\nHe groaned upon the tree?\nAmazing pity! grace unknown!\nAnd love beyond degree!", "3 Well might the sun in darkness hide,\nAnd shut His glories in,\nWhen Christ, the mighty Maker, died\nFor man, His creature's sin.", "4 Thus might I hide my blushing face\nWhile His dear cross appears.\nDissolve my heart in thankfulness,\nAnd melt mine eyes to tears.", "5 But drops of grief can ne'er repay\nThe debt of love I owe;\nHere, Lord, I give myself away,\n'Tis all that I can do."]
