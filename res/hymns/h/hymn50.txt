["1 Father, Thy Son beloved leads our praise\nAfter the banquet feast is had and done;\nHow dear, how sweet to Thee the praise He leads,\nAnd in His praises joining we are one.", "2 Father, we need no goodness more than Thee,\nNor do we seek a love that's less than Thine;\nHow we adore Thee now that here we know\nThy searchless, uncreated life divine.", "3 Father, within Thy love our love to Thee\nGrows, far transcending all our earthly ties;\nThine own dear love in power leads our hearts\nWhere Thine own presence deeply satisfies.", "4 Father, by joining with Thy Son beloved,\nWe all with gladness praise Thee now again;\nJoyfully feasting on Thy holy love,\nTasting, as sons, the sweetness of Thy name."]
