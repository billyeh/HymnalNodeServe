["1 Christ is risen! Hallelujah!\nRisen our victorious Head;\nSing His praises; Hallelujah!\nChrist is risen from the dead.\nGratefully our hearts adore Him,\nAs His light once more appears;\nBowing down in joy before Him,\nRising up from griefs and tears.", "chorus Christ is risen: \"Hallelujah!\nRisen our victorious Head;\nSing His praises; Hallelujah!\nChrist is risen from the dead.", "2 Christ is risen! All the sadness\nOf His earthly life is o'er;\nThrough the open gates of gladness\nHe returns to life once more;\nDeath and hell before Him bending,\nHe doth rise the Victor now,\nAngels on His steps attending,\nGlory round His wounded brow.", "3 Christ is risen! Henceforth never\nDeath nor hell shall us enthrall;\nWe are Christ's, in Him forever\nWe have triumphed over all;\nAll the doubting and dejection\nOf our trembling hearts have ceased,\n'Tis His day of resurrection;\nLet us rise and keep the feast."]
