["1 'Tis the Church triumphant singing,\nWorthy the Lamb;\nHeav'n throughout with praises ringing,\nWorthy the Lamb.\nThrones and pow'rs before Him bending,\nOdors sweet with voice ascending\nSwell the chorus never ending,\nWorthy the Lamb.", "2 Every kindred, tongue and nation,\nWorthy the Lamb;\nJoin to sing the great salvation,\nWorthy the Lamb.\nLoud as mighty thunders roaring,\nFloods of mighty waters pouring,\nProstrate at His feet adoring,\nWorthy the Lamb.", "3 Harps and songs forever sounding,\nWorthy the Lamb;\nMighty grace o'er sin abounding,\nWorthy the Lamb.\nBy His blood He dearly bought us;\nWand'ring from the fold He sought us,\nAnd to glory safely brought us;\nWorthy the Lamb.", "4 Sing with blest anticipation\nWorthy the Lamb;\nThrough the vale of tribulation,\nWorthy the Lamb.\nSweetest notes, all notes excelling,\nOn the theme forever dwelling,\nStill untold, though ever telling,\nWorthy the Lamb."]
