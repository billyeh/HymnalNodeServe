["1 O blessed life-the heart at rest\nWhen all without tumultuous seems,\nThat trusts a higher will, and deems\nThat higher will, not mine, the best.", "2 O blessed life, the mind that sees,\nWhatever change the years may bring,\nA mercy still in everything,\nAnd shining through all mysteries.", "3 O blessed life, as spirit soars,\nWhen sense of mortal sight is dim,\nBeyond the sense, beyond to Him,\nWhose love unlocks the glorious doors.", "4 O blessed life, heart, mind, and soul,\nFrom self-born aims and wishes free,\nIn all at one with Deity,\nAnd loyal to the Lord's control.", "5 O life, how blessed, how divine,\nHigh life, the earnest of a higher;\nSavior, fulfil my deep desire,\nAnd let this blessed life be mine."]
