["1 He looked for a city and lived in a tent,\nA pilgrim to glory right onward he went;\nGod's promise his solace, so royal his birth,\nNo wonder he sought not the glories of earth.", "chorus City! O city fair!\nGod's dwelling with man to eternity is there.", "2 He looked for a city, his God should prepare;\nNo mansion on earth, could he covet or share,\nFor had not God told him, that royal abode\nAwaited His pilgrims on ending the road.", "3 He looked for a city; if sometimes he sighed\nTo be trudging the road, all earth's glory denied,\nThe thought of that city changed sighing to song,\nFor the road might be rough, but it could not be long.", "4 He looked for a city, his goal, Lord, we share\nAnd know that bright city, which Thou dost prepare\nIs ever our portion, since willing to be\nJust pilgrims with Jesus, our roof a tent tree."]
