["1 Christ the Savior hath ascended,\nTo the heavens far above\nCrowned with glory and with honor,\nBy the Father God in love;\nHe hath made Him Head of all things\nHis supremacy to prove.", "2 From this Christ to God ascended,\nHath the Spirit been outpoured\nPoured upon the Church, His Body\nThat His members be empow'red;\nThus the Lord of all in heaven,\nThru His Church will be adored.", "3 In the flesh by incarnation\nInto man He God hath brought;\nBy His death and resurrection\nInto God He man hath brought;\nGod and man together mingled\nIn Himself is fully wrought.", "4 Now in heaven by ascension,\nHe is seated on the throne;\nAll the lordship, all the headship\nHe Himself doth fully own;\nAnd by pouring out His Spirit\nHe as such might be made known.", "5 By this outpour, His descension,\nOn the Church was realized;\n'Tis by this, that in His Spirit,\nAll the Church He hath baptized;\nThus the baptism of the Spirit,\nWas forever actualized.", "6 Hallelujah, 'tis accomplished\nAnd accomplished once for all!\nHallelujah, we're included\nAll included, great or small!\nPraise Him, He hath sent the Spirit,\nAnd baptized the Church withal!"]
