["1 \"Must I go, and empty-handed,\"\nThus my dear Redeemer meet?\nNot one day of service give Him,\nLay no trophy at His feet?", "chorus \"Must I go, and empty-handed?\"\nMust I meet my Savior so?\nNot one soul with which to greet Him:\nMust I empty-handed go?", "2 Not at death I shrink nor falter,\nFor my Savior saves me now;\nBut to meet Him empty-handed,\nThought of that now clouds my brow.", "3 O the years in sinning wasted;\nCould I but recall them now,\nI would give them to my Savior,\nTo His will I'd gladly bow.", "4 O ye saints, arouse, be earnest,\nUp and work while yet 'tis day;\nEre the night of death o'ertake thee,\nStrive for souls while still you may."]
