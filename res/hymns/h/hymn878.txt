["1 Conquering now and still to conquer,\nRideth a King in His might,\nLeading the host of all the faithful\nInto the midst of the fight;\nSee them with courage advancing,\nClad in their brilliant array,\nShouting the name of their Leader,\nHear them exultingly say:", "chorus Not to the strong is the battle,\nNot to the swift is the race;\nYet to the true and the faithful\nVict'ry is promised through grace.", "2 Conquering now and still to conquer,\nWho is this wonderful King?\nWhence are the armies which He leade\nWhile of His glory they sing?\nHe is our Lord and Redeemer,\nSavior and Monarch divine;\nThey are the stars that forever\nBright in His kingdom will shine.", "3 Conquering now and still to conquer,\nJesus, Thou Ruler of all,\nThrones and their scepters all shall perish,\nCrowns and their splendor shall fall,\nYet shall the armies Thou leadest\nFaithful and true to the last,\nFind in Thy kingdom eternal\nRest, when their warfare is past."]
