["1 O for a thousand tongues to sing\nMy great Redeemer's praise,\nThe glories of my God and King,\nThe triumphs of His grace.", "2 My gracious Master and my God,\nAssist me to proclaim,\nTo spread through all the earth abroad,\nThe honors of Thy name.", "3 Jesus! the name that charms our fears,\nThat bids our sorrows cease;\n'Tis music in the sinner's ears,\n'Tis life, and health, and peace.", "4 His love my heart has captive made,\nHis captive would I be,\nFor He was bound, and scourged and died,\nMy captive soul to free.", "5 He breaks the power of canceled sin,\nHe sets the prisoner free;\nHis blood can make the foulest clean;\nHis blood availed for me.", "6 So now Thy blessed Name I love,\nThy will would e'er be mine.\nHad I a thousand hearts to give,\nMy Lord, they all were Thine!"]
