["1 The Holy Spirit is the seal,\nThe foretaste, earnest, and the pledge.\nHe designates us as God's own\nAnd guarantees our heritage.", "2 'Twas after we believed in Christ,\nThe word of truth, the gospel, heard,\nThe Holy Spirit us did seal\nTo show that we belong to God.", "3 This Spirit as the living seal,\nTo us God's image now imparts;\nConforming us unto the Son,\nHe stamps His image in our hearts.", "4 This Spirit also is the pledge,\nOur earnest and our foretaste true.\nHe witnesses that we are sons,\nWith God's inheritance in view.", "5 'Tis by this Spirit God does spread\nInto our mind, emotion, will;\nBy sealing every inward part,\nHe will our very being fill.", "6 Oh Lord, we would cooperate\nWith all Thy Spirit's inward move;\nThat we'd become Thy masterpiece,\nTh' eternal purpose thus to prove."]
