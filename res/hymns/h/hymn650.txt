["1 O doubting, struggling Christian,\nWhy thus in anguish pray?\nO cease to doubt and struggle,\nThere is a better way.", "chorus O settle it all with Jesus,\nO settle it all today;\nO cease to doubt and struggle,\nO cease to plead and pray;\nO rest in His word forever,\nAnd settle it all today.", "2 Give up thy will to Jesus,\nAnd trust Him though He slay;\nHush all thy fears and questions,\nAnd settle it today.", "3 O soul so tossed with tempest,\nUpon His promise stay;\nCast out faith's strong sheet anchor,\nAnd settle it today.", "4 Lord, I give up the struggle,\nTo Thee commit my way;\nI trust Thy word forever,\nAnd settle it today."]
