["1 What a wondrous fact, I’m crucified with Christ;\nOf my flesh and passion I’m relieved;\nWhat a glorious fact, with Christ, the Lord, I live,\nResurrection life in Him received.", "Chorus On the Cross of Calvary the Lord and I\nWere crucified, were crucified;\nNow in resurrection life with Him I live\nAnd in Him e’er abide."]
