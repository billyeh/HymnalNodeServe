["1 Come in, O come! the door stands open now;\nI knew Thy voice; Lord Jesus, it was Thou.\nThe sun has set long since the storms begin;\n'Tis time for Thee, my Savior, O come in!", "2 Alas, ill-ordered shows the dreary room;\nThe household stuff lies heaped amidst the gloom,\nThe table empty stands, the couch undressed;\nAh, what a welcome for th' Eternal Guest!", "3 Yet welcome, and tonight; this doleful scene\nIs e'en itself my cause to hail Thee in;\nThis dark confusion e'en at once demands\nThine own bright presence, Lord, and ord'ring hands.", "4 I seek no more to alter things, or mend,\nBefore the coming of so great a Friend;\nAll were at best unseemly; and 'twere ill\nBeyond all else to keep Thee waiting still.", "5 Come, not to find, but make this troubled heart\nA dwelling worthy of Thee as Thou art;\nTo chase the gloom, the terror, and the sin:\nCome, all Thyself, yea come, Lord Jesus, in!"]
