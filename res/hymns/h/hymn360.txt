["1 O Everlasting Light,\nShine graciously within;\nBrightest of all on earth that's bright,\nCome, shine away my sin.", "2 O Everlasting Truth,\nTruest of all that's true,\nSure guide of erring age or youth,\nLead me, and teach me too.", "3 O Everlasting Strength,\nUphold me in the way;\nBring me, in spite of foes, at length\nTo joy and light of day.", "4 O Everlasting Love,\nWellspring of grace and peace,\nPour down Thy fulness from above,\nBid doubt and trouble cease.", "5 O Everlasting Rest,\nLift off life's load of care;\nRelieve, revive this burdened breast\nAnd every sorrow bear.", "6 Thou art in heaven our all,\nOur all on earth art Thou;\nUpon Thy glorious Name we call,\nLord Jesus, bless us now."]
