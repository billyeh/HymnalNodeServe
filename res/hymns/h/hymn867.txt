["1 As members of the Body,\nChrist we would manifest\nEach learning how to function,\nHis fulness to express;\nWe would not be spectators,\nBut each as members move\nNone bringing death or damage,\nBut each our profit prove.", "2 As in a team we'd never,\nAct independently\nBut in coordination\nEach would dependent be;\nNot acting by our choosing,\nBut following the flow\nDistraction never bringing\nThe Spirit's way we'd know.", "3 On Christ we here would focus\nNo other center make;\nWith Christ in sweet communion,\nHis riches to partake.\nHe is our Head and content\nHis Body we express;\nWhate'er we do while meeting,\nHimself must manifest.", "4 Built up in love together\nNot one would criticize;\nTo perfect one another\nWe all would exercise.\nEach one from self delivered\nThe natural life forsakes;\nIn grace each trained in spirit,\nThe Body-life partakes."]
