["1 The Lord of all has shown His plan\nUnto each faithful one,\nWho leaves behind the worldly things\nAs virgins for His Son.\nTo be His Bride we must match Him,\nWithin and outwardly;\nTo be this one who matches Him,\nEnjoy Him constantly.", "2 Like virgins who so single are,\nThey love the Groom so much,\nThey in His presence ever stay-\nLord Jesus, make us such.\nLord, make us those who are so wise,\nWho gain You every day,\nThe wise ones who enjoy the feast,\nWho all the price will pay.", "3 The virgins are mature in life,\nThey grow so normally.\nThey daily eat and drink the Lord,\nTheir lot eternally.\nOur need today is growth in life,\nChrist's inward work indeed;\nNot knowledge, teachings, gifts, nor pow'r-\nBut life is all we need.", "4 Lord, as the seed of life within,\nGrow more in us each day;\nBy spreading from our deepest part,\nGain us in every way.\nLord, strengthen Thou our inner man;\nMake home in all our heart.\nFill us completely with Thyself\nIn every inward part."]
