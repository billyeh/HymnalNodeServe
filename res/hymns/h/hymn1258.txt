["1 Oh, how lovable, how precious\nAre Thy local churches, Lord!\nMy soul longeth, even fainteth\nFor the courts of Thine abode;\n'Tis my heart's deep thirst and longing\nAnd my spirit deeply sighs;\nFellowship among the churches-\nFor this my whole being cries.", "2 Blessed is the man whose heart, to\nZion, is an open way;\nHe's the one whose strength is in Thee;\nHe will praise Thee all the day.\nIn communion with the churches,\nTrusting Thee, Thy praise he sings;\nPassing through the weeping valley,\nIt becomes a place of springs.", "3 One day spent among Thy churches,\nBetter than a thousand is!\nEven to the lowest member,\nSun and shield Jehovah is.\nGrace and glory, every good thing,\nOn us now He doth outpour;\nBlessed is that man who dwelleth\nIn the churches evermore."]
