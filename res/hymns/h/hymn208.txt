["1 O Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord!\nForgive me if I say,\nFor very love, Thy sacred name\nA thousand times a day.", "chorus O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;\nI rest in Thee, whate'er betide;\nThy gracious smile is my reward;\nI love, I love Thee, Lord!", "2 I love Thee so I know not how\nMy transports to control;\nThy love is like a burning fire\nWithin my very soul.", "3 For Thou to me art all in all;\nMy honor and my wealth;\nMy heart's desire, my body's strength,\nMy soul's eternal health.", "4 Burn, burn, O love, within my heart,\nBurn fiercely night and day,\nTill all the dross of earthly loves\nIs burned, and burned away.", "5 O light in darkness, joy in grief,\nO heaven's life on earth;\nJesus, my love, my treasure, who\nCan tell what Thou art worth?", "6 What limit is there to this love?\nThy flight, where wilt Thou stay?\nOn, on! our Lord is sweeter far\nToday than yesterday."]
