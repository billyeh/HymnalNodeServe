["1 Buried with Christ, and raised with Him too;\nWhat is there left for me to do?\nSimply to cease from struggling and strife,\nSimply to walk in newness of life.\nGlory be to God!", "2 Risen with Christ, my glorious Head,\nHoliness now the pathway I tread,\nBeautiful thought, while walking therein:\nHe that is dead is freed from sin.\nGlory be to God!", "3 Living with Christ, who dieth no more,\nFollowing Christ, who goeth before;\nI am from bondage utterly freed,\nReckoning self as dead indeed.\nGlory be to God!", "4 Living for Christ, my members I yield,\nServants to God, for evermore sealed,\nNot under law, I'm now under grace,\nSin is dethroned, and Christ takes its place.\nGlory be to God!", "5 Growing in Christ; no more shall be named\nThings of which now I'm truly ashamed,\nFruit unto holiness will I bear,\nLife evermore, the end I shall share.\nGlory be to God!"]
