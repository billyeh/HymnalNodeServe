["1 Come, every soul by sin oppressed,\nThere's mercy with the Lord;\nAnd He will surely give you rest\nBy trusting in His Word.", "chorus Only trust Him! Only trust Him!\nOnly trust Him now!\nHe will save you! He will save you!\nHe will save you now!", "2 For Jesus shed His precious blood\nRich blessings to bestow;\nPlunge now into the crimson flood\nThat washeth white as snow.", "3 Yes, Jesus is the Truth, the Way,\nThat leads you into rest;\nBelieve in Him without delay,\nAnd you are fully blest.", "4 Come then, and join the holy band,\nAnd on to glory go;\nIn Christ's redemption take your stand,\nAnd all His goodness know."]
