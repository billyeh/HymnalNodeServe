["1 Jesus, Thou Joy of loving hearts,\nThou Fount of life, Thou Light of men,\nFrom the best bliss that earth imparts,\nWe turn unfilled to Thee again.", "2 Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood;\nThou savest those that on Thee call;\nTo them that seek Thee, Thou art good,\nTo them that find Thee, all in all!", "3 We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread,\nAnd long to feast upon Thee still;\nWe drink of Thee, the Fountain-head,\nAnd thirst our souls from Thee to fill!", "4 Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,\nWhere'er our changeful lot is cast;\nGlad when Thy gracious smile we see,\nBlest, when our faith can hold Thee fast.", "5 O Lord, be Thou our strength and stay!\nMake all our moments calm and bright,\nChase all dark thoughts of sin away,\nShed o'er us here Thy holy light."]
