["1 Jesus shall reign where'er the sun\nDoth his successive journeys run;\nHis Kingdom stretch from shore to shore,\nTill moons shall wax and wane no more.", "2 To Him shall endless prayer be made.\nAnd princes throng to crown His head,\nHis name like sweet perfume shall rise\nWith every morning sacrifice.", "3 People and realms of every tongue\nDwell on His love with sweetest song;\nAnd infant voices shall proclaim\nTheir early blessings on His name.", "4 Blessings abound where'er He reigns:\nThe prisoner leaps to lose his chains,\nThe weary find eternal rest,\nAnd all the sons of want are blest.", "5 Where He displays His healing power\nDeath and the curse are known no more;\nIn Him the tribes of Adam boast\nMore blessings than their father lost.", "6 Let every creature rise and bring\nPeculiar honors to our King;\nAngels descend with songs again,\nAnd earth repeat the loud Amen."]
