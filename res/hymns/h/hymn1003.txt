["1 Why should I worry, doubt and fear?\nHas God not caused His Son to bear,\nMy sins upon the tree?\nThe debt that Christ for me has paid\nWould God another mind have made,\nTo claim again from me?", "2 Redemption full the Lord has made\nAnd all my debts has fully paid\nFrom law to set me free.\nI fear not for the wrath of God\nFor I've been sprinkled with His blood\nIt wholly covers me.", "3 For me forgiveness He has gained\nAnd full acquittal was obtained\nAll debts of sin are paid;\nGod would not have His claim on two\nFirst on His Son, my Surety true\nAnd then upon me laid.", "4 So now I have full peace and rest\nMy Savior Christ hath done the best,\nAnd set me wholly free;\nBy His all-efficacious blood,\nI ne'er could be condemned by God\nFor He has died for me!"]
