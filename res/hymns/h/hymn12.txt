["1 O God, Thou art the source of life\nDivine, and rich and free!\nAs living water flowing out,\nUnto eternity!", "2 In love Thou in the Son didst flow,\nAmong the human race;\nThou dost as Spirit also flow,\nWithin us thru Thy grace.", "3 Though we in sin and wickedness,\nWent far from Thee apace\nYet in the Son Thou didst redeem\nBestowing life and grace.", "4 Though we have often slighted Thee\nThy Spirit often grieved\nYet Thou dost still as Spirit come,\nAs life to be received.", "5 Thou as the Spirit in the Son,\nHast mingled heretofore;\nThou wilt thru fellowship anoint,\nAnd increase more and more.", "6 The love of God, the grace of Christ\nThe Spirit's flowing free\nEnable us God's wealth to share,\nThru all eternity.", "7 The Father, Son, and Spirit-one\nSo richly care for us;\nThy love with one accord we sing,\nAnd e'er would praise Thee thus."]
