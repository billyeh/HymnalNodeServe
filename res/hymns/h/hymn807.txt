["1 Open my eyes that I may see\nGlimpses of truth Thou hast for me;\nPlace in my hands the wonderful key\nThat shall unclasp and set me free.", "chorus Silently now I wait for Thee,\nReady, my God, Thy will to see;\nOpen my eyes, illumine me,\nSpirit Divine!", "2 Open my ears that I may hear\nVoices of truth Thou sendest clear;\nAnd while the wave notes fall on my ear,\nEverything false will disappear.", "3 Open my mouth and let me bear\nTidings of mercy everywhere;\nOpen my heart and let me prepare\nLove with Thy children thus to share.", "4 Open my mind that I may read\nMore of Thy love in word and deed;\nWhat shall I fear while yet Thou dost lead?\nOnly for light from Thee I plead."]
