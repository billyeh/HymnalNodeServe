["1 I stand amazed in the presence\nOf Jesus the Nazarene,\nAnd wonder how He could love me,\nA sinner condemned, unclean.", "chorus How marvelous! How wonderful!\nAnd my song shall ever be:\nHow marvelous! How wonderful!\nIs my Savior's love for me!", "2 For me it was in the garden,\nHe prayed: \"\"Not my will, but Thine.\"\nHe had no tears for His own griefs,\nBut sweat-drops of blood for mine.", "3 In pity angels beheld Him,\nAnd came from the world of light\nTo strengthen Him in the sorrows\nHe bore for my soul that night.", "4 He took my sins and my sorrows,\nHe made them His very own;\nHe bore the burden to Calv'ry,\nAnd suffered, and died alone.", "5 When with the ransomed in glory\nHis face I at last shall see,\n'Twill be my joy through the ages\nTo sing of His love for me."]
