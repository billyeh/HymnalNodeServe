["1 There is a green hill far away,\nWithout a city wall,\nWhere the dear Lord was crucified,\nWho died to save us all.", "chorus Oh, dearly, dearly has He loved,\nAnd died our sins to bear;\nWe trust in His redeeming blood,\nAnd life eternal share.", "2 We may not know, we cannot tell,\nWhat pains He had to bear;\nBut we believe it was for us\nHe hung and suffered there.", "3 He died that we might be forgiven,\nHe died to make us good,\nThat we might from our sins be freed,\nSaved by His precious blood.", "4 There was no other good enough\nTo pay the price of sin,\nHe only could divine life give\nAnd dwell Himself within."]
