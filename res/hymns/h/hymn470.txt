["1 Father, Son and Holy Ghost,\nOne in Three, and Three in One,\nAs by the celestial host,\nLet Thy will on earth be done;\nPraise by all to Thee be giv'n,\nGlorious Lord of earth and heav'n!", "2 Vilest of the sinful race,\nLo, I answer to Thy call:\nMeanest vessel of Thy grace,\nGrace divinely free for all;\nLo, I come to do Thy will,\nAll Thy counsel to fulfil.", "3 If so poor a worm as I,\nMay to Thy great glory live,\nAll my actions sanctify,\nAll my words and thoughts receive;\nClaim me for Thy service, claim\nAll I have, and all I am.", "4 Take my soul and body's powers,\nTake my mem'ry, mind, and will;\nAll my goods and all my hours,\nAll I know, and all I feel;\nAll I think, or speak, or do;\nTake my heart, but make it new.", "5 Now, O God, Thine own I am,\nNow I give Thee back Thine own:\nFreedom, friends, and health, and fame,\nConsecrate to Thee alone;\nThine I live, thrice happy I;\nHappier still when Thine I die."]
