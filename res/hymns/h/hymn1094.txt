["1 Lo, the nations all assemble\nAnd imagine vanity,\nKings and princes plot together\n'Gainst the Lord in unity.\n\"Let us break their bonds asunder,\nCast away their cords from us.\"\n'Gainst the Lord and His Anointed\nWorldly rulers counsel thus.", "2 He who sitteth in the heavens\nIn contempt will laugh at them,\nVex them in His fierce displeasure,\nTerrifying all such men.\nYet upon the hill of Zion\nGod has His anointed King-\nThis is God's own declaration,\nAll the kings admonishing.", "3 Now 'tis Christ, 'tis God's Anointed,\nWho declares the Lord's decree:\n\"Thou'rt my Son (in resurrection),\nThis day I've begotten Thee.\nAll the nations I will give Thee\nFor Thine own inheritance.\nThou shalt dash them into pieces\nIn Thy kingly excellence.\"", "4 Now be wise, O be instructed,\nAll ye rulers of the earth,\nFear the Lord, rejoice with trembling,\nServe the only One of worth.\nKiss the Son, lest He be angry\nAnd ye perish in the way.\n\"All who trust in Him are blessed,\"\nAll who trust in Him will say.", "5 Lord, we praise Thee, we have seen Him-\nThy unique Anointed One-\nAnd from vanity repenting,\nWe in love have kissed Thy Son.\n\"All who trust in Him are blessed\"-\nNot \"all those who keep the law.\"\nIn that risen One believing,\nWe are blest forevermore."]
