["1 To Calv'ry let our eyes be turned,\nWith Calv'ry love our hearts be burned;\nFor there in Calv'ry's awful hour,\nLove conquered sin and Satan's pow'r.", "2 Lord, turn our gaze upon Thy Cross,\nCounting all else not gain but loss;\nFor this we pray, this is our plea-\nLord, keep our eyes on Calvary."]
