["1 In Revelation chapter one\nGod gives a vision of the Son,\nOf Him who was and is to come;\nOh, let us to this One now come.", "2 In spirit hear His trumpet voice;\nWe must be turned to see His choice-\nThe seven lampstands golden fair;\nThe Son of Man is walking there.", "3 The great high priestly robe He wears,\nFor every church He fully cares:\nHe trims the lamp, the oil supplies;\nHe makes them burn, flames in His eyes.", "4 A golden girdle on His breast-\nHis work is done, and from His rest\nHe unto all the churches pours\nHimself in love, the treasure store.", "5 His head, His hair is white as wool-\nThe ancient One with youth is full.\nHis face is shining as the sun\nTo burn and lighten every one.", "6 Oh, when this living One we see,\nWe'll fall as dead, we'll finished be.\nBut then the Lord His comfort gives-\nHe once was dead, but now He lives.", "7 Let every church just love Him more\nHis riches then He will outpour.\nAll other loves now lay aside;\nLet's take this Jesus, none beside."]
