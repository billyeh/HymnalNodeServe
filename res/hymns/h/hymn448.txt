["1 You have longed for sweet peace, and for faith to increase,\nAnd have earnestly, fervently prayed;\nBut you cannot have rest, or be perfectly blest,\nUntil all on the altar is laid.", "chorus Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?\nYour heart, does the Spirit control?\nYou can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest,\nAs you yield Him your body and soul.", "2 Would you walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,\nAnd have peace and contentment alway;\nYou must do His sweet will to be free from all ill;\nOn the altar your all you must lay.", "3 Oh, we never can know what the Lord will bestow\nOf the blessings for which we have prayed,\nTill our body and soul He doth fully control,\nAnd our all on the altar is laid.", "4 Who can tell all the love He will send from above!\nOh, how happy our heart will be made!\nOh, what fellowship sweet we shall share at His feet,\nWhen our all on the altar is laid!"]
