["1 Oh, trust thyself to Jesus\nWhen conscious of thy sin,\nIts heavy weight upon thee,\nIts mighty pow'r within:\nThen is the hour for pleading\nHis finished work for thee:\nThen is the time for singing,\nHis blood was shed for me.", "2 Oh, trust thyself to Jesus\nWhen tempted to transgress,\nBy word or look of anger,\nOr thought of bitterness:\nThen is the hour for claiming\nThy Lord to fight for thee:\nThen is the time for singing,\nHe doth deliver me.", "3 Oh, trust thyself to Jesus\nWhen daily cares perplex,\nAnd trifles seem so mighty\nThy inner soul to vex:\nThen is the hour for grasping\nHis hand who walked the sea:\nThen is the time for singing\nHe makes it calm for me.", "4 Oh, trust thyself to Jesus\nWhen thou art wearied sore,\nWhen head or hand refuses\nTo think or labor more:\nThen is the hour for leaning\nUpon the Master's breast:\nThen is the time for singing,\nMy Savior gives me rest."]
