["1 Blest Father of glory, we worship:\nThy greatness surpasses our praise;\nWe bless Thee Thy Spirit within us\nGives pow'r to these heavenly lays.", "2 We think of the Man in Thy presence,\nSet down there, exalted as Head;\nOnce raised by the might of Thy power,\nWhen numbered along with the dead.", "3 We think of the glory that chose us,\n'Twas Thine, blessed Father, the Source;\nThe glory of love that redeemed us\nThrough Jesus, the Man of Thy choice.", "4 As marked out beforehand for sonship,\nWe praise now the glory of grace\nAnd bow in Thy presence and worship,\nAs conscious, in Christ, of our place."]
