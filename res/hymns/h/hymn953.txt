["1 Our Lord is now rejected,\nAnd by the world disowned,\nBy the many still neglected,\nAnd by the few enthroned;\nBut soon He'll come in glory!\nThe hour is drawing nigh,\nFor the crowning day is coming\nBy-and-by.", "chorus O the crowning day is coming,\nIs coming by-and-by,\nWhen our Lord shall come in power\nAnd glory from on high.\nO the glorious sight will gladden\nEach waiting, watchful eye,\nIn the crowning day that's coming\nBy-and-by.", "2 The heavens shall glow with splendor,\nBut brighter far than they,\nThe saints shall shine in glory,\nAs Christ shall them array.\nThe beauty of the Savior\nShall dazzle every eye,\nIn the crowning day that's coming\nBy-and-by.", "3 Our pain shall then be over,\nWe'll sin and sigh no more,\nBehind us all of sorrow,\nAnd naught but joy before,\nA joy in our Redeemer,\nAs we to Him are nigh,\nIn the crowning day that's coming\nBy-and-by.", "4 Let all that look for hasten\nThe coming joyful day,\nBy earnest consecration,\nTo walk the narrow way;\nBy gathering in the lost ones,\nFor whom our Lord did die,\nFor the crowning day that's coming\nBy-and-by."]
