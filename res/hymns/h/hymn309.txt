["1 What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought\nSince Jesus came into my heart!\nI have light in my soul for which long I had sought,\nSince Jesus came into my heart!", "chorus Since Jesus came into my heart!\nSince Jesus came into my heart!\nFloods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll,\nSince Jesus came into my heart!", "2 I have ceased from my wand'ring and going astray,\nSince Jesus came into my heart!\nAnd my sins which were many are all washed away,\nSince Jesus came into my heart!", "3 I'm possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure,\nSince Jesus came into my heart!\nAnd no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure,\nSince Jesus came into my heart!", "4 There's a light in the valley of death now for me,\nSince Jesus came into my heart!\nAnd the gates of the City beyond I can see,\nSince Jesus came into my heart!", "5 I shall go there to dwell in that City I know,\nSince Jesus came into my heart!\nAnd I'm happy, so happy as onward I go,\nSince Jesus came into my heart!"]
