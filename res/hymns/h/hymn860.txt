["1 Blest be the tie that binds\nOur hearts in Christian love;\nThe fellowship our spirit finds\nIs like to that above.", "2 Before our Father's throne,\nWe pour our ardent prayers;\nOur fears, our hopes, our aims are one-\nOur comforts and our cares.", "3 We share our mutual woes;\nOur mutual burdens bear;\nAnd often for each other flows\nThe sympathizing tear.", "4 When we asunder part,\nIt gives us inward pain;\nBut we shall still be joined in heart,\nAnd hope to meet again.", "5 From sorrow, toil, and pain,\nAnd sin we shall be free;\nAnd perfect love and oneness reign\nThrough all eternity."]
