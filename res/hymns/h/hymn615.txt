["1 Begin the day with God!\nHe is thy Sun and Day!\nHis is the radiance of thy dawn;\nTo Him address thy lay.", "2 Sing a new song at morn!\nJoin the glad woods and hills;\nJoin the fresh winds and seas and plains,\nJoin the bright flowers and rills.", "3 Sing thy first song to God!\nNot to thy fellow men;\nNot to the creatures of His hand,\nBut to the glorious One.", "4 Take thy first walk with God!\nLet Him go forth with thee;\nBy stream, or sea, or mountain path,\nSeek still His company.", "5 Thy first transaction be\nWith God Himself above;\nSo shall thy business prosper well\nAnd all the day be love."]
