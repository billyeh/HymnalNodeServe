["1 Jesus, the name high over all,\nIn hell, or earth, or sky:\nAngels and men before it fall,\nAnd devils fear and fly.", "2 Jesus, the name to sinners dear,\nThe name to sinners giv'n;\nIt scatters all their guilty fear,\nIt brings them peace of heav'n.", "3 Jesus the prisoner's fetters breaks,\nAnd bruises Satan's head;\nPow'r into strengthless souls He speaks,\nAnd life into the dead.", "4 Oh, that the world might taste and see,\nThe riches of His grace!\nThe arms of love that compass me,\nWould all mankind embrace.", "5 Him as my righteousness I show,\nHis saving truth proclaim:\n'Tis all my business here below,\nTo cry, Behold the Lamb!", "6 Happy, if with my latest breath\nI may but gasp His name:\nPreach Him to all, and cry in death,\n\"Behold, behold the Lamb!\""]
