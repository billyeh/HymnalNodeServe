["1 Christ delivered me when bound,\nAnd when bleeding, healed my wound;\nSought me wand'ring, set me right,\nTurned my darkness into light.", "2 Can a woman's tender care\nCease towards the child she bare?\nYes, she may forgetful be;\nYet will He remember me.", "3 His is an unchanging love,\nHigher than the heights above;\nDeeper than the depths beneath,\nFree and faithful, strong as death.", "4 I shall see His glory soon,\nWhen the work of grace is done;\nPartner of His throne shall be;\nSuch is His great love for me!", "5 Lord, it is my chief complaint\nThat my love is weak and faint;\nYet I love Thee, and adore:\nOh for grace to love Thee more."]
