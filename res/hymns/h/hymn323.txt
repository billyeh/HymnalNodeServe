["1 I heard the voice of Jesus say,\n\"Come unto Me, and rest;\nLay down, thou weary one, lay down\nThy head upon My breast.\"\nI came to Jesus as I was,\nWeary, and worn, and sad;\nI found in Him a resting-place,\nAnd He has made me glad.", "2 I heard the voice of Jesus say,\n\"Behold, I freely give\nThe living water: \"thirsty one,\nStoop down, and drink, and live.\"\nI came to Jesus, and I drank\nOf that life-giving stream;\nMy thirst was quenched, my soul revived,\nAnd now I live in Him.", "3 I heard the voice of Jesus say,\n\"I am this dark world's Light;\nLook unto Me, thy morn shall rise,\nAnd all thy day be bright.\"\nI looked to Jesus, and I found\nIn Him my Star, my Sun;\nAnd in that Light of life I'll walk\nTill trav'lling days are done."]
