["1 Down in Babylon, in captivity,\nOh, the Lord has stirred our spirit up!\nScattered everywhere, without unity,\nOh, the Lord has stirred our spirit up!\nStirred up! Stirred up!\nOh, the Lord has stirred our spirit up!", "2 Up from Babylon, where the sects abound,\nFrom division we must all rise up!\nBrothers, Babylon's not the proper ground;\nFrom division we must all rise up!\nRise up! Rise up!\nFrom division we must all rise up!", "3 To Jerusalem, from captivity,\nGod is with us, let us all go up!\nTo the one unique ground of unity,\nGod is with us, let us all go up!\nGo up! Go up!\nGod is with us, let us all go up!", "4 Platters full of Christ, bowls with Spirit filled-\nAll the vessels of the Lord bring up!\nBring them to the church as the Lord has willed-\nAll the vessels of the Lord bring up!\nBring up! Bring up!\nAll the vessels of the Lord bring up!", "5 In Jerusalem, chosen of the Lord,\nNow the temple of the Lord build up!\nServe with all the saints, share in one accord,\nNow the temple of the Lord build up!\nBuild up! Build up!\nNow the temple of the Lord build up!"]
