["1 No more in earthen vessels\nGod's treasure then shall be,\nBut in unclouded beauty\nThou, Lord, wilt shine thru me.", "2 Afar thru that gold vessel\nGod's glory shineth bright;\nThere'll be no need of sunshine,\nFor God will be the light.", "3 With Christ, the Stone most precious,\nGod's city shall be fair;\nAnd He shall shine as jasper\nIn cloudless glory there:", "4 Undimmed in that great vessel,\nThe glory of that light,\nIllum'ning with its fulness\nThe earth in radiance bright.", "5 All in His new creation\nGod's glory there shall see;\nThe vessel for that shining\nThe Lamb's own Bride shall be:", "6 A golden vessel glorious,\nThat all who see adore\nGod in the Lamb in glory\nExpressed forevermore."]
