["1 Come, let us join our cheerful songs,\nAnd thus approach the throne;\nHad we ten thousand thousand tongues,\nOur theme of joy's but one:", "2 \"Worthy the Lamb that's gone on high,\nTo be exalted thus!\"\n\"Worthy the Lamb that died!\" we cry,\n\"For He was slain for us.\"", "3 Jesus is worthy to receive\nHonor and pow'r divine;\nAnd blessings more than we can give\nBe, Lord, forever Thine.", "4 Soon shall the saints, exalted high,\nA glorious anthem raise,\nAnd all that dwell beneath the sky\nSpeak forth Thine endless praise.", "5 Redeemed creation join in one,\nT'adore the sacred name\nOf Him that sits upon the throne,\nAnd to exalt the Lamb."]
