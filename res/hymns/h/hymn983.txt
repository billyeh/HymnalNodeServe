["1 There is a stream which issues forth\nFrom God's eternal throne\nAnd from the Lamb, a living stream,\nClear as the crystal stone.\nIn it doth grow the tree of life,\nIt makes the ransomed sing:\nIts living draught revives the heart;\nHence all the joys do spring.", "2 Such joys as are unspeakable,\nAnd full of glory too;\nSuch splendid riches, meat and drink,\nAs worldlings do not know.\nEye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard,\nFor fancy 'tis concealed,\nWhat Thou, Lord, hast laid up for Thine\nAnd hast to me revealed.", "3 I feel Thy touch, I hear Thy voice,\nI taste Thy sweetest grace;\nMy soul doth leap: \"but, oh, that I\nMay see Thee face to face!\nThen with the saints my soul shall feast\nOn joys that always last:\nBlest be my God, the God of joy,\nThat gives here such a taste!"]
