["1 Lord, we thank Thee for the table\nWith the bread and with the wine;\nAt this table we enjoy Thee,\nAs the feast of love divine.\nWe partake the bread, the emblem,\nOf Thy body giv'n for us;\nAnd we share the wine, the symbol,\nOf Thy blood Thou shedd'st for us.", "chorus Lo, the holy table!\nWith the sacred symbols;\nIts significance in figure,\nIs unsearchable!", "2 By the death of Thy redemption\nThat Thy life Thou may impart\nE'en Thyself to us Thou gavest,\nThat we share in all Thou art.\nBy the bread and wine partaking\nWe Thy death display and prove;\nEating, drinking of Thyself, Lord\nWe remember Thee with love.", "3 By this bread which signifieth,\nThy one body mystical\nWe commune with all Thy members,\nIn one bond identical.\nBy this holy cup of blessing\nCup of wine which now we bless\nOf Thy blood we have communion,\nWith all those who faith possess.", "4 Thou art our eternal portion\nHere we take a sweet foretaste;\nWe are waiting for Thy kingdom\nAnd Thy coming now we haste.\nAt Thy coming, in Thy kingdom\nWith all saints that overcome\nWe anew will feast upon Thee,\nAnd Thy loving Bride become."]
