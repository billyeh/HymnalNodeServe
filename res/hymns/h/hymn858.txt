["1 All praise to our redeeming Lord,\nWho joins us by His grace,\nAnd bids us, each to each restored,\nTogether seek His face,\nTogether seek His face.", "2 He bids us build each other up;\nAnd, gathered into one,\nTo our high calling's glorious hope,\nWe hand in hand go on,\nWe hand in hand go on.", "3 The gift which He on one bestows,\nWe all delight to prove;\nThe grace through every vessel flows,\nIn purest streams of love,\nIn purest streams of love.", "4 We all partake the joy of one;\nThe common peace we feel;\nA peace to worldly minds unknown,\nA joy unspeakable,\nA joy unspeakable.", "5 And if our fellowship below\nIn Christ yet be so sweet,\nWhat height of rapture shall we know,\nWhen round His throne we meet,\nWhen round His throne we meet!"]
