["1 'Twas a day in early springtime,\nBy an ancient wayside well,\nEliezer paused to rest his camel train.\nHe had found a bride for Isaac\nEre the evening shadows fell,\nFor his weary journey had not been in vain.", "chorus Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall.\nDon't you hear the Eliezer call?\nThere's going to be a wedding,\nAnd our joy will soon begin,\nIn the evening when the camel train comes in.", "2 So he took the fair Rebekah,\nDressed in jewels rich and rare,\nQuickly to her waiting bridegroom far away.\nWhere Rebekah loved her Isaac,\nAnd he loved Rebekah fair;\nOh, it must have been a happy wedding day.", "3 Now the blessed Holy Spirit,\nFrom our Father God above,\nHas come down to earth to find a worthy Bride.\nFor our Isaac over yonder\nHas prepared His tents of love,\nAnd He wants His fair Rebekah by His side.", "4 We have left our kinfolk gladly;\nWe have bade the world goodbye.\nWe've been called to be His pure and spotless Bride;\nWhere we'll soon behold our Jesus\nIn that blest eternity-\nWhat a happy, happy wedding that will be!"]
