["1 Come, let us sing the song of songs,\nThe saints of old began the strain,\nThe blessing which to Christ belongs:\nWorthy the Lamb, for He was slain!", "2 Slain to redeem us by His blood,\nTo cleanse from every sinful stain;\nAnd make us kings and priests to God;\nWorthy the Lamb, for He was slain!", "3 Long as we live, and should we die,\nAnd while in light with Him we reign,\nThis song our song of songs shall be:\nWorthy the Lamb, for He was slain!"]
