["1 Savior, lead me, this I pray\nIn the Spirit all the day;\nWalking in the light of life\nI would cease from all my strife.", "chorus Lead me, lead me\nSavior, lead me, this I pray;\nDeeply in the stream of life\nLead me, Savior, in Thy way.", "2 Thou as life in me indeed\nBy the law of life dost lead;\nWhen Thou reignest in Thy might\nAll my darkness turns to light.", "3 Liberating Spirit, Thou\nWholly regulate me now;\nThus my mind Thou wilt renew,\nAnd Thy will I'll fully know."]
