["1 O what a miracle, my Lord\nThat I'm in Thee and Thou in me\nThat Thou and I are really one;\nO what a wondrous mystery!", "2 For me Thy body Thou didst give\nThat I may ever share in Thee;\nFor me Thy precious blood was shed\nThat from my sins I might be free.", "3 By resurrection Thou didst change,\nThy form and as the Spirit come;\nThou wouldst that I be filled with Thee,\nThat all Thy riches mine become.", "4 Now as the symbols we behold\nThy loving self we see anew;\nWe thank Thee for Thy heart's desire,\nAs all Thy travail we review.", "5 We eat the bread and drink the wine\nAnd to Thy sweetness we are led;\nIn spirit each receiving Thee\nOur spirits with Thyself are fed.", "6 We long to eat and drink e'en more\nTo take Thyself in spirit thus\nTill Thou shalt all our being fill,\nAnd true remembrance have from us."]
