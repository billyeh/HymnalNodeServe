["1 We gather together to eat the Lord's supper:\nBy eating and drinking, our oneness we show.\nHis presence possessing, our oneness confessing,\n'Tis thus we eat and drink, and His blessing we know.", "2 We're eating the bread of His body once broken\nAs now we're enjoying His Body made one:\nOne loaf on the table-one Body, we're able\nTo testify to all that the Lord's made us one.", "3 We also are drinking the cup of His blessing,\nThe church's true fellowship of the Lord's blood;\nRedeemed by believing, all saints we're receiving,\nAll those who through redemption have come unto God.", "4 Oh, what can we say now except \"Hallelujah!\"\nFor such a reality given to us.\nThy blood we're employing, Thy Body enjoying;\nThus Thou wilt have the church for Thyself glorious."]
