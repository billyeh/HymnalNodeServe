["1 Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious;\nSee the Man of sorrows now;\nFrom the fight returned victorious,\nEvery knee to Him shall bow;\nCrown Him! Crown Him!\nCrown Him! Crown Him!\nCrowns become the Victor's brow.", "2 Crown the Savior! Angels, crown Him!\nRich the trophies Jesus brings;\nIn the seat of pow'r enthrone Him,\nWhile the vault of heaven rings:\nCrown Him! Crown Him!\nCrown Him! Crown Him!\nCrown the Savior King of kings.", "3 Sinners in derision crowned Him,\nMocking thus the Savior's claim;\nSaints and angels crowd around Him,\nOwn His title, praise His name:\nCrown Him! Crown Him!\nCrown Him! Crown Him!\nSpread abroad the Victor's fame.", "4 Hark! those bursts of acclamation!\nHark! those loud triumphant chords!\nJesus takes the highest station;\nO what joy the sight affords!\nCrown Him! Crown Him!\nCrown Him! Crown Him!\nKing of kings, and Lord of lords!"]
