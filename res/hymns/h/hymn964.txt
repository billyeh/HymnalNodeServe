["1 'Midst the darkness, storm, and sorrow,\nOne bright gleam I see;\nWell I know the blessed morrow\nChrist will come for me.\n'Midst the peace, the joy, the glory\nAnd the light, God's own,\nChrist for me is watching, waiting,\nWaiting 'til I come.", "2 Long the blessed Guide has led me,\nBy the desert road;\nNow I see the coming splendor,\nSplendor of my God.\nThere amidst the love and glory\nHe is waiting yet;\nOn His hands a name is graven\nHe can ne'er forget.", "3 Who is this, who comes to meet me,\nOn the desert way,\nAs the Morning Star foretelling\nGod's unclouded day?\nHe it is who came to win me,\nOn the cross of shame;\nIn His glory well I know Him,\nEvermore the same.", "4 O the blessed joy of meeting,\nAll the desert past;\nO the wondrous words of greeting,\nHe shall speak at last!\nHe and I together ent'ring\nThe fair realm above;\nHe and I together sharing\nAll the Father's love.", "5 Where no shade nor stain can enter,\nNor the gold be dim,\nIn His holiness unsullied,\nI shall walk with Him.\nMeet companion then for Jesus,\nFrom Him, for Him, made-\nGlory of God's grace forever\nThere in me displayed.", "6 He who in His hour of sorrow\nBore the curse alone;\nI who through the lonely desert\nTrod where He had gone;\nHe and I, in that bright glory,\nOne deep joy shall share-\nMine, to be forever with Him;\nHis, that I am there."]
