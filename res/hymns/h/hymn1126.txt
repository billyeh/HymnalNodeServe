["1 O Jesus Lord, we come to Thee,\nThy presence to enjoy;\nOur entrance now with boldness is,\nAs we Thy blood employ.\nNot by our merit do we stand,\nNor in our righteousness,\nThy blood and righteousness we need;\nTheir worth we now confess.", "2 Thy judgments, Lord, we must admit,\nAre holy, righteous, fair.\nWe own our sins as crimson are,\nWe've no excuse to bear.\nWe've no argument, no plea;\nNo veil our sin can hide.\nBut, praise Thee, Lord, Thy precious blood\nIs to our sin applied!", "3 God has not overlooked our sin,\nBut judged it once for all;\nHis righteous fury, not on us,\nBut on His Lamb did fall.\nA new and living way is made-\nWe stand on legal ground;\nOur Surety and our Substitute\nHas pardon for us found.", "4 O Jesus Lord, we worship Thee,\nRedemption now enjoy;\nThy precious blood again we see,\nIts virtue now employ.\nDear Lord, Thy mercy is so vast,\nUnlimited and free.\nOh, Lamb of God, we'll sing Thy praise,\nThrough all eternity!"]
