["1 Jesus, our Lord, with what joy we adore Thee,\nChanting our praise to Thyself on the throne!\nBlest in Thy presence, we worship before Thee,\nOwn Thou art worthy, and worthy alone.", "chorus Lord, Thou art worthy: \"Lord, Thou art worthy;\nLord, Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!\nBlest in Thy presence, we worship before Thee,\nOwn Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!", "2 Verily God, yet become truly human,\nLower than angels to die in our stead;\nHow has that long promised \"Seed of the woman\nTrod on the serpent and bruised his head!", "3 How didst Thou humble Thyself to be taken.\nLed by Thy creatures and nailed to the cross.\nHated of men, and of God too forsaken,\nShunning not darkness, the curse, and the loss.", "4 How hast Thou triumphed, and triumphed with glory,\nBattled death's forces, rolled back every wave!\nCan we refrain then from telling the story?\nLord, Thou art Victor o'er death and the grave."]
