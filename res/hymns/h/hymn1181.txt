["1 Lord, to know Thee as our Person,\nEarnestly we seek and pray;\nTo experience Thy fulness\nIn a constant inner way.\nNever longer only outward\nOr with soulish thoughts obsessed,\nBut, O Lord, in realest contact\nWe by Thee would be possessed.", "chorus Lord, Thou art our Person,\nIn our inmost being,\nMay we constantly experience\nThis reality.", "2 All the world is under darkness,\nDriven by the fallen soul,\nAnd the enemy designing\nDoes the soulish life control.\nSuch we were till God, through mercy,\nCaused His Son to dwell in us;\nNow we fully come to know Him\nIn His church so glorious.", "3 Once we walked a soulish person,\nWandering in the wilderness,\nNever knowing that our spirit\nCraved God's fullness to express;\nAt the moment Jesus entered\nInstantly the whole was changed.\nNow we're people spirit-centered!\nHallelujah! Rearranged!", "4 Now our spirit is our person-\nWhat a glorious fact is this!\nChrist Himself in us expressing\nGod's intent and holiness.\nNot the soul-life's vain delusion,\nBut the spirit strengthened is;\nChrist Himself is now our Person-\nHe is ours and we are His."]
