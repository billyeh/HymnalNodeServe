["1 Our God and Father, we respond to Thee\nAs sons brought near,\nSuited, in love and holy liberty,\nTo this blest sphere.\nO wondrous thought, that many there should be\nLike Christ, for Thy delight eternally!", "2 He, Thy delight, in whom we have our part,\nThrough grace to share\nThy love for Him, the Object of Thy heart\nBeyond compare.\nHis glory in Thy presence now we see,\nAs with Him there in love's complacency.", "3 'Tis here He sings-what joy His heart doth find,\nThyself to praise,\nWhile many sons are stirred in heart and mind\nOne voice to raise\nIn worship, God and Father, unto Thee,\nSupreme, Thou Source in love's economy!"]
