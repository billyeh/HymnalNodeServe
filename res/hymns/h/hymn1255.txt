["1 We are for the Lord's recovery\nOf the local church;\nWe are for the Lord's recovery\nOf the city and the earth.\nStanding on the ground of oneness,\nOneness in the Lord,\nWe are building up the temple\nOf our glorious Lord.", "chorus We are for the Lord's,\nWe are for the Lord's,\nWe are for the Lord's recovery!\nWe are for the Lord's,\nWe are for the Lord's,\nWe are for the Lord's recovery!", "2 We are for the Lord's recovery,\nTo our hearts so dear;\nWhen we exercise our spirit,\nOur vision is so clear.\nBabylon the Great is fallen,\nSatan is cast down,\nAnd the local church is builded\nOn the local ground."]
