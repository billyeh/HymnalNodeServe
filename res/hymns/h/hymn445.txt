["1 Take my life, and let it be\nConsecrated, Lord, to Thee;\nTake my moments and my days,\nLet them flow in ceaseless praise,\nLet them flow in ceaseless praise.", "2 Take my hands, and let them move\nAt the impulse of Thy love;\nTake my feet and let them be\nSwift and beautiful for Thee,\nSwift and beautiful for Thee.", "3 Take my voice, and let me sing\nAlways, only, for my King;\nTake my lips, and let them be\nFilled with messages from Thee,\nFilled with messages from Thee.", "4 Take my silver and my gold;\nNot a mite would I withhold;\nTake my intellect, and use\nEvery power as Thou shalt choose,\nEvery power as Thou shalt choose.", "5 Take my will, and make it Thine;\nIt shall be no longer mine.\nTake my heart; it is Thine own;\nIt shall be Thy royal throne,\nIt shall be Thy royal throne.", "6 Take my love; my Lord, I pour\nAt Thy feet its treasure-store.\nTake myself, and I will be\nEver, only, all for Thee,\nEver, only, all for Thee."]
