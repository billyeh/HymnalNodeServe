["1 Safe in the arms of Jesus,\nSafe on His gentle breast,\nThere by His love o'ershaded,\nSweetly my soul doth rest.\nHark! 'tis a song of heaven\nBorne in the sweetest voice,\nEchoed by saints in spirit,\nMaking my heart rejoice.", "chorus Safe in the arms of Jesus,\nSafe on His gentle breast,\nThere by His love o'ershaded,\nSweetly my soul doth rest.", "2 Safe in the arms of Jesus,\nSafe from corroding care,\nSafe from the world's temptations,\nSin cannot harm me there.\nFree from the blight of sorrow,\nFree from my doubts and fears;\nOnly a few more trials,\nOnly a few more tears.", "3 Jesus, my heart's dear Refuge,\nJesus has died for me;\nFirm on the Rock of Ages\nEver my trust shall be.\nHere let me wait with patience,\nWait till the night is o'er,\nWait till I see the morning\nBreak on the golden shore."]
