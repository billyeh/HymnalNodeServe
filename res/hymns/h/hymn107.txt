["1 Not all the blood of beasts,\nOn Jewish altars slain,\nCould give the guilty conscience peace,\nOr wash away its stain.", "2 But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,\nTakes all our sins away;\nA sacrifice of nobler name,\nAnd richer blood than they.", "3 My faith would lay her hand\nOn that dear head of Thine,\nWhile like a penitent I stand,\nAnd there confess my sin.", "4 My soul looks back to see\nThe burdens Thou didst bear\nWhen hanging on the cursed tree,\nAnd knows her guilt was there.", "5 Believing, we rejoice\nTo see the curse remove;\nWe bless the Lamb with cheerful voice,\nAnd sing His bleeding love."]
