["1 Lamb of God so pure and spotless,\nLamb of God for sinners slain.\nThy shed blood has wrought redemption,\nCleansing us from every stain.\nLamb redeeming, Lamb redeeming,\nBearing all our sins away,\nBearing all our sins away!", "2 Brazen serpent, to Thee looking,\nSon of Man, uplifted high.\nThou didst bear the flesh of sin in\nLikeness on the cross to die.\nOld creation's termination;\nFinished, Satan and the world,\nFinished Satan and the world!", "3 Grain of wheat, so small and lowly,\nWithout death abides alone;\nLife divine enclosed within it,\nInto death it must be sown.\nLife releasing, Christ increasing,\nMany grains to birth to bring,\nMany grains to birth to bring!", "4 Lamb of God-our sin's redemption,\nBrazen serpent-Satan's end,\nGrain of wheat-life's reproduction,\nNow with many grains we blend.\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nWhat an all-inclusive death,\nWhat an all-inclusive death!"]
