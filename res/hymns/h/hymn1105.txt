["1 Lo, the table spread before us\nWith the bread and with the wine:\nLo, the Savior waiting for us,\nBidding us to come and dine.\n\"Come and dine,\" the Lord is calling,\n\"Sup with Me and I with thee\"\nHe's prepared for us this table-\nLet us feast abundantly.", "2 We are feasting with our Savior,\nHe with us and we with Him;\nHallelujah, hallelujah!\nFeast of feasts that ne'er will end!\nEating, drinking with Thyself, Lord,\nWe are wholly satisfied.\nTaste we of that glorious banquet\nThou wilt share with us, Thy Bride."]
