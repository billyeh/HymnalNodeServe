["1 I hear my risen Savior say:\n\"Follow me, follow me, follow me\";\nHis voice is calling all the day,\n\"Follow me, follow me, follow me;\nFor thee I trod the bitter way,\nFor thee I gave my life away,\nAnd drank the gall thy debt to pay,\nFollow me, follow me, follow me.\"", "2 \"I know thy life of guilt and pain;\nFollow me, follow me, follow me!\nI know each ache of heart and brain;\nFollow me, follow me, follow me!\nHow often I have called in vain,\nAnd offered pardon in my name,\nAnd now I plead yet once again!\nFollow me, follow me, follow me!\"", "3 \"Though thou hast sinned I'll pardon thee;\nFollow me, follow me, follow me!\nFrom every sin I'll set thee free;\nFollow me, follow me, follow me!\nIn all thy changing life I'll be\nThy God, thy guide on land and sea,\nThy bliss through all eternity,\nFollow me, follow me, follow me!\"", "4 \"Come, cast on Me thine every care;\nFollow me, follow me, follow me!\nThy heavy load I will upbear;\nFollow me, follow me, follow me!\nCome, look to Me-dismiss thy fears;\nAnd trust Me through eternal years;\nMy hand shall wipe away thy tears;\nFollow me, follow me, follow me!\"", "5 Dear Lord, I yield to Thee my will;\nI'll follow Thee, follow Thee, follow Thee!\nOh, bid my struggling soul be still;\nI'll follow Thee, follow Thee, follow Thee!\nLord, cleanse me, with Thy Spirit fill,\nAnd keep me safe from every ill;\nAnd all Thy Word in me fulfill;\nI'll follow Thee, follow Thee, follow Thee!"]
