["1 Thou hidden source of calm repose,\nThou all-sufficient love divine;\nMy help and refuge from my foes,\nSecure I am, if Thou art mine;\nFrom sin and grief, from guilt and shame,\nI hide me, Jesus, in Thy name.", "2 Jesus, my All in all Thou art,\nMy rest in toil, mine ease in pain;\nThe med'cine of my broken heart;\nIn war, my peace; in loss, my gain;\nMy smile beneath the tyrant's frown;\nIn shame, my glory and my crown.", "3 In want, my plentiful supply;\nIn weakness, mine almighty power;\nIn bonds, my perfect liberty;\nMy light in Satan's darkest hour;\nIn grief, my joy unspeakable;\nMy life in death; my Lord, my all."]
