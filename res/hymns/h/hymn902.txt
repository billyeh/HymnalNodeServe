["1 Shine Thou upon us, Lord,\nTrue Light of men, today,\nAnd through the written Word\nThy very self display;\nThat so from hearts which burn\nWith gazing on Thy face,\nThy little ones may learn\nThe wonders of Thy grace.", "2 Breathe Thou upon us, Lord,\nThy Spirit's living flame,\nThat so with one accord\nOur lips may tell Thy name;\nGive Thou the hearing ear,\nFix Thou the wandering thought,\nThat those we teach may hear\nThe great things Thou hast wrought.", "3 Speak Thou for us, O Lord,\nIn all we say of Thee;\nAccording to Thy Word\nLet all our teaching be;\nThat so Thy lambs may know\nTheir own true Shepherd's voice,\nWhere'er He leads them go,\nAnd in His love rejoice.", "4 Live Thou within us, Lord;\nThy mind and will be ours;\nBe Thou beloved, adored,\nAnd served with all our powers;\nThat so our lives may teach\nThy children what Thou art,\nAnd plead, by more than speech,\nFor Thee with every heart."]
