["1 O Jesus, I have promised\nTo serve Thee to the end;\nBe Thou forever near me,\nMy Master and my Friend;\nI shall not fear the battle\nIf Thou art by my side,\nNor wander from the pathway\nIf Thou wilt be my Guide.", "2 Oh, let me feel Thee near me;\nThe world is ever near;\nI see the sights that dazzle,\nThe tempting sounds I hear;\nMy foes are ever near me,\nAround me and within;\nBut, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,\nAnd shield my soul from sin.", "3 Oh, let me hear Thee speaking,\nIn accents clear and still,\nAbove the storms of passion,\nThe murmurs of self-will;\nOh, speak to reassure me,\nTo hasten, or control;\nOh, speak, and make me listen,\nThou Guardian of my soul.", "4 O Jesus, Thou hast promised\nTo all who follow Thee\nThat where Thou art in glory\nThere shall Thy servant be;\nAnd Jesus, I have promised\nTo serve Thee to the end;\nOh, give me grace to follow,\nMy Master and my Friend.", "5 Oh, let me see Thy footmarks,\nAnd in them plant mine own;\nMy hope to follow duly\nIs in Thy strength alone.\nOh, guide me, call me, draw me,\nUphold me to the end;\nAnd then to rest receive me,\nMy Savior and my Friend."]
