["1 Grant us the vision clear to see\nWe need a new humanity;\nFrom all our nature, we must be free;\nEating of Jesus is the key!\nBreathing this man within the Word,\nCalling with them who call \"O Lord\";\nEating this man in one accord-\nBreathe, call and eat!", "2 Our flesh for building is no good;\nGod's house must have acacia wood!\nChrist's human life is balanced and fine,\nAnd it's adorned with gold divine.\nWe want to stand as boards so strong,\nHeld by the bars where we belong;\nTo be the church for which You long-\nOne full-grown man!", "3 Satan's one aim: \"to ruin man,\nMan, who's the center of God's plan!\nBut man will rule the earth utterly,\nConquering every enemy.\nEach time we turn and eat this man\nWe put an end to Satan's plan.\nJesus through His humanity\nHas conquered all!"]
