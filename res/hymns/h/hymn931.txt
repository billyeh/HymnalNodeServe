["1 Out in the darkness,\nShadowed by sin,\nSouls are in bondage,\nSouls we would win.\nHow can we win them?\nHow show the way?\n\"Love never faileth,\"\nLove is the way.", "2 Think how the Savior\nCame from above\nSuffered on Calvary,\nBreathing out love;\nThink how He loves us,\nE'en when we stray:\nWe must love others,\nLove is His way.", "3 See, they are waiting,\nLooking at you,\nSilently watching\nAll that you do;\nSeeming so careless,\nHardened and lost:\n\"Love never faileth,\"\nCount not the cost.", "4 \"Love never faileth,\"\nLove is pure gold:\nLove is what Jesus\nCame to unfold;\nLove these souls thru us,\nSavior, we pray;\nThy love ne'er faileth,\nLove is Thy way."]
