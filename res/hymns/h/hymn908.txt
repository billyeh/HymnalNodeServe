["1 Not of letters, but of spirit\nThe New Testamental way;\nFor 'tis life the spirit giveth\nBut the letters always slay.\nOutward work God never reckons\nBut what's from the inmost part;\nIt is not to serve in letter\nBut life's newness to impart.", "2 Not just by the outward teachings\nBut by His anointing moved;\nNot just by the outward pattern\nBut by inward vision proved.\nNot by human rules or rituals\nBut by heaven's rule within;\nNot by human-made decisions\nBut by guidance giv'n of Him.", "3 Not a dead religion serving\nBut in Christ as life to live;\nNot theology dispensing\nBut a living Christ to give.\nNot the knowledge of mere doctrine\nBut the message Christ should be;\nNot the gifts, the forms, the teachings\nBut God's Christ-reality.", "4 Not objectively to worship\nBut to serve Him inwardly;\nNot to preach a Christ objective\nBut Himself subjectively.\nNot just by the Scripture serving\nBut in spirit and in life;\nNot by flesh, but by the Spirit,\nFilling, freeing from all strife."]
