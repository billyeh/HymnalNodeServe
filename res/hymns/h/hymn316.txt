["1 Some day the silver cord will break,\nAnd I no more as now shall sing;\nBut, O the joy when I shall wake\nWithin the presence of the King!", "chorus And I shall see Him face to face,\nAnd tell the story, saved by grace:\nAnd I shall see Him face to face,\nAnd tell the story, saved by grace.", "2 Some day my earthly house will fall,\nI cannot tell how soon 'twill be,\nBut this I know-my All in all\nHas now a place with Him for me.", "3 Or some day when my Lord will come,\nAnd called to meet Him I'll be blest,\nHe then will say to me, \"Well done,\"\nAnd I shall enter into rest.", "4 Some day, till then I'll watch and wait,\nMy lamp all trimmed and burning bright,\nThat when my Savior I will greet,\nMy faith will then be changed to sight."]
