["1 All thy griefs by Him are ordered,\nNeedful is each one for thee;\nAll thy tears by Him are counted,\nOne too much there cannot be;\nAnd if while they fall so quickly\nThou canst own His way is right,\nThen each bitter tear of anguish\nPrecious is in Jesus' sight.", "2 Far too well thy Savior loves thee\nTo allow thy life to be\nOne long, calm, unbroken summer-\nOne unruffled, stormless sea;\nHe would have thee fondly nestling\nCloser to His loving breast,\nHe would have that day seem brighter\nWhen alone is perfect rest."]
