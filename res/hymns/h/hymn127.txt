["1 Hark! ten thousand voices crying,\n\"Lamb of God!\" with one accord;\nThousand thousand saints replying,\nWake at once the echo'ng chord.", "2 \"Praise the Lamb!\" the chorus waking,\nAll in heav'n together throng;\nLoud and far each tongue partaking\nRolls around the endless song.", "3 Grateful incense this, ascending\nEver to the Father's throne;\nEvery knee to Jesus bending,\nAll the mind in heav'n is one.", "4 All the Father's counsels claiming\nEqual honors to the Son,\nAll the Son's effulgence beaming,\nMakes the Father's glory known.", "5 By the Spirit all pervading,\nHosts unnumbered round the Lamb,\nCrowned with light and joy unfading,\nHail Him as the great \"I AM.\"", "6 Joyful now the new creation\nRests in undisturbed repose,\nBlest in Jesus' full salvation,\nSorrow now nor thraldom knows.", "7 Hark! the heavenly notes again!\nLoudly swells the song of praise;\nThrough creation's vault, Amen!\nAmen! responsive joy doth raise."]
