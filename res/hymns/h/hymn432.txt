["1 O Love, that wilt not let me go,\nI rest my weary soul in Thee;\nI give Thee back the life I owe,\nThat in Thine ocean depths its flow\nMay richer, fuller be.", "2 O Light, that followest all my way,\nI yield my flickering torch to Thee;\nMy heart restores its borrowed ray,\nThat in Thy sunshine's blaze its day\nMay brighter, fairer be.", "3 O Joy, that seekest me through pain,\nI cannot close my heart to Thee;\nI trace the rainbow through the rain,\nAnd feel the promise is not vain\nThat morn shall tearless be.", "4 O Cross, that liftest up my head,\nI dare not ask to fly from Thee;\nI lay in dust life's glory dead,\nAnd from the ground there blossoms red\nLife that shall endless be."]
