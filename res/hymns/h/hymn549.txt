["1 Enter the veil and go without the camp\nTaste heaven's sweetness, thus the earth forsake;\nIf by the Holiest I am satisfied\nHow can I of earth's vanities partake?", "2 Enter the veil and go without the camp\nBy heaven's presence will the earth depart;\nIf heaven's glory doth my spirit charm\nHow can earth's happiness possess my heart?", "3 Enter the veil, behold the glorious Christ\nGo out the camp to Jesus, let Him lead;\nIf throne and crown my spirit here enthrall\nManger and cross cannot my steps impede.", "4 Enter the veil for resurrection pow'r\nGo out the camp to bear the cross and woe\nIf I His radiant face in heaven see\nHis footsteps I will follow here below.", "5 Enter the veil, on heaven's fatness feast\nWithout the camp, in hardship persevere;\nThough earthly trials sorely pain my heart\nHeaven's communion doth my spirit cheer.", "6 Enter the veil, Christ's riches there enjoy\nWithout the camp, the needs of men supply;\nThe life of heaven living out thru me,\nThe souls of earth will bless and satisfy.", "7 Enter the veil till it exists no more\nGo out the camp till all the camps are gone;\nUntil the heavens and the earth unite\nTill God and man together dwell in one."]
