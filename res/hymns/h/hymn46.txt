["1 O gracious God, Thy pleasure\nIs in Thy Christ made known,\nAnd tells the boundless measure\nOf blessing for Thine own.\nHe has Thy presence entered,\nAs Man in heav'n is known;\nIn Him Thy glory's centered,\nIn Him Thy purpose shown.", "2 And O what love is beaming\nRefulgent in that face!\nWhat blessed light is streaming\nFrom that most glorious place!\nBoth love and light proclaiming\nWhat Thou, the Father, art,\nAnd wondrous grace revealing,\nWith Thine own Son, our part.", "3 Thou source of every blessing!\nThou spring of all delight!\nThy Name with joy confessing\nLet all the saints unite!\nEach heart its praise outpouring\nTo Thee all praise above,\nEach voice in strains adoring\nRe-echoes-\"God is love.\""]
