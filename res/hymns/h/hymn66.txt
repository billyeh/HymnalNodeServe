["1 How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds\nIn a believer's ear!\nIt soothes his sorrow, heals his wounds,\nAnd drives away his fear.", "2 It makes the wounded spirit whole,\nAnd calms the troubled breast;\n'Tis manna to the hungry soul,\nAnd to the weary rest.", "3 Dear Name! the Rock on which we build;\nOur shield and hiding-place;\nOur never-failing treasury, filled\nWith boundless stores of grace.", "4 Jesus, our Savior, Shepherd, Friend,\nOur Prophet, Priest, and King;\nOur Lord, our Life, our Way, our End,\nAccept the praise we bring.", "5 Weak is the effort of our heart,\nAnd cold our warmest thought;\nBut when we see Thee as Thou art,\nWe'll praise Thee as we ought.", "6 Till then we would Thy love proclaim\nWith every fleeting breath;\nAnd triumph in that blessed Name\nWhich quells the pow'r of death.\nnote: \"(Repeat the last two lines of each stanza)"]
