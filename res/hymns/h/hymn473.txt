["1 No mortal tongue can e'er describe\nThe freedom of the soul,\nWhen passed beyond all earthly bribe\nTo God's complete control.\nAll things are his, yes, life, and death,\nThings present or to come;\nIn Christ he draws in peace each breath,\nIn Christ he finds his home.", "2 When such as we the King can choose,\nTo share with Him His throne,\n'Tis passing strange that we refuse\nTo be our Lord's alone.\nO never speak of sacrifice!\nA privilege untold\nIs to be His at any price,\nIn Calv'ry's hosts enrolled.", "3 Arise! the holy bargain strike-\nThe fragment for the whole-\nAll men and all events alike\nMust serve the ransomed soul.\nAll things are yours when you are His,\nAnd He and you are one;\nA boundless life in Him there is,\nWhence doubt and fear are gone."]
