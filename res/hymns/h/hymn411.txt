["1 Bless'd are the pure in heart,\nFor they shall see our God;\nThe secret of the Lord is theirs,\nTheir heart is Christ's abode.", "2 The Lord, who left the heavens,\nOur life and peace to bring,\nTo dwell in lowliness with men,\nTheir pattern and their King.", "3 He to the lowly soul\nDoth still Himself impart,\nAnd for His dwelling and His throne\nChooseth the pure in heart.", "4 Lord, we Thy presence seek;\nMay ours this blessing be;\nGive us a pure and lowly heart,\nA temple meet for Thee."]
