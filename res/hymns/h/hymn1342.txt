["1 Therefore, they shall come and sing in the height of Zion,\nAnd shall flow together to the goodness of the Lord,\nFor wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young,\nfor the young of the flock and of the herd:\nAnd their soul shall be as a watered garden;\nAnd they shall not sorrow any more at all."]
