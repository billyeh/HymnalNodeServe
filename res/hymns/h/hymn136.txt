["1 Gazing on the Lord in glory,\nWhile our hearts in worship bow,\nThere we read the wondrous story\nOf the cross-its shame and woe.", "2 Every mark of dark dishonor\nHeaped upon the thorn-crowned brow\nAll the depths of Thy heart's sorrow\nTold in answ'ring glory now.", "3 On that cross, alone, forsaken,\nWhere no pity'ng eye was found;\nNow, to God's right hand exalted,\nWith Thy praise the heavens resound.", "4 Did Thy God e'en then forsake Thee,\nHide His face from Thy deep need?\nIn Thy face once marred and smitten,\nAll His glory now we read.", "5 Gazing on it we adore Thee,\nBlessed, precious, holy Lord;\nThou the Lamb, alone art worthy-\nThis be earth's and heaven's accord.", "6 Rise our hearts, and bless the Father,\nCeaseless song e'en here begun,\nEndless praise and adoration\nTo the Father and the Son."]
