["1 When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed,\nWhen you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,\nCount your many blessings name them one by one,\nAnd it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.", "chorus Count your blessings, name them one by one;\nCount your blessings, see what God hath done;\nCount your blessings, name them one by one,\nAnd it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.", "2 Are you ever burdened with a load of care?\nDoes the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?\nCount your many blessings, every doubt will fly,\nAnd you will be singing as the days go by.", "3 When you look at others with their lands and gold,\nThink that Christ has promised you His wealth untold.\nCount your many blessings, money cannot buy\nYour reward in heaven, nor your Lord on high.", "4 So amid the conflict, whether great or small,\nDo not be discouraged, God is over all;\nCount your many blessings, angels will attend,\nHelp and comfort give you to your journey's end."]
