["1 Jesus, my life, Thyself apply;\nThy Holy Spirit breathe;\nMy vile affections crucify;\nConform me to Thy death.", "2 Conqu'ror of hell and earth and sin,\nStill with the rebel strive;\nEnter my soul and work within,\nAnd kill and make alive.", "3 More of Thy life, and more I have,\nAs the old Adam dies;\nBury me, Savior, in Thy grave,\nThat I with Thee may rise.", "4 Reign in me, Lord; Thy foes control,\nWho would not own Thy sway;\nDiffuse Thine image through my soul;\nShine to the perfect day.", "5 Scatter the last remains of sin,\nAnd seal me Thine abode;\nO make me glorious all within,\nA temple built by God!"]
