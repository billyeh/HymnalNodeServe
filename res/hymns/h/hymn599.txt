["1 Lord, I was blind; I could not see\nIn Thy marred visage any grace,\nBut now the beauty of Thy face\nIn radiant vision dawns on me.", "2 Lord, I was deaf; I could not hear\nThe thrilling music of Thy voice;\nBut now I hear Thee and rejoice,\nAnd all Thine uttered words are dear!", "3 Lord, I was dumb; I could not speak\nThe grace and glory of Thy name;\nBut now, as touched with living flame,\nMy lips Thine eager praises wake.", "4 Lord, I was dead; I could not stir\nMy lifeless soul to come to Thee;\nBut now, since Thou hast quickened me,\nI rise from sin's dark sepulcher.", "5 For Thou hast made the blind to see,\nThe deaf to hear, the dumb to speak,\nThe dead to live; and, lo, I break\nThe chains of my captivity."]
