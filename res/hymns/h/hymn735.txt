["1 The law of letters God defines\nIt is His testimony true;\nIt shows how loving, holy, just\nIs God, with whom we have to do.", "2 According to His nature shown,\nGod's law requires that we must live\nThat He our souls may justify,\nAnd unto us His blessing give.", "3 The law can never give us life\nNor any strength to us supply\nBut doth its full demands exact,\nAnd all our weakness show thereby.", "4 It was not for God's final plan\nBut for man's sin was introduced\nThat man by breaking it might know,\nHimself, his sin to him adduced.", "5 'Tis by the law all mouths are stopped,\nAnd all are shut up under sin;\nIt brings us to the Christ of God,\nThat God may bless us all in Him.", "6 The law is but a type of Christ\nWho God's full testimony is\nWho fully has expressed His love\nHis holiness and righteousness.", "7 'Tis Christ, God's testimony real\nWho doth with life divine supply\nThat with the law's demands we may,\nBe more than able to comply.", "8 God's living testimony, He;\nBy whom God's potent life we share;\nThru Him we're dead unto the law\nAnd in His Spirit fruit we bear."]
