["1 In the Name of Jesus\nEvery knee shall bow,\nEvery tongue confess Him\nKing of glory now;\n'Tis the Father's pleasure\nWe should call Him Lord,\nWho from the beginning\nWas the Mighty Word.", "2 At His voice creation\nSprang at once to sight:\nAll the angel faces,\nAll the hosts of light,\nThrones and dominations,\nStars upon their way,\nAll the heav'nly orders,\nIn their great array.", "3 Humbled for a season,\nTo receive a Name\nFrom the lips of sinners\nUnto whom He came,\nFaithfully He bore it\nSpotless to the last,\nBrought it back victorious,\nWhen from death He passed;", "4 Bore it up triumphant,\nWith its human light,\nThrough all ranks of creatures,\nTo the central height;\nTo the throne of Godhead,\nTo the Father's breast,\nFilled it with the glory\nOf that perfect rest.", "5 Name Him, brothers, name Him,\nWith love strong as death,\nBut with awe and wonder,\nAnd with bated breath;\nHe is God the Savior,\nHe is Christ the Lord,\nEver to be worshiped,\nTrusted, and adored.", "6 In your hearts enthrone Him;\nThere let Him subdue\nAll that is not holy,\nAll that is not true;\nCrown Him as your Captain\nIn temptation's hour;\nLet His will enfold you\nIn its light and power.", "7 Brothers, this Lord Jesus\nShall return again,\nWith His Father's glory,\nWith His angel train;\nFor all wreaths of empire\nMeet upon His brow,\nAnd our hearts confess Him\nKing of glory now."]
