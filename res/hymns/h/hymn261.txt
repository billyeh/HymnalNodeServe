["1 Praise waiteth Thee in mercy's court,\nWhere Thy beloved dwell;\nRansomed, released from Satan's thrall,\nTheir Hallelujahs swell.\nCome, as the Spirit, Lord, today,\nOur songs of praise inspire;\nPurge the iniquity, and touch\nOur lips with living fire.", "2 Praise for what Thou our God hast wrought;\nFor promised blessings ours;\nThe cloud on faith's horizon seen,\nThe pentecostal showers.\nPraise for Thine own right way, dear Lord,\nWe did not understand,\nBut as Thy plans unfolded lie,\nWe see Thy guiding hand.", "3 Enlarge our soul's capacity,\nCut deeper channels, Lord;\nRoom for the floods of blessing now,\nAccording to Thy Word.\nE'en while we praise, the heavens rend,\nIn power come from on high;\nMake this another Pentecost,\nAnswer our spirit's cry."]
