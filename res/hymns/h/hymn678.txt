["1 I will not be afraid;\nI will not be afraid;\nI will look upward,\nAnd travel onward,\nAnd not be afraid.", "2 He says He will be with me;\nHe says He will be with me;\nHe goes before me,\nAnd is beside me,\nSo I'm not afraid.", "3 His arms are underneath me;\nHis arms are underneath me;\nHis hand upholds me,\nHis love enfolds me,\nSo I'm not afraid.", "4 His Word will stand for ever;\nHis Word will stand for ever;\nHis truth it shall be\nMy shield and buckler,\nSo I'm not afraid.", "5 He will give grace and glory;\nHe will give grace and glory;\nHis cross before me,\nHis banner o'er me,\nSo I'm not afraid.", "6 So we go singing onward;\nSo we go singing onward;\nWe're pressing forward,\nWe're marching upward,\nTo Him unafraid."]
