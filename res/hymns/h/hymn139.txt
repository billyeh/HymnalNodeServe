["1 All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name!\nLet angels prostrate fall,\nLet angels prostrate fall;\nBring forth the royal diadem,", "chorus And crown Him, crown Him,\",\ncrown Him, crown Him;\nAnd crown Him Lord of all!", "2 Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,\nYe ransomed from the fall,\nYe ransomed from the fall,\nHail Him who saves you by His grace,", "3 Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget\nThe wormwood and the gall,\nThe wormwood and the gall,\nGo, spread your trophies at His feet,", "4 Let every kindred, every tribe,\nOn this terrestrial ball,\nOn this terrestrial ball,\nTo Him all majesty ascribe,", "5 O that with yonder sacred throng\nWe at His feet may fall,\nWe at His feet may fall!\nWe'll join the everlasting song,"]
