["1 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,\nNor creed, nor form, nor word,\nNor holy Church, nor human love,\nCompare with Thee, my Lord!", "2 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,\nThy love has conquered me;\nBeneath Thy Cross I die to self,\nAnd live alone to Thee.", "3 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,\nMy inmost being fill;\nSo shall I think as Thou dost think,\nAnd will as Thou dost will.", "4 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,\nThy life transfigure mine;\nAnd through this veil of mortal flesh,\nLord, let Thy splendor shine.", "5 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,\nMy soul exults in Thee;\nTo be Thy slave, to do Thy will,\nIs my felicity."]
