["1 Divine anointing in me dwelleth\nAnd it teaches me all things;\nIt ever leads me in the Lord to live,\nAnd to me His presence brings.", "chorus In my spirit the anointing dwells\nO the anointing dwells and,\nteaches everything;\nIn my spirit the anointing dwells,\nAnd ever teaches everything.", "2 It is the moving of the Spirit,\nGracious as the ointment pure;\n'Tis based upon the sprinkling of the blood\nAnd it ever shall endure.", "3 With God's own essence it anoints me\nGod to know subjectively\nThat I may have His very element,\nFully saturating me.", "4 'Tis by this inner life-anointing,\nI in fellowship may move;\nIn God, the light of truth, I'm walking\nAnd the love of grace I prove."]
