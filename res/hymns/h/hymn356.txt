["1 Thou Magnet of my soul!\nLet me come nearer, till\nThe life of self pulsates no more,\nBut is forever still.", "2 Thou Sunshine of my heart!\nFill Thou each crevice there,\nAnd let Thy garden yield to Thee\nA fragrance sweet and rare.", "3 Thou Ransomer from death!\nPossess Thy ransomed one:\nAppropriate to Thine Own use\nThe spoil that Thou hast won.", "4 Thou Lord of Life and Light!\nI bow beneath Thy sway,\nAnd count it holy privilege\nThy precepts to obey.", "5 Thou Gift unspeakable!\nStraight from God's heart of love;\nI break my heart to give Thee room\nAnd thus Thy sweetness prove."]
