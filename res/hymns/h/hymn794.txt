["1 Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, I care not how,\nBut stir my heart in passion for the world,\nStir me to give, to go, but most to pray;\nStir till the blood-red banner be unfurled\nO'er lands that still in heathen darkness lie,\nO'er deserts where no cross is lifted high.", "2 Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, till all my heart\nIs filled with strong compassion for these-souls;\nTill Thy compelling word drives me to pray;\nTill Thy constraining love reach to the poles\nFar north and south, in burning deep desire,\nTill east and west are caught in love's great fire.", "3 Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, till prayer is pain,\nTill prayer is joy, till prayer turns into praise;\nStir me, till heart and will and mind, yea, all\nIs wholly Thine to use through all the days.\nStir, till I learn to pray exceedingly;\nStir, till I learn to wait expectantly.", "4 Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, Thy heart was stirred\nBy love's intensest fire, till Thou didst give\nThine only Son, Thy best beloved One,\nE'en to the dreadful cross, that I might live.\nStir me to give myself so back to Thee,\nThat Thou canst give Thyself again through me.", "5 Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, for I can see\nThy glorious triumph-day begin to break;\nThe dawn already gilds the eastern sky;\nOh, Church of Christ, arise, awake, awake.\nOh! stir us, Lord, as heralds of that day.\nFor night is past, our King is on His way."]
