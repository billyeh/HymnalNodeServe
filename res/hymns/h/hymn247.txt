["1 Our blest Redeemer ere He breathed\nHis tender last farewell,\nA guide, a comforter, bequeathed\nWith us to dwell.", "2 He came sweet influence to impart,\nA gracious, willing guest,\nWhile He can find one humble heart\nWherein to rest.", "3 And His that gentle voice we hear,\nSoft as the breath of even,\nThat checks each fault, that calms each fear\nWith peace of heav'n.", "4 And every virtue we possess,\nAnd every victory won,\nAnd every thought of holiness,\nAre His alone.", "5 Lord, in Thy purity and grace,\nOur weakness pitying see;\nOh, make our heart Thy dwelling place,\nAnd worthier Thee."]
