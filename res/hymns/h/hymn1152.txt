["1 To Jesus every day we find our hearts are closer drawn;\nHe's fairer than the sons of men and fresher than the morn;\nHe's all that we can say of Him in fairest words and more,\nAnd every day He's dearer than He was the day before.", "chorus The half cannot be fancied of such a treasure-store,\nAnd every day He's dearer than He ever was before!", "2 His glory broke upon us when we saw Him in the church,\nFor here are all His riches, here we've given up our search;\n'Tis here He satisfies our longing spirits o'er and o'er,\nAnd every day He's dearer than He was the day before.", "3 Now He's the living Spirit who within our spirit dwells,\nAnd by His sweet anointing, how His life within us swells!\nAs with the saints we're meeting, full released our spirits soar,\nFor now our Lord is dearer than He ever was before.", "4 The Lord has made us one with Him for His recovery:\nThe riches of this Christ, the church His fullness, men must see.\nYes, all we have and all we are, we every day outpour\nFor His tremendous purpose, ever dearer than before."]
