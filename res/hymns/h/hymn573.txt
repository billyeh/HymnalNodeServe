["1 Once I thought I walked with Jesus,\nYet such changeful feelings had;\nSometimes trusting, sometimes doubting,\nSometimes joyful, sometimes sad.", "chorus Oh, the peace the Savior gives!\nPeace I never knew before;\nAnd my way has brighter grown\nSince I've learned to trust Him more.", "2 But He call'd me closer to Him,\nBade my doubting, fearing, cease;\nAnd when I had fully yielded,\nFilled my soul with perfect peace.", "3 Now I'm trusting every moment,\nNothing less can be enough;\nAnd the Savior bears me gently\nO'er those places once so rough.", "4 Day by day my soul He's keeping\nBy His wondrous power within;\nAnd my heart is full of singing\nTo my Savior from all sin."]
