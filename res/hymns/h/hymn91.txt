["1 It was alone the Savior prayed\nIn dark Gethsemane;\nAlone He drained the bitter cup\nAnd suffered there for me.", "chorus Alone, alone,\nHe bore it all alone;\nHe gave Himself to save His own,\nHe suffered, bled and died alone, alone.", "2 It was alone the Savior stood\nIn Pilate's judgment hall;\nAlone the crown of thorns He wore,\nForsaken thus by all.", "3 Alone upon the cross He hung\nThat others He might save;\nForsaken then by God and man.\nAlone, His life He gave.", "4 Can you reject such matchless love?\nCan you His claim disown?\nCome, give your all in gratitude,\nNor leave Him thus alone."]
