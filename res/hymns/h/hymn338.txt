["1 Wounded for me, wounded for me,\nThere on the cross He was wounded for me;\nGone my transgressions, and now I am free,\nAll because Jesus was wounded for me.", "2 Dying for me, dying for me,\nThere on the cross He was dying for me;\nNow in His death my redemption I see,\nAll because Jesus was dying for me.", "3 Risen for me, risen for me,\nUp from the grave He has risen for me;\nNow evermore from death's sting I am free,\nAll because Jesus has risen for me.", "4 Living for me, living for me,\nUp in the skies He is living for me;\nDaily He's pleading and praying for me,\nAll because Jesus is living for me.", "5 Coming for me, coming for me,\nSoon in the air He is coming for me;\nThen with what joy His dear face I shall see,\nOh, how I praise Him! He's coming for me."]
