["1 Lord, to know Thee as the Body,\nIs my desperate need today,\nOh, to see Thee in Thy members,\n'Tis for this I long and pray.\nNo more just to know Thy headship\nIn an individual way,\nBut to see Thee incarnated,\nAs the Body-Christ, I pray.", "2 Through the years, Thy saints have sought Thee,\nLonging for reality;\nGazing upward, searching inward,\nThirsting for the sight of Thee.\nNow reveal that Christ in heaven,\nIs the Body manifest;\nAnd the Christ who dwells within us\nAs the Body is expressed.", "3 Prone to be misled, I know it,\nBy my lofty thoughts of Thee,\nEasy 'tis for self to seek Thee,\nYet not touch reality,\nOh, how much I need to find Thee,\nIn Thy members here below.\nGod eternal dwells among us,\nManifest in flesh to know.", "4 Limit, Lord, my independence,\nLet me to Thy Body turn;\nNot just seeking light from heaven,\nBut the church's sense to learn.\nMay we be the stones for building\nNot the formless, useless clay,\nGain in us Thy heart's desire\nCorporately Thyself display."]
