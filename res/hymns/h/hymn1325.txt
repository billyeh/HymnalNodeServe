["1 God eternal has a purpose,\nFormed in His eternal past,\nSpreading to eternal future;\n'Twixt these ends all time is cast.\nFor with time there is the process,\nTime for His accomplishment;\nAnd in time we're merely travelers-\nFor eternity we're meant.", "2 God would have a group of people\nBuilt together in His plan,\nBlended, knit, coordinated\nAs His vessel-one new man.\nGod would come into this vessel\nWith His nature, life and ways,\nMingling Spirit with our spirits\nFor His joy and to His praise.", "3 God has worked in three directions\nFor His plan so marvelous:\nAs the Father, Son, and Spirit\nTo dispense Himself to us!\nAll creation gives the setting-\nHeav'n and earth are for this plan;\n'Tis for this God made a body,\nSoul and spirit-three-part man.", "4 As the center, as the kernel,\nOf God's plan our spirit is;\nCalling on the name of Jesus\nMakes our spirit one with His.\nFrom the center to circumference\nGod would saturate each part;\nFeeling, mind, and will renewing,\nMaking home in all our heart.", "5 Thus in life we're built together,\nThen in love we're knit as one;\nGod is now His plan fulfilling,\nFinishing what He's begun.\nLord, increase Thyself within us\nThat we might be built by Thee\nInto that great corporate vessel\nFilled with God exclusively.", "6 As the product, the fulfillment,\nWill the church in glory stand,\nConsummation of the purpose\nIn eternal ages planned.\nGod will have His corporate vessel,\nAll His glory to contain;\nLord, we're wholly for Thy purpose\nAll Thy goal in us attain."]
