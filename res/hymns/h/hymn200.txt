["1 Thou art the Sun of righteousness,\nWith healing in Thy wings;\nThe shining of Thy glorious face,\nTo us Thy riches brings.", "2 The tender mercy of our God,\nCaused Thee on us to dawn\nTo those in darkness giving light,\nThat shades of death be gone.", "3 Thou art the Morning without clouds\nAnd as the Morning Light;\nWe are the tender grass on earth\nWho in Thy rays delight.", "4 Thy shining light with pleasant rays,\nIncreases all the way;\nIt shines within us more and more,\nUntil the perfect day.", "5 It shines thru woe with clearest beams\nAs shining after rain;\nAnd in Thy mercy with Thy love,\nThy shining e'er remains.", "6 Thou also art the Morning Star,\nTo us as a reward;\nWhile still 'tis dark it shines with light,\nTo those who love the Lord.", "7 Lord, help us e'er to love Thy light,\nAnd see things from afar;\nAnd look for Thee in watch and prayer,\nAs for the Morning Star."]
