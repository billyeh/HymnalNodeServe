["1 In Eden's garden fair we see,\nThat God before two trees placed man\nThe trees of life, and knowledge too\nWhich for the Lord and Satan stand.", "2 The tree of life the center is,\nOf God's eternal, perfect plan\nDenoting God in Christ as life,\nTo be received as all by man.", "3 The tree of knowledge standing there\nBespeaks a sure and warning voice:\nOutside of God there is a source,\nOf death to all who make this choice.", "4 If man would eat the tree of life\nThen God as life he will receive\nAnd be transformed to precious stones\nGod's will and Purpose to achieve.", "5 If man the tree of knowledge takes\nThen Satan enters into man,\nAs sin, which brings him into death\nThat he may not fulfill God's plan.", "6 This signifies that only God,\nIs our full source of life and breath;\nTo touch ought else is but to touch,\nThe source of knowledge and of death.", "7 For knowledge only bringeth death\nThough evil or though good it seem;\nFor any thing apart from God\nIs but the fruit of Satan's scheme.", "8 Not only evil, but the good,\nIs contradictory to Christ;\nNot only knowledge of the bad\nBut even good is versus Christ.", "9 Lord, teach us only Thee to touch\nThat with Thy life we filled may be\nAnd not to touch the good or bad\nOr anything apart from Thee."]
