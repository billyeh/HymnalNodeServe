["1 Praise the Savior, ye who know Him!\nWho can tell how much we owe Him?\nGladly let us render to Him\nAll we are and have.", "2 Jesus is the name that charms us;\nHe for conflicts fits and arms us;\nNothing moves and nothing harms us\nWhen we trust in Him.", "3 Trust in Him, ye saints, forever;\nHe is faithful, changing never;\nNeither force nor guile can sever\nThose He loves from Him.", "4 Keep us, Lord, oh, keep us cleaving\nTo Thyself and still believing,\nTill the hour of Thy receiving\nThe victorious Bride.", "5 Then we shall be where we would be;\nThen we shall be what we should be;\nThings which are not now, nor could be,\nThen shall be our own."]
