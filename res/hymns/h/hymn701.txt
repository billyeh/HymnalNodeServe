["1 All the way my Savior leads me;\nWhat have I to ask beside?\nCan I doubt His tender mercy,\nWho through life has been my Guide?\nHeav'nly peace, divinest comfort,\nHere by faith in Him to dwell!\nFor I know, whate'er befall me,\nJesus doeth all things well,\nFor I know, whate'er befall me,\nJesus doeth all things well.", "2 All the way my Savior leads me,\nCheers each winding path I tread,\nGives me grace for every trial,\nFeeds me with the living bread.\nThough my weary steps may falter,\nAnd my soul athirst may be,\nGushing from the Rock before me,\nLo! a spring of joy I see,\nGushing from the Rock before me,\nLo! a spring of joy I see.", "3 All the way my Savior leads me;\nOh, the fullness of His grace!\nPerfect rest to me is promised\nIn my Father's blest embrace.\nWhen my spirit, clothed immortal,\nWings its flight to realms of day,\nThis my song through endless ages:\nJesus led me all the way,\nThis my song through endless ages:\nJesus led me all the way."]
