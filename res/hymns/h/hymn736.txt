["1 In ancient times the law of God,\nIn letter was engraved on stone;\nBut now it is a law of life\nWhich in our heart is written down.", "2 The law in letters good demands,\nAnd thus our utter weakness shows;\nBut now the law of life sustains\nAnd strength for God to please bestows.", "3 The law in letters brings to us,\nGod's knowledge only outwardly;\nBut now the law of life supplies,\nA deeper knowledge inwardly.", "4 The law in letters can but rule,\nBy dead commandments outwardly;\nBut now the law of life controls,\nBy living knowledge inwardly.", "5 This living law is moving now,\nIn all of our experience\nTo regulate us from within,\nAnd check us by our inner sense.", "6 How deep its regulation is,\nWithin the inmost part of us\nA living consciousness to give\nAnd God Himself impart to us.", "7 'Tis by this living law of life,\nWe need no teaching outwardly\nFor all God's living knowledge now,\nThis law will teach us inwardly.", "8 Lord, teach us by this law to walk\nIts inner ruling to obey\nThat we may of Thyself partake,\nAnd know Thee in a living way."]
