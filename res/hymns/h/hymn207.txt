["1 Lord Jesus! when we think of Thee,\nOf all Thy love and grace,\nOur spirits long and fain would see\nThy beauty face to face.", "2 And though the wilderness we tread,\nA barren, thirsty ground,\nWith thorns and briars overspread,\nWhere foes and snares abound;", "3 Yet in Thy love such depths we see,\nOur hearts o'erflow with praise-\nContent ourselves, while, Lord to Thee\nA joyful song we raise.", "4 Our Lord, our Life, our Rest, our Shield,\nOur Rock, our Food, our Light;\nEach thought of Thee doth constant yield\nUnchanging, fresh delight.", "5 Blest Savior, keep our spirit stayed,\nHard following after Thee,\nTill we, in victory displayed,\nThy face in glory see."]
