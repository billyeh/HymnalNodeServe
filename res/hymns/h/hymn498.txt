["1 This is my wonderful story,\nChrist to my heart has come;\nJesus, the King of Glory,\nFinds in my heart a home.", "chorus Christ in me, Christ in me,\nChrist in me, O wonderful story,\nChrist in me, Christ in me,\nChrist in me, the hope of glory.", "2 Was there e'er story so moving,\nStory of love and pain;\nWas there e'er Bridegroom so loving,\nSeeking our hearts to gain.", "3 I am so glad I received Him,\nJesus my heart's dear King;\nI who so often have grieved Him,\nAll to His feet would bring.", "4 How can I ever be lonely,\nHow can I ever fall;\nWhat can I want, if only\nChrist is my all in all?", "5 Now in His bosom confiding,\nThis my glad song shall be;\nI am in Christ abiding,\nAnd Christ abides in me."]
