["1 My Savior, Thou hast offered rest:\nOh, give it then to me;\nThe rest of ceasing from myself,\nTo find my all in Thee.", "2 This cruel self, oh, how it strives\nAnd works within my breast,\nTo come between Thee and my soul,\nAnd keep me back from rest.", "3 How many subtle forms it takes\nOf seeming verity,\nAs if it were not safe to rest\nAnd venture all on Thee.", "4 O Lord, I seek a holy rest,\nA victory over sin;\nI seek that Thou alone shouldst reign\nO'er all without, within.", "5 In Thy strong hand I lay me down,\nSo shall the work be done;\nFor who can work so wondrously\nAs the Almighty One?", "6 Work on, then, Lord, till on my soul\nEternal light shall break,\nAnd, in Thy likeness perfected,\nI \"satisfied\" shall wake."]
