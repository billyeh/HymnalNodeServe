["1 Fill me with Thy gracious Spirit,\nFill my longing spirit now;\nFill me with Thy hallowed presence,\nCome, dear Lord, and fill me now!", "chorus Fill me now! Fill me now!\nFill me with Thy Spirit now!\nStrip me wholly, empty throughly,\nFill me with Thy Spirit now!", "2 Thou can'st fill me with Thy Spirit,\nThough I cannot tell Thee how;\nBut I need Thee, greatly need Thee;\nCome, dear Lord, and fill me now!", "3 I am weakness, full of weakness;\nAt Thy sacred feet I bow;\nBy Thy blest, eternal Spirit,\nFill with strength, and fill me now!", "4 Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me;\nFill my broken spirit now!\nThou art comforting and saving,\nThou art sweetly filling now."]
