["1 In new heaven and new earth,\nNew Jerusalem lies;\nOut of God it has its birth\nWith God's radiance thrice.", "chorus Lo, God's image it doth bear\nAnd God's glory it doth share!\nAnd the Lord Himself is there,\nIn that city of God.", "2 All the gates are pearls assigned,\nIn the city of gold\nAnd the street is gold refined,\nWith foundations twelvefold.", "3 There life's crystal river flows,\nWith abundant supplies\nAnd the tree of life there grows,\nAnd all need satisfies.", "4 God is there the great I AM,\nIn that city of light;\nGod's the light within the Lamb\nAnd there never is night."]
