["1 Lord, Thou art with me!\nWhom shall I fear?\nWho then can harm me\nWhile Thou art near?\nUnder Thy shadow\nIs my retreat;\nThere to my taste,\nLord, Thy fruit is sweet.", "2 Lord, Thou art with me,\nAnd Thou dost give\nStrength for the journey,\nGrace now to live.\nMercies each morning\nThou dost renew;\nAnd for my prospect,\nThy rest in view.", "3 Lord, Thou art with me;\nOnward:I move;\nEach day I'm proving\nMore of Thy love.\nNow Thou art training,\nSetting me free\nFrom all that hinders,\nTo dwell with Thee."]
