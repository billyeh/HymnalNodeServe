["1 Does Jesus care when my heart is pained\nToo deeply for mirth or song,\nAs the burdens press,\nAnd the cares distress,\nAnd the way grows weary and long?", "chorus O yes, He cares, I know He cares,\nHis heart is touched with my grief;\nWhen the days are weary,\nThe long night dreary,\nI know my Savior cares.", "2 Does Jesus care when my way is dark\nWith a nameless dread and fear?\nAs the daylight fades\nInto deep night shades,\nDoes He care enough to be near?", "3 Does Jesus care when I've tried and failed\nTo resist some temptation strong;\nWhen for my deep grief\nThere is no relief,\nThough my tears flow all the night long?", "4 Does Jesus care when I've said \"goodbye\"\nTo the dearest on earth to me,\nAnd my sad heart aches\nTill it nearly breaks,\nIs it aught to Him? Does He see?"]
