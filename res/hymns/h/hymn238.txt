["1 When morning gilds the skies,\nMy heart awaking cries:\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!\nAlike at work and prayer\nTo Jesus I repair:\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!", "2 To Thee, my God above,\nI cry with glowing love,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!\nThe fairest graces spring\nIn hearts that ever sing,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!", "3 Does sadness fill my mind?\nA solace here I find,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!\nOr fades my earthly bliss?\nMy comfort still is this,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!", "4 When evil thoughts molest,\nWith this I shield my breast,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!\nThe powers of darkness fear,\nWhen this sweet chant they hear,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!", "5 When sleep her balm denies,\nMy silent spirit sighs,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!\nThe night becomes as day,\nWhen from the heart we say,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!", "6 Be this, while life is mine,\nMy canticle divine,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!\nBe this th' eternal song\nThrough all the ages long,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!"]
