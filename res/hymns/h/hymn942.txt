["1 God's Kingdom on the earth is now,\nHis sovereign government within;\n'Tis Christ Himself in us to live,\nAs Lord and King to rule and reign.", "2 His life with His authority,\nEnthrones Him now within our hearts,\nTo govern all our words and deeds,\nAnd regulate our inward parts.", "3 The Lord enthroned within our hearts,\nHis Kingdom doth establish there\nAssuring His full right to reign,\nAnd for God's purpose to prepare.", "4 'Tis by His reign within our hearts,\nThat life to us He e'er supplies;\nWhen taking Him as Lord and King\nHis wealth our being satisfies.", "5 'Tis by His ruling from within,\nHis fulness vast is testified;\n'Tis when His inner kingdom rules,\nHis Body's blessed and edified.", "6 'Tis by His heav'nly rule within,\nAs heav'nly citizens we live;\n'Tis by submission to His rule,\nExpression of His reign we give.", "7 Here in this heav'nly realm we live\nAnd with this heav'nly pow'r possessed,\nWe walk and fight in heav'nly light,\nUntil the Kingdom's manifest."]
