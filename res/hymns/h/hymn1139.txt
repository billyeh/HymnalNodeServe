["1 I will get me to the mountain,\nI will get me to the hill;\nIn Thy death and resurrection,\nJesus, take me deeper still.", "chorus I will get me to the mountain,\nWillingly would get me there.\nAll my self fore'er forsaking,\nOne with Thee, O Lord,\nThy death to share.", "2 Still at times I sense the shadows\nOf my nature, untransformed;\nLord, I'll go unto the mountain,\nTo Thy death to be conformed.", "3 On the mountain till the daybreak,\nLinger I, Lord, thus with Thee,\nMay Thy all-transforming Spirit\nSaturate me thoroughly.", "4 Mingled with Thee on the mountain,\nSoon my sun begins to shine;\nDeath has worked her deep impression,\nNow my nature's one with Thine."]
