["1 I'm pressing on the upward way,\nNew heights I'm gaining every day;\nStill praying as I onward bound,\n\"Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.\"", "chorus Lord, lift me up, and let me stand\nBy faith on Canaan's tableland;\nA higher plane than I have found,\nLord, plant my feet on higher ground.", "2 My heart has no desire to stay\nWhere doubts arise and fears dismay;\nThough some may dwell where these abound,\nMy prayer, my aim, is higher ground.", "3 I want to live above the world,\nThough Satan's darts at me are hurled;\nFor faith has caught the joyful sound,\nThe song of saints on higher ground.", "4 I want to scale the utmost height\nAnd catch a gleam of glory bright;\nBut still I'll pray till rest I've found,\n\"Lord, lead me on to higher ground.\""]
