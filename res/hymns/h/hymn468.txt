["1 Am I a soldier of the Cross-\nA follower of the Lamb?\nAnd shall I fear to own His cause,\nOr blush to speak His name?", "chorus In the name, the precious name,\nOf Him who died for me,\nThrough grace I'll win the promised crown,\nWhate'er my cross may be.", "2 Must I be carried to the skies\nOn flowery beds of ease,\nWhile others fought to win the prize\nAnd sailed through bloody seas?", "3 Are there no foes for me to face?\nMust I not stem the flood?\nIs this vile world a friend to grace,\nTo help me on to God?", "4 Since I must fight if I would reign,\nIncrease my courage, Lord!\nI'll bear the toil, endure the pain,\nSupported by Thy Word."]
