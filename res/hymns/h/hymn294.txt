["1 Gone from my heart the world and all its charms;\nNow through the blood I'm saved from all alarms;\nDown at the cross my heart is bending low;\nThe precious blood of Jesus cleanses white as snow.", "chorus I love Him, I love Him,\nBecause He first loved me,\nAnd purchased my salvation on Calv'ry's tree.", "2 Once I was lost, and fallen deep in sin;\nOnce was a slave to passions fierce within;\nOnce was afraid to meet an angry God,\nBut now I'm cleansed from every stain thro' Jesus' blood.", "3 Once I was bound, but now I am set free;\nOnce I was blind, but now the light I see;\nOnce I was dead, but now in Christ I live,\nTo tell the world around the peace that He doth give."]
