["1 Lord, day by day I view Thy wondrous Cross\nOn Calvary!\nAnd day by day I stretch my hands thereon\nAnd die with Thee.", "2 I \"glory in the Cross\" most loving Lord,\nBecause I know\nIt is the power to save and satisfy,\nWhere'er I go.", "3 The daily Cross becomes the deepest joy,\nFor just beyond\nThe Cross, I clearly see how Cross and Crown\nDo correspond.", "4 Oh, gracious Lord, how sweet to take from Thee\nThe daily Cross!\nAnd know that I can never separate\nIts gain and loss.", "5 The daily Cross is daily loss to all\nThat keeps from Thee;\nThe daily Cross is daily gain of all\nThou art for me."]
