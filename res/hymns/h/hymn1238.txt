["1 Never did I dream before,\nSuch a place could e'er be found,\nWhere the tears of sorrow cease,\nSongs of endless joy abound.\nOne who seldom ever sang,\nNow delights his voice to raise;\nSinging hymns with all the saints,\nEchoing the ceaseless praise.", "2 Day by day the world goes on,\nJust as it has gone before.\nMillions grasp and clutch at life,\nWond'ring if there could be more;\nSuch was I and would be, yet\nMercy found me out somehow;\nWith what gratefulness I say,\n\"I'm in God's own family now.\"", "3 How delightful 'tis to know;\nHow subjective, real, and sweet\nIs this inward joy of grace\nWe experience when we meet;\nLife abundant Jesus gives\nAs my full reality;\nPraise You, Lord, it's really true,\nI'm in Your own family.", "4 At the closing of this age,\nJust before Your kingdom's dawn,\nMay You gain a people, Lord,\nFor Your dwelling place, Your home.\nSince for me You gave Your all,\nEverything I lay aside;\nFor Your church my all I'd give,\nThat You would be satisfied."]
