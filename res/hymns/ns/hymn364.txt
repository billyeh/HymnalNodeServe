["1 Our condition was dead in offenses,\nTo the flesh we were enslaved.\nBut together with Christ Jesus He has raised us,\nBy His grace we have been saved. [Eph. 2\":2-6]\n\nGod, Your mercy and Your love have reached us,\nYou have made us alive.\nBy Your Spirit entering our spirit,\nIn Your life we've been revived. [Eph. 2\":4-5]", "2 We were once far off but have become near\nIn the blood of the dear Son.\nIn His flesh abolished all the ordinances,\nThus creating two as one. [Eph. 2\":13, 15]\n\nWe have access directly to the Father\nThrough Christ Jesus, our Lord\nIn one Spirit, whether Jew or Gentile,\nFellowship has been restored. [Eph. 2\":18]", "3 Make the prayer that Paul had in Ephesians\nThe prayer in our daily plan.\nFather strengthen us with power through Your Spirit,\nDeep into the inner man. [Eph. 3\":16]\n\nLord, keep spreading into every corner,\nLord, keep gaining each part.\nWe allow you to have the room within us.\nMake Your home in all our heart. [Eph. 3\":17]", "4 Lord, Your riches are so unsearchable.\nI can never comprehend. \nBut with all the saints in such a corporate church life\nYour dimensions apprehend. [Eph. 3\":8, 18-19]\n\nBy Your mercy, keep me in Your Body,\nTaking the rich supply.\nThrough each member's function in their measure\nAll the Body edify. [Eph. 4\":16]", "5 Deep within You is the greatest mystery,\nOne that countless men have searched.\nBut to us You have unveiled the revelation,\nNow we see Christ and the church. [Eph. 5\":32]\n\nLord, we're wholly for Your heart's desire-\nMake Your church sanctified.\nThrough the washing in the pure word's water\nMay You gain Your glorious Bride. [Eph. 5\":25-26]"]
