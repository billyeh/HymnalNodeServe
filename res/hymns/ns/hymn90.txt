["1 How could this age be so dark, Lord?\nAll around persecute You.\nThough cruel religion would slay You,\nNo one takes thought or concern.\nWhile Your heart ached for God's chosen,\nWe were just lepers You cleansed.\nWhile they reject Your speaking,\nWe were the dead ones You raised.\nWhile they despised Your Person,\nWe are the grateful You saved.\n\nLord, we're so glad to be\nThe house in Bethany.\nWe bid You rest and eat,\nCome, we've prepared for Thee.", "2 Safe in this house, Lord You're cherished,\nWe treasure You above all!\nWe grasp the chance to be with You,\nYour presence our greatest joy.\nComfort Your heart with our tears, Lord,\nWash the world's hatred away.\nMay we serve You a meal, Lord?\nMay we share in Your trial?\nMay we prepare Your Body?\nMay our love satisfy.\n\nOh! We are blessed to be,\nYour house in Bethany.\nSharing Your table, we\nFocus our gaze on Thee.", "3 Lord, in our eyes You are worthy,\nAnd what we have, Lord, we give.\nBreaking our flask we anoint Thee,\nWhat is most precious we spend.\nAll our heart's ointment so costly,\nLord, we pour out on Thee.\nMay all the house be filled, Lord,\nWith fragrance sweet to Thee.\nMay Your whole church then hunger,\nWith more desire for Thee.\n\nLord, may we always be,\nWith You in Bethany.\nOur free will offering,\nThe best, poured out on Thee."]
