["1 We have found a simple way for us to really touch the Lord:\nAll we do is pray four words, and O what grace He does afford!\nFrom our spirit now we say them, and we spread the news abroad,\nIt's easy to touch the Lord!", "chorus Oh Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!\nOh Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!\nOh Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!\nIt's easy to touch the Lord!"]
