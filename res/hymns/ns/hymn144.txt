["chorus Our spirit is our organ to receive God.\nSo every day, all the time, we must exercise,\nExercise this organ to take the word.\nIn this way, we receive life.\nThis is the experience of life.\nThe experience of life is just to exercise,\nExercise our spirit\nTo eat the word that we may receive life.\nAfter being received by us\nThis life will live out all kind of\nDivine, spiritual, and heavenly things\nIn an unlimited way."]
