["1 To You, dear Lord,\nI give myself afresh again\nUnsparingly for Your desire,\nYour economy.", "2 O, fire from above,\nCome and consume me thoroughly\nThat You may be my all,\nMy life, my everything.", "3 It's Your mercy and Your love\nThat I can give myself to You.\nSince it's in like manner\nThat You gave up Yourself for me.", "4 Set Your throne in my heart\nFrom now on to the very end.\nIt takes eternity to know its worth\nTo You, to me."]
