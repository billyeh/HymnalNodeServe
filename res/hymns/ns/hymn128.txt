["1 Draw me, dear Lord, with Your beauty,\nCapture my heart till earth fades away.\nI need Your love to attract me\nSo I can love You more today.", "2 Empty me, Lord, how I need You!\nUnclog my mind, emotion, and will.\nAll that I have, I abandon\nSo You can fill my heart today.", "3 Oh fill me now with Your life, Lord,\nFlood my whole being with rivers divine.\nI open wide; what enjoyment!\nTo live Your life, dear Lord, as mine."]
