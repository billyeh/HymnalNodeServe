["1 With the kisses of Your mouth,\nHave You kissed me, Lord.\nFrom Your kisses flows a fountain,\nFrom a depth unknown.\nGently tempered by Your touching\nOf my deepest chords,\nMy heart's renewed with gladness,\nAnd my love o'erflows.", "2 Let me kiss You, drink You deeper,\nFully satisfy\nAll the longings deep within me,\nFor Your presence nigh,\nAnd a deeper, sweeter union,\nOf Your life with mine\nThat our natures fully mingled,\nWould our hearts entwine.", "3 Ever increase, Lord, within me,\nMy desire for You.\nLet Your kisses ever kiss me,\nAnd that I'd kiss You.\nDear Lord Jesus, may I ever be,\nSo betrothed to You.\nMay I love You, always love You,\nAnd respond to You.\nMay I love You, always love You,\nAnd respond to You."]
