["chorus Abide in Me, and I in you,\nAs the branch cannot bear fruit\nOf itself unless\nIt abides in the vine,\nSo neither can you\nUnless you abide in Me.", "1 I am the vine,\nYou are the branches,\nHe who abides in Me and I in him.\nHe bears much fruit\nFor apart from Me you can do nothing.", "2 If you abide in Me and my words abide in you\nAsk whatever you will and it will be done for you.\nWhen we abide in the Lord and let His words abide in us,\nWe actually are one with Him as He works within us.\nThen when we ask in prayer for whatever we will\nIt is not only we who are praying\nHe too is praying, in our praying.\nThis kind of prayer is related to fruit bearing\nand will surely be answered.", "3 You did not choose Me, but I chose you and I set you.\nThat you should go forth and bear fruit,\nAnd that your fruit should remain,\nThat whatever you ask the Father in my name,\nHe may give you."]
