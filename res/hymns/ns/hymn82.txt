["1 I once was dead-dead in my sins;\nBehaved myself in lust of flesh.\nBy nature such a child of wrath,\nEven as the rest.", "2 But God being so merciful\nBecause of His great love to me\nEnlivened me I'm now in Christ\nSeated in the heavenlies.", "3 But that's not all! I'm with the saints.\nTogether we're His workmanship,\nHis masterpiece expressing Him\nIn the heavens and on earth.", "4 I was once apart from Christ, you know;\nAlien from the wealth of Israel;\nNot a hope-not even one to tell,\nWithout God in the world.", "5 Now in Christ He has become my peace;\nBy the blood of Christ I am released.\nI am one with all the saints, since He's\nBroken down the middle wall.", "6 He has died creating one new man.\nThus fulfilling God's eternal plan.\nWith all saints together, let us stand,\nShout and sing and praise the Lord!"]
