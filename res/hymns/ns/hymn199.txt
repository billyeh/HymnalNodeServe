["1 Nearer each day to me,\nDearer each day to me,\nThis Person inside me is\nBecoming reality.\nSaving me, loving me,\nFaith and hope giving me.\nYou're all the world to me Jesus, my Lord.", "2 Even when faith is small,\nWhen there's no hope at all,\nI hear Him say to me,\nTrust in Me and you'll see,\nThat I'll supply all your needs,\nIf only you will believe.\nAll anxious doubts will cease,\nWhile trusting in Me."]
