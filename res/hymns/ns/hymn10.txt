["1 Before you get the answer, you get the Answer;\nBefore you get the things you ask for, you get the One;\nBefore you get the object, you get the Person;\nBefore you get the answer, you get the Lord.", "chorus Cast all your anxiety with Him.\nGive them, commit them, throw them once for all.\nThrow your whole life with all its cares on Him\nBecause it matters to Him concerning you."]
