["1 There are times in my life\nWhen my heart is embittered.\nThere are questions unanswered,\nYet, You're drawing me", "chorus To enter\nInto Your blessed sanctuary\nAnd turning my eyes heavenward,\nThe questions of constant inquiry\nAre changed to these words,", "2 \"Whom do I have in heaven\nBut You, dear Jehovah.\nMy flesh and my heart\nConstantly fail,", "chorus But God's still\nThe strength of my heart and my portion;\nTo Him forever I'll draw near.\nI've made Jehovah my sweet refuge.\nSo now throughout the years", "3 Turn my view to see You,\nHow I need to see Jesus!!\nThough I don't understand\nThe ways that You take;", "chorus Lord, make me\nA babe and suckling always praising.\nEnjoying Your worth day by day.\nLet each experience constitute me\nSo Your life I'll display\nIn every way."]
