["1 What things were gains to me,\nThese I now count as loss.\nJesus has set me free\nFrom what I was!\nAll of the things I had;\nEverything, good or bad,\nI count as refuse\nThat I may gain Christ!", "chorus I won't give up!\nI will keep running until\nI have attained\nThe goal of my calling!\nI must press on!\nI must pursue until\nI lay hold of Him\nWho laid hold of me!", "2 Forget the things behind!\nStretch for the things before!\nPress onward with this mind:\nAlways want more!\nSeeking in Him to grow,\nIncreasingly to know\nHim that I daily might\nBe found in Christ."]
