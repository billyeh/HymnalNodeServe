["1 If you are hungry, come to the feast.\nOpen to Jesus-He is all you need.\nHe fed the thousands, now He'll feed you.\nJust open your mouth and take Him in-\nThat's all you have to do.\nWe've found that calling on Jesus fills us within.\nHe came as food, so now we take Him in.\nNo doctrines or forms that you have to learn\nTo come and meet with us.\nJust enjoy the Lord Jesus!", "2 If you are thirsty, He's heard your cry.\nHe is a fountain that will not run dry.\nHe's quenching our longings, we're satisfied,\nJust eating and drinking the risen Lord!\nYes, that is why He died;\nSo He could become the Spirit, get into us,\nFill all our being-Oh, how glorious!\nIt's really so simple-just take and eat;\nThat's all you have to do.\nCome enjoy the Lord Jesus."]
