["1 O my God, within Thee there is eternal life\nAnd this life is expressed in the Son\nHe has risen, today, as the Spirit of life\nWhich in us quickens us, gives us life.", "2 O behold, from the throne of our God and the Lamb\nFlows a river of water of life\nGod the source, Christ the fount, God the Spirit the flow,\nSpringing up as a river of life.", "3 Jesus Lord, from my spirit I turn unto Thee\nOpen wide, call Thy name, drink Thee in;\nDearest Lord, to this stream I outpour utterly;\nTriune God, flow as life, flood my being."]
