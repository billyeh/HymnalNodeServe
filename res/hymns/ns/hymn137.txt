["1 I won't say goodbye\nOr even think about all that I've left behind.\nThis world is worthless in my mind;\nI've crossed the great divide;\nNo looking back, there's no way back to my old life.\nTo Christ I come, to Christ I go.", "chorus I died to this world, but then He raised me, lifted to\nThe heavenly\nAnd there I find His perfect peace; God and I live in\nHarmony.\nRiver of life, flowing freely.\nHere I'll drink, and drink, and drink, and drink from\nNow to Eternity.", "2 Raining day and night\nWhile water rise, I'm safe inside my Christ the ark.\nThis world is buried 'neath the dark,\nI've stepped into the light.\nHis word I see, I trace the rainbow through the sky.\nTo Christ I come, to Christ I go."]
