["chorus Christ is everything, I need Him.\nHe is everything you need, believe Him.\nLife is a person, receive Him,\nOpen up your heart and sing.", "1 Open yourself to the new creation.\nOpen your eyes to the joy of change.\nLife is a fruit of God's creation.\nEvery new birth is a soul regained.", "2 Drinking His life from a silver fountain.\nSweet water running inside of me.\nOh, how I love to live on the mountain,\nEver since Jesus set me free.", "3 Follow the Lord like a charging stallion.\nRace for the Son with all your might.\nGuard your heart like a gold medallion,\nKeep the kingdom full in sight."]
