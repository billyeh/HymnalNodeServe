["1 You fill me Lord Jesus\nYou enlighten my darkness;\nYour life brings me freedom\nYour love heals my pain\nYour dream is my treasure;\nYour majesty awes me\nYou've filled me Lord Jesus\nCome fill me again.", "2 Let Your north wind blow on me,\nLet Your Spirit surround me\n'Til my being is open, trusting You once again.\nThen burn and consume me\nWith Your jealous God's fire\n'Til me being is obedient,\n'Til my soul You have gained.", "3 I will turn my heart to You;\nSeal and pledge Yourself in me.\nMingle with me completely\nLike the fire in the flame;\nTil my being is glowing;\nYour workmanship showing;\nI will turn my heart to You\nAgain and again."]
