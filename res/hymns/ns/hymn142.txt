["1 In nothing be anxious,\nBut in everything,\nBy prayer and petition\nWith thanksgiving,\nLet your requests, let your requests\nBe made known to God;\n\nIn nothing be anxious,\nBut in everything,\nBy prayer and petition\nWith thanksgiving,\nLet your requests, let your requests\nBe made known to God;\n\nAnd the peace of God,\nWhich surpasses\nEvery man's understanding,\nWill guard your hearts\nWill guard your thoughts\nIn Christ Jesus."]
