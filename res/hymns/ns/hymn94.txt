["1 To be set free from the bond of sin,\nTo have the joy and peace within,\nTo live a life full of meaning,\nBelieve into Jesus.\nMan's way to please God is religion;\nGod's way is a living Person;\nChrist is God's way of salvation;\nBelieve and you'll be saved.", "chorus It pleases God to rescue us\nOut of this present evil age,\nAnd to reveal His Son in us\nIn life's every stage.", "2 We have received Christ as the Spirit\nThrough faith and not by our merit;\nHaving begun by the Spirit,\nWe learn to live by faith.\nWe now are sons of the living God,\nEnjoying the Blessing of our Lord,\nGrace to our spirit He will afford,\nWe're freed from self-effort.", "3 Oh what a joy! Christ now lives in us;\nNo longer I-how glorious!\nHe is daily growing in us\n'Til He is formed in us.\nLiving and walking by the Spirit,\nEnjoying the fruit of the Spirit;\nTo Him our lives we do commit,\nNot to any vain act."]
