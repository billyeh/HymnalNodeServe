["1 Day one You came to me,\nBrooding so tenderly,\nYou spoke a word to me,\nAnd light did shine.\nMy darkness You effaced,\nMy emptiness replaced,\nThe gospel's light erased\nMy history vain.", "2 Day two did come and go,\nBut one thing I did know,\nThings earthly lost their glow,\nThey're dead to me;\nThe atmosphere expanse,\nLifted my circumstance,\nThat life may thus advance,\nFor growth in me.", "3 Day three the land so dry,\nEmerged from waters high,\nGrass, herbs, and trees did rise,\nYour life had sprung.\nMy death You now received,\nAs life to rise in me,\nRise more 'till there's no sea,\nWithin my being.", "4 Day four the sun did shine,\nWith rays of healing light,\nThe moon was shining too,\nThe church, my home.\nThe saints as stars with light,\nShine 'midst this darkening night,\nSetting my feet aright,\nTo walk Your way.", "5 Day five the fish arrive,\nAgainst the worldly tide,\nDeath waters did survive,\nWith life and power;\nFrom fish to bird I soar,\nI'm waiting on You, Lord,\nYour grace to me afford,\nStrength for all things.", "6 Day six from air to ground,\nCattle and beasts around,\nThen all creation found,\nWith men like these,\nThrough growth expressing Thee,\nWith Your authority,\nI've reached maturity,\nYour purpose gained."]
