["1 There is a great mystery,\nA wonderful story;\nFor ages 'twas hidden,\nNow shown in His wisdom;\n'Tis a divine romance\nOf God and man in time;\nBeyond understanding,\nYet seen in God's speaking.", "chorus God fell in love with man;\nFor only God's love can\nMake man just the same as He\nIn life and in nature.\nWe are His expression,\nHis bride, His enlargement;\nForever, together,\nAs living, insep'rable as one couple\nEternally.", "2 Though He was rejected\nBy men who were blinded;\nHis love is constraining,\nHis heart still unchanging;\nThus in incarnation\nCame He as salvation;\nHis name is called Jesus,\nAnd He came to seek us.", "3 Though born as a sinner,\nHis blood has redeemed me.\nHe suffered on Calv'ry,\nThen raised up in glory,\nTo regenerate me.\nNow joined in one spirit \nI love to enjoy Him,\nFor I've been forgiven!", "4 His love is so tender,\nTo Him I'll surrender;\nHis name is so precious,\nI gladly call, \"Jesus!\"\nHis Person's so charming,\nMy heart ever winning;\nI'll hold back no longer,\nI'll love Him forever."]
