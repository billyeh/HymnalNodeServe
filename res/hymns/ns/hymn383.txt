["nonum These things says the Holy One,\nThe true One, the One who has the key of David,\nThe One who opens, no one will shut,\nAnd shuts and no one opens:", "nonum I know your works;\nBehold, I have put before you an opened door\nWhich no one can shut,\nBecause you have\nA little power,\nHave kept My word,\nHave not denied My name."]
