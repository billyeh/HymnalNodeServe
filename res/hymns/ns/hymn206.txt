["1 Lord, do unveil\nThe more we strive, the more we fail\nAll the strife-they all come out to no avail.\nLord, they're just not for your need\nBy \"self\", we won't succeed.", "2 Lord, we confess\nWe are not able, Lord, unless\nWe have You; You're all in all-You're our success!\nAll we need, O Lord, is You\n'Cause nothing else will do.", "3 O Lord, we pray\nIncrease Thyself in us each day\nAnd the \"self\"-decrease it 'til it's done away.\nLord, we want the growth in life\nWe don't want all the strife.", "4 Lord, life's begun\nTwo spirits mingled into one\nDay by day, walk in the spirit and we've won!\nThen the \"self\" will be decreased\nAnd Christ in us increased."]
