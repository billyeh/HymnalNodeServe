["1 From my heart comes a melody\nOf the One who gave His life for me.\nHow can I turn away from Thee;\nLord, I have seen Thy changeless love for me.\nEnjoyment so full!\nLife's reality!\nThat's what You're to me:\nLord, You have won my heart!\nTake my heart, take my whole life too;\nLord, I can't help giving myself to You.", "2 From the day that I first met You.\nHow could I help falling in love with You?\nEmptiness turned life's pleasures blue;\nNo earthly love ever could see me through.\n'Till I turned one day\nOpened up my heart,\nLet Your love flow in\nAnd fill my deepest part.\nNow I know, Lord, You're one with me;\nAnd I can't help giving myself to Thee.\nLord, I can't help giving myself to Thee."]
