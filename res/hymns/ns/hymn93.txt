["1 I've got a story you should know,\nHappened many years ago,\nLong before this world was known to you or me.\nA man named Jesus came and died,\nOn the cross was crucified.\nThere He gave Himself to set all people free!", "2 You see, this world was lost in sin,\nPeople's hearts were dark within,\nBut God loved us just too much to let us go.\nSo then He sent His only Son\n'Cause He knew he needed One\nWho could rescue all His loved ones here below.", "3 At first nobody would believe,\nAnd they failed to receive\nThe free gift of life that only He could give.\nBut when He died that awful day,\nHe took all our sins away,\nThat to Him we might now look and, thereby, live.", "4 So won't you open from within,\nLet Him take away your sin,\n'Cause He'd like to be your Savior tried and true.\nAnd you will never be the same,\nOnce you call upon His name,\nAnd His wonderful salvation reaches you!"]
