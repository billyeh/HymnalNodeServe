["1 My Savior the good Shepherd is,\nHe'll never leave the flock.\nThe One Who truly loves the sheep,\nBecame the Lamb of God.\nDespised, afflicted in my stead,\nHe spent His soul for me.\nAnd to the slaughter He was led,\nThat I not thirsty be.", "2 My Shepherd is the Lamb of God,\nHe calls to me each day,\nTo drink the waters flowing free,\nFrom His pierced side of grace.\nYet when I stray or choose my way,\nHe still would search for me,\nAnd bring me home on shoulders strong.\nDo I not His love see?", "3 My Shepherd's face is how I live,\nI love to look at Him.\nThough He might lead through shearing trial,\nBut still I follow Him.\nJust as the Father's presence cheered \nHim through each suffering day,\n'Tis once I saw His tender care\nThat here I want to stay.", "4 Oh, Father thank You for Your Son,\nHe shares Your heart for us.\nThat gladly He would bear us to\nThe bosom of Your love.\nNo greater Shepherd could there be,\nThat He would not lose one!\nAnd lead us all to dwell with You.\nSweet Pasture, Living Stream."]
