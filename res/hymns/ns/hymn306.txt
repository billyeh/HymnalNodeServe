["1 The risen Christ my Shepherd is.\nHe graciously my soul doth feed.\nMy Christ is mine, and I am His.\nHow can I lack or e'er have need?", "2 In pastures green He makes me lie.\nMy soul He satisfies always,\nThe restful water leads me by,\nIn fellowship and perfect peace.", "3 I often stray; He seeketh me\nTo yield my heart to His control.\nFor His name's sake He leadeth me\nAnd shepherds my oft-shaken soul.", "4 Incredible the thought beside-\nPursuing Thee all care is stilled.\nThy rod and staff support and guide;\nMy way is with Thy presence filled.", "5 Emboldened in Thy victory,\nI feast surrounded by my foes,\nMy head anointed bountifully,\nMy cup with blessings overflows.", "6 Thy love the measure of my days,\nThy grace a boundless treasure store;\nGood Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise\nWithin Thy house forevermore."]
