["chorus Lord, I thank You for another new day to live You;\nAnother day for me to practise being one spirit with You.\nRemind me this whole day to reject my self,\nNot to trust myself,\nAnd not to live by myself.\nStrengthen me to live by You.\nMake this a day for me to live You out.\nTaking You as my everything,\nAbiding in You as a branch in the vine."]
