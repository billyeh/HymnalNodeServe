["1 Throughout the past twenty centuries\nTens of thousands of precious lives,\nHeart treasures, high positions,\nAnd golden futures have been \"wasted\"\nUpon the Lord Jesus.\nTo the ones who love Him in such a way\nHe is altogether lovely and worthy of their offering.\nWhat they have poured upon the Lord is not a waste\nBut a fragrant testimony of His sweetness.\nWhat they have poured upon the Lord is not a waste\nBut a fragrant testimony of His sweetness."]
