["1 Our Christ is so enjoyable,\nHis life is so applicable;\nHe lives in us to cause the flow\nTo reach the world, His life to show.\nDon't just sit here and be idle;\nRise up! Your gift-don't belittle;\nLet's eat and drink of this sweet Christ!", "chorus Let's enjoy Christ to reach the goal,\nPartake of Him to beat the foe,\nAll His vast riches we extol,\nYes, we are freed from every woe!\nWe may not know a lot of things,\nBut we are kept from Satan's stings\nBy eating Christ, and Christ alone!", "2 We all can do so many things,\nBut first of all to Christ we'll cling;\nEnjoy Him first, blessings He'll bring,\nHis life-supply means everything!\nEnjoy Him-grace He will bestow,\nAnd we'll be led to join the flow;\nYes, we will do all things in Him."]
