["1 We don't care where you come from,\nWe don't care where you would go.\nSince we meet in the Lord,\nLet us all meet joyfully.\nThings may come to discourage\nAnd they leave you somewhat sad;\nLet it all go, let it go!\nAnd let's sing a melody.", "chorus Welcome here, our dear friend,\nWe're so glad that you have come,\nHere we all love you,\nAnd the Lord loves you most.\nIn the church we need you now,\nEverything here is for you.\nWe wait for you to return,\nJust remember that we'll think of you.", "2 Won't you cast off your burdens,\nPut aside all your restraints,\nSing a song full of joy,\nBreathe in the refreshing air\nLet's enjoy holy feelings\nSavour sweetness and repose \nLet's bring home peace and this joy\nSo we'll never be distressed."]
