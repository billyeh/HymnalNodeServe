["1 Jehovah is my Shepherd; I will lack nothing.\nHe makes me lie down in green pastures;\nHe leads me beside waters of rest.\nHe restores my soul; He guides me on the paths\nOf righteousness for His name's sake.\nYour rod and staff comfort me.\nThough I walk through death's valley\nI fear no evil, for You are with me.\nYou spread a feast before me,\nYou anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over.\nGoodness and lovingkindness\nWill follow me always,\nI will dwell in the house of Jehovah\nFor the length of my days."]
