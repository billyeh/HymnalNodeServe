["1 Early in the morning,\nMeeting with the saints,\nGather the fresh manna,\nTake in His rich grace!", "chorus Christ in all the saints,\nLiving, fresh and new.\nBlending with each other,\nTasting morning dew!", "2 Singing songs together,\nSpirits exercised.\nDrawing from each other,\nChrist is realized!", "3 Reading in the Bible,\nEach one taking turns;\nFellowship together,\nHow our spirit burns!", "4 Praying for our loved ones,\nBring them to the throne.\nChrist desires to save them,\nBringing them all home!", "5 Morning, noon and evening,\nGath'ring with the saints;\nJoy in each one's presence,\nTaking in fresh grace."]
