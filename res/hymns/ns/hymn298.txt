["chorus The love of Christ is Christ Himself.\nJust as Christ is immeasurable,\nSo also is His love;\nHence, it is knowledge surpassing.\nYet we can know it by experiencing it.", "chorus When Christ makes His home in our hearts,\nAnd when we are full of strength to apprehend\nWith all the saints the dimensions of Christ\nAnd to know by experience His knowledge surpassing love,\nWe will be filled unto all the fullness of God,\nWhich is the church, the corporate expression of God\nFor the fulfillment of His intention."]
