["1 Mary poured out her love offering\nTo many such love was a waste.\nThroughout all of the centuries\nSuch lovers Your sweetness do taste.\nPrecious lives and heart treasures, too\nPositions and golden futures,\nHave been \"wasted\" on You, Lord;\nYour sweetness a fragrance so sure.\nShe took opportunity\nTo love You; Lord, with her best.\nLike her, Lord, I too would pour\nMy love and all that I have.", "2 As I love You I set my being-\nMy spirit, my soul and body.\nWith my heart, my mind, and my strength,\nAbsolutely on Thee.\nLord, I let my entire being\nBe occupied by Thee\nAs I enter in Your heart\nI sense a fellowship sweet.\nOccupied and lost in You;\nMy Lord, You're my everything.\nFellowship so intimate;\nIn spirit Lord I enjoy Thee.", "3 Lord there's none in heav'n nor on earth\nThat I desire but Thee.\nThough my heart and flesh faileth, Lord,\nThou ever my portion will be.\nAll is vanity, all is dung;\nI count all other things loss;\nEverything else drains my love\nBut You have captured my heart.\nLord, I've seen Thy preciousness,\nThy worth, Thy reality.\nNow, my Lord, I must confess\nMy heart is only for Thee."]
