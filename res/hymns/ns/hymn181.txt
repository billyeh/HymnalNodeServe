["1 God's economy and His eternal plan,\nHis heart's desire and intention is to be one with man.\nYet man has failed completely throughout all history.\nBut hallelujah! Praise the Lord! God's life is now in me.", "2 Now this life in me is flowing as the river of water of life,\nWashing away all my sins, my cares, and all my strife.\nThis life is overcoming situations in my day.\nHallelujah! Praise the Lord! For this is what I pray:", "chorus Lord Jesus, I love You!\nI give You the preeminence in what I do.\nEnjoying You is the overcoming way.\nThank You for Your recovery; Your Word we will obey.", "3 Thank You for our situations and the environments we are in.\nThat we'd turn to You in all things, and turn away from sin.\nWe'd drop all our anxieties and put our trust in You.\nAnd experience this living One whose life is ever new.", "4 Now the church life is so precious with all the saints so dear.\nEnjoying all Your riches, our vision is so clear,\nThat all would prophesy of Christ from what they've seen,\nAccording to Your scripture in First Corinthians fourteen."]
