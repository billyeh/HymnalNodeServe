["nonum But holding to truth in love\nWe may grow up in all things\nInto Him who is the Head\nChrist is the Head\nOut from Whom all the Body\nBeing joined together and\nBeing knit together through\nEv'ry joint of the rich supply\nAnd through the operation\nIn the measure of each one part\nof each one part\nCauses the growth of the Body unto the\nbuilding up of itself in love,\nin love, in love."]
