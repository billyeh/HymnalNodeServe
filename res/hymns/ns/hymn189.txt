["1 The issue of the third fall of man,\nThe withdrawing of the Holy Spirit;\nThe coming flood to destroy mankind,\nBut Noah found grace in the eyes of Jehovah:\nLord, make me like Noah,\nFinding grace every day.\nGrace is God Himself enjoyed by us\nThrough our cooperation\nBy calling, \"Oh Lord Jesus.\""]
