["1 I've found the One who's all to me;\nHe's become reality.\nNow He's in my life to stay;\nHe is the truth, the life, the way.", "chorus And Jesus is the One who came\nDown to earth to bear our shame,\nBut that's not all, He lives in me.\nOnce I was blind, but now I see.", "2 Now through His life we have the flow,\nShowing us the way to go;\nKeeping us in unity,\nAnd this is His recovery.", "3 Now Jesus is the Lord of all;\nOn His name we all must call.\nThen our spirits find release,\nAnd thus our hearts have found real peace."]
