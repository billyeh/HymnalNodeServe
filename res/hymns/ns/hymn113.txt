["1 Bless me, Lord, with days and nights\nOf talks alone with Thee,\nWith hours and minutes, moments too\nThat I would thus know Thee.", "2 Bless me with Thy presence sweet,\nFor I have naught but Thee;\nYea, nothing left but Thee Thyself,\nLord, give Thyself to me.", "3 Bless me with Thy shining light\nAnd deal with every part.\nThat I would unreserved be\nA channel of Thine heart.", "4 Bless Thee, Lord, forevermore;\nCome in these days between\n'Til I one day I am as Thou art\nAnd Morning Star be seen."]
