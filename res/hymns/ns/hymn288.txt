["chorus Lord, keep my heart open and soft toward You.\nLord, draw my eyes to see nothing else but You.", "chorus Whatever may happen,\nI know You want to gain my heart.\nThough I may not understand,\nJust keep dispensing into my every part.", "chorus Make me a believer\nBy looking at You.\nStanding on Your Word,\nFaithful and true.", "note (Parts 1 & 2 may be sung together, then join last verse in unison.)"]
