["1 Lord, I still love You,\nThough it seems, sometimes, hard to do.\nSo many things, in all my life\nI do not understand. Oh my Lord,\nI need You. I love You.", "2 Lord, the church-Your Bride,\nYou've included me-qualified!\nSo, in the whole wide world,\nMy city, home, and heart-Spread dear Lord,\nHouse to house, for whom You've died."]
