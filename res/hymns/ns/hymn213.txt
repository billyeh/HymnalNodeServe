["chorus Reading the Bible-\nI love the Word of God!\nReading the Bible-\nI love the Word of God!", "1 Every verse reveals Yourself to me,\nEvery line conveys reality.\nWhen I pray the words that You breathed out\nYou become so real to me.", "2 As I read, I pray, as I pray, I read,\nMingling both as one spontaneously.\nYou respond within with words so sweet,\nI repeat these words to Thee.", "3 I'm a newborn babe-it's the milk I need,\nNot the knowledge of the dead teaching.\nWhen I eat Your word, it becomes to me\nMy heart's joy and rejoicing.", "4 Sweeter than honey, precious more than gold;\nIt will not be void, but as the rain and snow,\nIt will do Your will-bear the life divine,\nBearing fruit a hundred-fold.", "5 When my heart is like a rock so cold,\nIt's Your word so strong that hammers stone,\nThat the grain of life may come to me\nAnd supply me inwardly.", "6 It's my food, my drink, and my life supply;\nI love to eat it every day and night.\nI just turn and open up to Him,\nAnd the rivers flow right in."]
