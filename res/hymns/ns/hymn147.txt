["1 I was in a world of misery\nIn this crooked and perverted generation;\nBut the Lord has call me there one day\nAnd now I'm living in this new generation.", "chorus Oh, what a wonderful story\nOf me and my glorious Lord.\nTogether we make our history;\nA mingling of God and of man-\nBecoming the New Jerusalem,\nFull of God's glory. Hallelujah!", "2 The Lord has regenerated me,\nCalling me out of Satan's kingdom into Him;\nDay by day, He is renewing me,\nSanctifying, transforming me to be like Him.", "3 Lord, help me to live a God-man life\nAt home, with the saints, or wherever I would be;\nTaking Christ, living Christ as my life\nExercising forbearance without anxiety.", "4 I want to be an overcomer\nO Lord, I consecrate myself to You right now.\nO Lord, make me an overcomer-\nToday and for the rest of my days here on earth."]
