["nonum Search me, O God, and know my heart;\nTry me and know my thoughts;\nAnd see if there be any wicked way in me;\nLead me in the way, lead me in the way,\nLead me in the way everlasting.", "nonum You have searched me;\nYou have known me;\nMy downsitting, my uprising;\nYou understand my thoughts from afar;\nYou know all my ways,\nYou know all my ways.\n(Two parts can be sung simultaneously)"]
