["1 O the joy of having nothing and being nothing, seeing nothing\nBut a living Christ in glory,\nAnd being careful for nothing but His interests down here.\nWhom have I in heaven but Thee?\nAnd there is none upon the earth that I desire beside Thee.\nO the joy of having nothing and being nothing, seeing nothing\nBut a living Christ in glory,\nAnd being careful for nothing but His interests down here."]
