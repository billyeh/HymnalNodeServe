["1 Have you realized before the foundation of the world\nYou were marked out?\nYou cannot escape God's hand,\nEven though you've tried a number of times.\nThe more you try, the stronger He grasps you,\nWherever you go, He is there!\nOh we'll never rest, 'till we love Him the best,\nThis lovely One-has us in His heart.", "2 It is also by Your mercy we've seen\nSomething so deep in Your heart.\nYou came to earth and sold all You had\nTo buy this great pearl of worth.\nOh save me Lord, from chasing vanity,\nFrom selfish dreams, from all that's binding me-\nThere's nothing so high in this universe\nAs giving ourselves-for what's on Your heart.", "3 You have purposed in time that You'll build Your church\nThat nothing prevails over her.\nAs we flee to meet with the saints,\nYou're building Christ into our hearts.\nOh this is not an outward activity!\nA meaningful life, one day all men will see-\nOh Lord stir our hearts, to never depart,\nTo give all we are-for Christ and the church."]
