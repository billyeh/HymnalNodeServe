["1 Oh listen to a story of abounding grace\nOf how our God came down to earth to join the human race\nAnd through His kind intention, He came up with a plan\nThat He Himself might be expressed by dispensing into man.", "chorus Oh what a kind intention, oh what abounding grace\nHow our God came down to earth to join the human race\nIt surely was a mystery so deep we could not trace\nThat we might be to the praise of the glory of His grace.", "2 For God had predetermined, by His counsel and His will\nThat man might be a vessel, which He Himself would fill\nAnd so for this He chose us, back in eternity\nAnd He predestinated us His very sons to be.", "3 His task, it was not easy, it surely took much grace\nWhen on the earth He first appeared, a man in time and space\nAnd then for thirty-three long years, He lived out God in Man\nThat He might fully carry out all of the Father's plan.", "4 At the end of His lifetime, He did a wondrous thing\nWent to the cross and shed His blood, redemption to win\nThis brought us into favour, into a blessed place\nFor God forgave our offenses by the riches of His grace.", "5 Now in the application, the Spirit's moving in\nApplying all the Son has done, forgiving all our sin\nHe's sealing God into us, full sonship to bring\nOh, this is the mystery of the universe, and this is why we sing."]
