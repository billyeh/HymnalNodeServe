["chorus If God leads you to walk\nA way that you know,\nIt will not benefit you as much as\nIf He would lead you to take the way\nThat you do not know.\nThis forces you to have\nHundreds and thousands of\nConversations with Him,\nResulting in a journey that is an\nEverlasting memorial\nBetween you and Him."]
