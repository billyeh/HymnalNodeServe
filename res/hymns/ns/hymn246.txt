["1 Though I love You, Lord,\nMy life seems all deformed.\nI give my life to You-\nThen drift away.\nLord, may I ask You that You'd draw me yet again,\nAnd keep me running after You.", "chorus Lord, I've seen Your purpose.\nYour heart's unveiled to me.\nNow I'd just like to see You gain me fully.\nThough You I often limit\nAnd fail by compromise,\nKeep me in the index of Your eyes.", "2 Lord, I want Your best.\nI want Your full blessing.\nI don't want any less,\nThough good it be.\nHave mercy, Lord, to push, to pull, lay hold of me.\nKeep me still running toward the prize.", "3 Mold me, shape me, Lord.\nBe my reality.\nEven break my heart,\nIf it has to be.\nI'm desperate, Lord, that You would have Your way with me.\nOthers could touch You then through me.", "4 Set my heart aflame.\nDon't let me stay the same.\nDon't let things remain\nWhich now grieve You.\nMy life I give to You and all I've claimed as mine.\nMay I just hold, Lord, unto You."]
