["1 Fallen, in her condition\nIsrael left her Love.\nShe was stubborn in her position-\nTo God she would not come.\nUnder the Lord's chastising\nShe was an unturned cake.\nBut Jehovah, with love unchanging\nMakes Israel His own son-a change to make.", "2 You became a man-\nCord of love to me.\nI am drawn with loving bands\nAnd embraced by Thee.\nFrom the heavens came,\nYou stepped out of eternity,\nDied and rose as a man\nThat You could impart Your life to me."]
