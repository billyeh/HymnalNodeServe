["1 Lord, keep me from this evil and perverted age;\nWholly sanctify my eyes-on You to gaze.\nSatisfy my deepest part.\nO Lord, preserve my heart.", "2 Rescue me, Lord, from this dark world-it's just display.\nShine in me, and show me, Lord, You are the way.\nNothing matches me but You.\nOnly Your life will do.", "3 Lord, cause my love for You to grow in me each day.\nThrough this love, show me the world's passing away.\nSeparate me unto You.\nO Lord, my heart renew.", "4 Don't let me go; I'm here for You and this You know.\nDay by day, Your life within me has to grow.\nThough this world is so corrupt,\nI can and do love You.", "5 O Lord, become a river flowing out of me,\nThat the world may take a drink of You and see\nThat You are the only way,\nThe One reality."]
