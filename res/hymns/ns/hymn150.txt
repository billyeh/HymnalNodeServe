["1 Greatly I rejoiced in the Lord,\nBecause your thinking for me\nNow at length anew has blossomed,\nWhich you had indeed taken thought,\nBut lacked opportunity.", "chorus Not by lack so that I speak,\nBut Christ my secret,\nFor I have learned in whatever circumstances\nTo be content.", "2 I know how to be abased,\nAnd I know how to abound,\nTo be filled, to hunger or lack,\nIn all things and in everything\nI've learned the secret.", "3 I am able to do all things\nIn Him who empowers me.\nNevertheless you did well\nTo have fellowship with me\nIn my affliction."]
