["1 Sometimes we're caught in a world full of baits\nTempting us to live our lives contrary to Your aim,\nBut Your faithfulness and love and mercy\nAlways will remain;\nLord, turn us fully back to You again.", "chorus Lord, our whole being we give to You\n'Cause You have bought us with Your blood\nSo we no longer live to ourselves,\nBut everyday our lives we live\nTo You alone, not to our own,\nYour glory, Lord, will then be shown.", "2 Sometimes we lean only on ourselves,\nThinking we can do things without asking for Your help,\nBut Your Spirit in our spirit's\nWorking in and breaking through\nTo free us from the \"self\" and back to You."]
