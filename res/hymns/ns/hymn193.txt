["1 It is God's commandment and it is His desire\nThat His people call, call upon His name.\nIt's the joyful way, the joyful way to drink\nFrom the fountain of God's rich salvation.\nCalling is the way to delight oneself in God;\nThat is to enjoy Him, enjoy the Lord our God.\nHence, we as God's people, must daily call on Him.\nThis must be our practice for God's jubilee."]
