["1 We are the generation\nThe Lord has waited for.\nHe has sought us and pursued us.\nWhen we touched Him, He renewed us.\nNow the time has come\nFor all the young\nTo be in touch with Him!", "2 God loves this generation-\nHe chose us for His plan.\nWe were young and disillusioned\nIn the age of mass confusion.\nNow we are His choice,\nWe all rejoice-\nTo God we say \"Amen.\"", "chorus Once we were searching,\nAlways worrying-\nWhen would we end our search?\nNow we're reborn;\nOur veils are torn,\nSince He brought us into the church!", "3 At last our search has ended;\nOur praises fill the air.\nWe're the chosen generation!\nJesus loves this generation!\nAnd the time has come\nFor all the young\nTo be in love with Him!"]
