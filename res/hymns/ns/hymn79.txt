["1 Praise the Lord, God sent His Son,\nHallelujah!\nAnd salvation's work was done,\nGlory to God!\nGod Himself became a man,\nSo that we might live in Him.", "chorus That's why I call on Him,\nI give my all to Him.", "2 For us He was crucified,\nHallelujah!\nFor the many, one Man died,\nGlory to God!\nOne grain fell into the earth,\nMany grains to bring to birth.", "3 He arose in victory,\nHallelujah!\nFrom the grave, triumphantly,\nGlory to God!\nNow in resurrection He\nAs the Spirit lives in me.", "4 Call on Him from deep within,\nHallelujah!\nJust by calling, He comes in,\nGlory to God!\nOnce you call upon His name,\nNevermore you'll be the same.", "chorus We all must call on Him,\nWe give our all to Him."]
