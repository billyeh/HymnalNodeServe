["1 As we become the same as Christ\nIn life, nature, expression, and function,\nWe are qualified to work with Him\nFor His Body.", "2 As we trust in the Lord helplessly,\nDepend on Him as our love and strength,\nAnd listen to His speaking,\nOur hope is to be raptured\nThrough the redemption of our body.", "chorus And our prayer is-\n\"Come, Lord Jesus!\"\nAnd our prayer is-\n\"Come, Lord Jesus!\"\n\"Come, Lord Jesus!\nLord Jesus, come!\""]
