["1 Until He comes again,\nI'll watch and wait and call on Him\nI'll pray that by His life and power,\nI'll overcome in every hour.", "2 Until He comes again,\nHis blood will cleanse me of my sin\nHis word will sanctify within,\nAnd make me wholly unto Him.", "chorus (Bro.) He died to be life to me-\n From death I'm free.\n(Sis.) He rose and as Spirit He\n Now lives in me.\n(Bro.) In splendor and in glory\n Like Him I'll be.", "3 Until He comes again,\nMy soul-life I'll give up for Him.\nNo worldly pleasure can compare\nTo what my Savior has to share.", "4 And when He comes again,\nAll saints built up and one in Him.\nHis Body, Bride, and Counterpart,\nEternal pleasure of His heart.", "chorus (Sis.) Lord, gain Your kingdom in me,\n I long to be...\n(Bro.) One with my Savior and King,\n Eternally.\n(Sis.) Oh, what a joy it will be\n Your face to see."]
