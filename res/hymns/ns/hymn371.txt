["1 My inner parts have yearned for Him;\nTo my Beloved I now open;\nMy Beloved's gone, He has withdrawn,\nI open but He was gone.", "chorus I am sick with love, I am sick with love for Him.\nIf you find Him, please tell Him that\nI am sick with love for Him.", "2 I sought Him but I found Him not.\nI called Him yet He answered not.\nIf you find my love please tell Him that\nI'm sick with love for Him."]
