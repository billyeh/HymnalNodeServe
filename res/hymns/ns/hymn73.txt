["chorus Trust in Jehovah with all your heart,\nDo not rely on your own understanding.\nIn all your ways acknowledge Him,\nAnd He will make your paths straight.\nO the depth of the riches\nAnd wisdom and knowledge of God!\nHow unsearchable are His judgments\nAnd untraceable His ways!\nBecause out from Him and through Him\nAnd to Him are all things.\nTo Him be the glory forever. Amen."]
