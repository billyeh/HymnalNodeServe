["nonum O Lord, I love You,\nI really love You,\nWithout You life's really nothing.\nYou are so attracting,\nAnd You are so charming;\nYour riches are unsearchable.\nYour name's so dear and sweet,\nCalling makes one satisfied,\nNow You are mine and I am Thine, Lord;\nJoined and mingled with You,\nGod-man incorporation,\nForetaste of the New Jerusalem."]
