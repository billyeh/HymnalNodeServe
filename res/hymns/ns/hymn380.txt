["nonum And to the messenger\nOf the church in Philadelphia write:\nThese things says the Holy One,\nThe true One,\nThe One who has the key of David,\nThe One who opens and no one will shut,\nAnd shuts and no one opens:", "nonum I know your works;\nBehold, I've put before you\nAn opened door\nWhich no one can shut,\nBecause you have a little power\nAnd have kept My word\nAnd have not denied My name."]
