["1 There is now then no condemnation to those\nWho are in Christ Jesus.\nFor the law of the Spirit of life has freed me\nIn Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.", "chorus For the mind set on the flesh is death,\nBut the mind set on the spirit is life.\nSo I will walk in the Spirit today,\nBeing filled with life and peace!", "2 For that which the law could not do, being weak,\nIn the flesh, God sending His Son,\nIn the likeness of flesh, and concerning sin,\nHe condemned sin in the flesh.", "3 That the righteous requirement of the law\nMight be fulfilled in us,\nWho do not walk according to the flesh of sin\nBut who walk according to the spirit.", "4 For those who are according to the flesh,\nThey all mind the things of the flesh;\nBut those who are according to the spirit,\nMind the things of the Spirit."]
