["1 I just keep calling, \"O Lord!\"\nAs I walk along;\nI just keep calling, \"O Lord\"\nAnd He gives a song.\nThough the storm clouds darken the sky,\nO'er the upward trail;\nI just keep calling, \"O Lord\";\nHe will never fail.\nHe's a faithful friend,\nSuch a faithful friend;\nI can count on Him\nTo the very end.\nThough the storm clouds darken the sky,\nO'er the upward trail;\nI just keep calling, \"O Lord\"\nHe will never fail."]
