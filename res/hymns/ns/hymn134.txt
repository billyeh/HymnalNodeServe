["1 Prod me with Your loving hands,\nStir me from my deep impasse.\nI long to flee this stagnant rut;\nMy soul, my prison, deadened lot,\nWhich end is just to taste Your wrath;\nSo set me on the narrow path.\nThorns and thistles may line this road\nBut it leads me to the mutual abode.\n\nLift me up with Your mighty hand\nAbove this frenzied earthly land.\nSet me on the mount to see\nWhat the world can offer me;\nTill I see the vanity from on high\nAnd earthly desires I bid goodbye\nAnd set my eyes on You."]
