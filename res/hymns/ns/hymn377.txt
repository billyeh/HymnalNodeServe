["nonum Being diligent to keep the oneness\nOf the Spirit\nIn the uniting bond of peace:", "nonum One Body and one Spirit,\nEven as also you were called\nIn one hope, in one hope of your calling;", "nonum One Lord, one faith, one baptism;\nOne God and Father of all,\nWho is over all and through all and in all."]
