["1 There's a gospel of today\nThat says believe and you'll be saved and then\nYou can go to heaven and see the pearly gates\nAnd walk the golden streets;\nWords like these fail to treat\nAll the vanity that is hidden in me.", "2 But the gospel is to me\nThe Triune God within humanity\nAs the Spirit reaching me to be in me\nThe one reality;\nLove untold-Gospel theme\nNever getting old-story told eternally.", "3 Left the ninety-nine behind-\nYou searched until the lost sheep You did find,\nLaid me on Your shoulders there, You bore me in\nYour tender loving care;\nRejoicing-You found me\nThough a small lost sheep-You gave all to come find me.", "4 Sweeping in my deepest parts,\nYou lit a lamp and searched my inward heart,\nSanctifying deep within You shined in me,\nExposed me of my sin;\nRepenting-now I see\nLord, You're sprinkling me-with the blood You shed for me.", "5 Eagerly awaiting me\nThat I the slightest turn to Thee would make\nThough my life had been a wreck, You ran to me\nAnd fell upon my neck\nKissing me, affectionately;\nKilled the calf for me-\"Let us eat and be merry.\""]
