["1 In the church life we can see\nWe are God's own family.\nAs we blend with the saints\nWe are built up in love,\nHis expression thus to be.", "chorus In the church we are home;\nHere our joy has begun.\nIn this sweet fellowship\nWe are built up in love\nAs the many, yet as one.", "2 In each member we can see\nOur God in humanity;\nAs each functions in life,\nChrist is then manifest\nThrough His Body practic'ly.", "3 As we gather we can see\nOne expression, corp'rately;\nAs His Body on earth,\nNow Christ's riches we share\nIn the church life, heavenly!"]
