["1 From the morning to the evening, His faithfulness I see;\nHis mercy reaching sinners, reaching even me;\nAnd I know, now I know.\nBrighter than the brightest sunlight, all doubts and fears must cease;\nSweeter than the sweetest delight, His living Word in me;\nAnd I know, now I know.", "chorus That God is there for me tomorrow,\nAs He is for me today;\nThat He'll take my cares and sorrow,\nAnd He'll wipe them all away;\nThere's no crisis that He can't bear,\nThere's no storm He can't abate;\nHe's my God, He's my God.", "2 Day by day His grace grows dearer; His love has conquered me,\nNever leaving, never ceasing, His Spirit constantly\nFlooding me, rich and free;\nHigher than the highest heaven, He lifts me up to see\nNew Jerusalem descending, His Bride, His love to be\nEternally, it shall be."]
