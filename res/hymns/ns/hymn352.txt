["1 Don't you want to know your God?\nWhat's hidden in His heart for you?\nHow much He longs for you to come \nAnd open up-\nTo let Him in to every part\nLet Him reveal what's on His heart\nWhat was the joy set before Him?", "chorus It was for her the church-His bride\nIt was for her, willingly He died\nShe is the joy deep in His heart \nHis masterpiece-\nHis counterpart.", "2 The Lord chose you to be a part\nOf His great plan, His work of art.\nWhat wonder! What a privilege!\nTo satisfy\nHis yearning to share all He is-\nDivine, unsearchable riches! \nWhat wisdom, multifarious expressed?", "3 As we enjoy and enter in\nTo all He is then we'll begin\nTo understand the feeling in\nHis heart toward us.\nWhat love that motivated Him!\nTo come to us, despite our sin \nWhy did He go and sell all that He had?"]
