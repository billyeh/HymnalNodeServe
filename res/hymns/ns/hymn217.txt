["1 There's a life that's deeper than our mind,\nWith experience of man, yet so divine.\nIt's a life that knows no bounds;\nAnd with glory is crowned;\nIt's of depth and height and breadth unsearchable.\nNow this life is just the Living One\nManifested in the Person of the Son.\nAs the Spirit, He flows;\nIn our spirit He grows,\nGrowing up to be the church that He desires.", "chorus O Lord, we're just for Your flowing;\nHow we need a deeper knowing!\nLife is why we're here\nAnd why You've come in us.\nTurn us, Lord, turn us now;\nTurn us deeply-Life is how\nYou will get the church,\nThe home You're longing for.", "2 In the church, we all can apprehend\nAll the riches of this life that is within.\nNot just shallowness with strife,\nBut a deep and peaceful life\nIs just waiting to flow out, a living spring.\nWith the saints it's easy to be bold,\nTo pursue this life, to gain it, to lay hold.\nAll the other things we find,\nMust be quickly left behind,\nSo that only life remains for us to see.", "3 Deeper, Lord our turn must be to You;\nWe would move by life in everything we do;\nAll our concepts refute,\nFor Your life be absolute-\nGrant us grace to turn much deeper day by day.\nWhen we touch our spirit-such a thrill!\nThis is far beyond emotion, mind, and will-\nIt's within our hidden part-\nCome, make home in all our heart;\nLet Your presence flow as rivers deep within."]
