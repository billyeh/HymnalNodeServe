["1 The gift of righteousness is measured in abundance,\nThe depth of His love I'll never understand.\nHis love reaches me and you;\nHis mercy goes farther too.\nThe One on the throne of God is called the Lamb.", "chorus So, why not open up and call His name, \"Oh Lord!\"\nFind your spirit where His grace has been outpoured.\nCall His name, taste His grace, exercise before His face\nHe's longing and yearning.\nHe's hoping and waiting.\nHe's ever desiring for you...\nTo turn to Him.", "2 He knows your deepest thought,\n Your every situation.\nHe understands your heart,\nHe knows your history.\nThere's nothing in His way,\nHe's just waiting for you to say\n\"Lord Jesus, my wandering heart\n I give to Thee.\""]
