["1 The law of the Lord is perfect,\nConverting the soul;\nThe testimony of the Lord is sure,\nMaking wise the simple.", "chorus More to be desired are they than gold.\nYea, than much fine gold:\nSweeter also than honey\nAnd the honeycomb.", "2 The statues of the Lord are right,\nRejoicing the heart:\nThe commandment of the Lord is pure,\nEnlightening the eyes.", "3 The fear of the Lord is clean,\nEnduring forever;\nThe judgments of the Lord are true\nAnd righteous altogether.", "4 Let the words of my mouth\nAnd the meditation of my heart,\nBe acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord,\nMy strength, and my redeemer.", "chorus Moreover by them is Thy servant warned:\nIs Thy servant warned:\nAnd in keeping of them there is\nGreat reward."]
