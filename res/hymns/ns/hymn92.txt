["1 We'd experience Christ daily,\nHim we would constantly pursue.\nOur pursuing has a purpose\nTo build His Body is our view.", "chorus Occupy us for Your Body.\nGrace supplying, You afford.\nAlways bearing, always caring,\nBy Your grace we'd be outpoured.", "2 Grant us, Lord, a willing spirit.\nTo build Your Body we would strive.\nBy our measure we would function,\nUntil full grown we'd all arrive.", "3 As the members of His Body,\nEach one is now a life supply.\nServing Christ to one another,\nIn love, His Body built thereby."]
