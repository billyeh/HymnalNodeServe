["1 Recall how David swore,\n\"I'll not come into my house,\nNor go up to my bed,\nGive slumber to mine eyelids,\nUntil I find a place for Thee,\nA place, O Lord, for Thee.\"\nOur mighty God desires a home\nWhere all His own may come.", "2 How blinded we have been:\n\"We'll build Your habitation\"\nWhen we are short of Christ-\nWe need Your saturation!\nO Lord, You care for our house!\nOh, what a blessed word!\nAs You're to God, You'd be to us-\nA mutual abode.", "3 There's nothing that we are\nOr have or do well-pleasing;\nWe need Thee, glorious Christ,\nInwrought into our being.\nO Lord, our heart's still vacant now!\nCome in and settle down.\nCome saturate and permeate\nAnd fill us with Yourself.", "4 Our spirit You have filled\nAt our regeneration,\nBut mind, emotion, will\nAwait Your saturation.\nHow much of You is built in us\nTo make our heart Your home?\nO Triune God, we welcome You.\nCome build, oh, build in us.", "5 Into our innermost\nIntrinsic constitution,\nCome, Lord, Yourself dispense\nBy constant, fresh infusion;\nTransform us, Lord, and work Yourself,\nAs God's embodiment,\nInto our heart, and life each part,\nWith Your reality.", "6 To build Your house today,\nSelf-effort You're refusing-\nAll stubble, wood, and hay;\nGold, silver, gems, You're using.\nThe consummated Triune God\nTransmitted into us\nNow builds Himself into a home-\nHis dwelling, glorious.\n(Repeat the last four lines)"]
