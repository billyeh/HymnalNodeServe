["chorus I'm walking down the road\nThat leads to glory.\nI'm pressing toward the mark\nBy enjoying God!\nI don't know so much,\nJust to love Him.\nI'm walking down the road,\nGlory, here I come.", "1 With the brothers and the sisters,\nWe enjoy Him day by day.\nIt's so simple and easy,\nOur worries flee away.\nNow we're growing together,\nAs one big family,\nAbiding in the joy of the Lord.", "2 We enjoy You, Lord Jesus,\nIn our experience.\nWe're getting to know You-\nIt's making us leap and dance.\nJust eating and drinking,\nIt's what we do the best,\nDelighting in the love of the Lord.", "3 We're walking, not running,\nCause we're in the pasture land.\nOur Shepherd is nearby,\nWe're trusting in His hand.\nHe's everything to us,\nHe's all we ever need,\nResting in the peace of the Lord."]
