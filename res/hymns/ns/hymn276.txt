["1 Rise up, my love, my beautiful one,\nAnd come away, for behold, the winter is past,\nThe rain is over and gone.\nFlow'rs appear on the earth,\nThe time of singing has come,\nAnd the voice of the turtle dove\nIs heard in our land.\nMy beloved is mine,\nAnd I am His,\nHe who feeds His flocks among the lilies.\n'Til the day breaks,\nAnd the shadows flee away,\nCome my beloved,\nCome my beloved!\nRise up, my love, my beautiful one\nAnd come away, for behold, the winter is past,\nThe rain is over and gone."]
