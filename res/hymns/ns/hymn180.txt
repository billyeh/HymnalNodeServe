["1 God's eternal economy\nIs to make man the same as He is\nIn life and nature,\nBut not in the Godhead\nAnd to make Himself one with man\nAnd man one with Him\nThus to be enlarged and expanded in His expression\nThat all His divine, that all His divine\nAttributes may be expressed in human virtues."]
