["1 I want to tell You, Lord, how much You mean to me.\nThrough years of careful molding, Your plan at last I see.\nThough pain I've had and suffering too,\nMyself I yield at last, Lord, to You.", "2 I want to care for You, the way You've cared for me.\nYou've been my friend to comfort, received me when I've strayed.\nAnd in return I offer You\nMy life so small compared, Lord, to You.", "3 I'd like for You to fill me with all that You are.\nAnd empty out my heart from everything You're not.\nYou've blessed me Lord by finding me.\nPossess me now eternally."]
