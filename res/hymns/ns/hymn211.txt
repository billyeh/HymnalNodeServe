["1 Jesus Lord, truly I love Thee;\nMy heart refine!\nI'd redeem each precious moment,\nTo enjoy Thy love divine.\nLord, behold, all to Thee I yield,\nConstrained this day\nBy compassions never failing,\nThy perfecting care,\nDear Lord, open mine ear,\nAt the doorpost of God's house,\nResponding to Thy voice,\nI would be Thine and Thine forever,\nSet me a seal on Thine heart,\nWith Thy love, even Thy jealousy,\nLet me be Thy crazy lover \nThrough all my days.", "2 God of glory, we bow the knee,\nGrant us today\nSpir't of wisdom, revelation,\nThe mystery to see,\nI'd outpour all my life for Thine economy,\nJust for Thine eternal pleasure,\nThe Body of Christ,\nIn my mingled spirit lead me\nTo the Body's reality,\nIn Thine intensification\nMake us the testimony of Jesus\nO Lord! For this we yearn!\nQuickly come, as once Thou promised!\nLord, our deepest longing\nIs Thy return!"]
