["1 Lord, You have searched me and You have known me.\nYou understand my thoughts from afar!\nYou comprehend my path and are acquainted with all my ways,\nFor there is not a word on my tongue,\nBut behold You know it all together!", "chorus Search me, O God, and know my heart;\nTry me and know my anxieties;\nSee if there is any wicked in me,\nAnd lead me in the way everlasting!", "2 Lord, You have touched me and You have shown me\nThat I am not so simple as I thought.\nI often run and hide, prone to an errant heart.\nBut there is not a pause and You pursue!\nAnd behold You've caught me altogether!", "chorus Where can I go from Your Spirit, O Lord?\nI can't flee from Your presence, You're inside me.\nI've climbed the steep mountains, but You still are there,\nDescend to the valleys but You find me.", "3 Now I see, there's something more to this pattern:\nYou want to show me all that You are.\nSo You've drawn me from this strife, into the family life.\nAs one, our prayers can match Your deep desires.\nNow behold we follow You together!"]
