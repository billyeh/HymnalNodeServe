["1 Your love and beauty has drawn me;\nTo run after You lovingly.\nIn Your chambers I am brought,\nNourished by You, dear Lord.", "chorus My Beloved, I belong to You.\nMy love, you're so beautiful.\nWe're the same in life and in nature,\nUnited in love forever.", "2 I partake of Your nature divine,\nI enjoy Your divine life to shine.\nRenewed in submission sweet,\nRise up with You to meet.", "3 Viewing You like a dove uniquely,\nTrusting You singly as a lily.\nTransformed and built up to be\nYour rest and joy wholly.", "4 Let us go to the fields, my Beloved,\nWorking here with You, Lord, in love.\nYour queen longs to be matured,\nAnd hopes to be raptured.", "chorus Set me as a seal on Your heart,\nIn Your love, keep me-ne'er apart.\nLord, make haste, I long for Your coming,\nCome quickly, Beloved, we're waiting!"]
