["nonum For we do not have a High Priest who cannot\nBe touched with the feeling of our weaknesses,\nBut One who has been tempted in all respects like us,\nYet without sin, yet without sin.", "nonum Let us therefore come forward\nWith boldness to the throne of grace\nThat we may receive mercy and find grace\nFor timely help."]
