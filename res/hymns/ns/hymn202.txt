["1 Lord, I love You, Lord, I need You,\nYou're the One, the One I need,\nTo live this life, Lord, I need You always;\nBy Your presence, Lord, take lead.\nLord, look into me,\nAnd infuse me\nTo walk by the strength of Your eyes.\nLord embrace me,\nBear me in You,\nDeep in Your love I hide.\nAnd when I'm weak, Lord, and can't go on more,\nLift my eyes to gaze on You;\nSpeak softly to me, Come in, subdue me;\nIn Your strength, Lord, take me through."]
