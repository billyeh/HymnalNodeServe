["1 Once again a new beginning,\nYesterday I've put behind,\nTo You Lord I come in seeking,\nFor Your Words, bring them to mind.\nOh Lord, grant me Your rich speaking,\nCause my spirit filled to be,\nLord, my heart and thoughts transforming,\nThat my life I live by Thee.", "2 Lord, today I give unto Thee,\nSaturate me, capture me,\nShine upon me, burn within me,\nPurge my darkness, sin in me.\nFree from every fetter, burden,\nJoy in choosing all Your ways,\nKeeping to the path You've trodden,\nI'll submit to You always."]
