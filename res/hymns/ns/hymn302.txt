["chorus Draw me, dear Lord.\nDraw me today.\nFrom everything else, dear Lord,\nDraw me away.", "1 O Lord, this whole world\nSeems to weigh me down.\nAll the cares, the strife the sin,\nWithin me and all around.", "2 But, Lord, I want to set my heart,\nAnd, Lord, I want to stay with You.\n'Cause only when You're near to me\nIs everything okay.", "3 And though everything may fall apart\nOr everything go my way,\nIt doesn't really matter, Lord,\nAs long as I gain You today."]
