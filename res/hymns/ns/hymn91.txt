["1 Make me a hungry seeker,\nYour filling to receive.\nMake mine a longing soul, Lord,\nYour goodness satisfy me.\nIf I'm not hungry empty within,\nYour blessing will pass me by.\nMake me a hungry seeker, Lord,\nI want Your rich supply.", "2 My eyes be set on You, Lord;\nEach pleasure and each pain\nWould make me look at You, Lord,\nGod's riches and grace to gain.\nIf I am full and think I'm rich,\nEmpty, You'll send me away;\nContinually I'm hungry, Lord.\nMy heart on You will stay."]
