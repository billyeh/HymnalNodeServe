["1 Each time in the morning, a while before dawn\nTo You, Lord, I whisper a praise or a song,\nAnd feel Your life stirring so deep within me-\nMy cup runneth over with joy!", "2 And then at the moment my heart turns to Thee,\nThe eyes of my spirit Your presence can see;\nWhile all is so fresh and the sunlight breaks through-\nMy cup runneth over with joy!", "3 And when at the noontime I'm hungry and worn\nAnd feel that the cares of this world have me torn,\nYou come as my haven, my rest, and my food-\nMy cup runneth over with joy!", "4 And then in the evening when my thoughts are free,\nRemembr'ing that You, Lord, still dwell within me,\nThis sweet fact releases a river in me-\nMy cup runneth over with joy!"]
