["1 Thy word is sweet unto my taste,\nYea, sweeter more than honey.\nIt says to watch and pray that you\nMay not enter into temptation.\n\nBut flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness,\nfaith, love, and peace.\nWhatever you do,\ndo in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nAnd pursue with those,\nThose who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."]
