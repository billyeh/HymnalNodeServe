["1 Lord, You love me so immensely;\nI would love You more intensely.\nEvery day and every moment,\nO Lord, capture me.\nLet my goal and my life's theme be,\nLord, to love You more supremely;\nWith all my heart, Lord Jesus,\nKeep me faithful unto Thee.", "chorus Draw me, Lord, each day.\nTake my veils away.\nWith a pure heart will I see You;\nLord I just love You.\nNothing else I seek;\nNo one else for me.\nI would fully and absolutely\nGive my whole being unto Thee."]
