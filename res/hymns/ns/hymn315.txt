["1 In this godless age\nLord, You need some Samuels\nBurdened with a vision clear of Your economy\nWhere's Your ark today?\nAnd the ones who'd care for You,\nE'en to put themselves aside to gain Your heart's desire?", "chorus Raise up some to meet Your need, some Nazarites,\nProphets, priests, and judges, and men of prayer,\nSpeaking forth Your word, with Your authority,\nA photo of Your heart for Your move.", "2 Train us up today,\nFull of vision, seeking You,\nWe'd await Your timing, fully subject to Your will,\nTreasuring Your face,\nStaying in Your presence, Lord;\nE'en the very index of Your eye would we obey.", "chorus Raise up some to meet Your need, some Nazarites,\nTo bring in Your kingdom on earth today,\nTaking You as King that You might return\nTo usher in the end of the age.", "3 When God wants to move,\nHe must gain an instrument;\nOvercomers separated from the current age.\nThey have joined themselves\nThrough His word to His desire.\nOvercomers constituted with the Holy Word.", "chorus Raise up some to meet Your need, some Nazarites,\nVoluntary consecrated ones,\nWho through Your word are joined to Your desire;\nYour living testimony on the earth.", "4 God needs men who pray;\nThose who lay the tracks for Him;\nGod's economy is carried out through men of prayer.\nThey love not themselves;\nBut a willing sacrifice.\nWhat they fear-offending God, losing His presence dear.", "chorus Make us those who meet Your need, the Nazarites.\nMake us those through whom You'd close this age;\nWho are one with You to bring the kingdom in,\nYoung people absolute for Your move."]
