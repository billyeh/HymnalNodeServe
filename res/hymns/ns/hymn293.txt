["chorus Did you know that I'm a God-man?\nA three-part man mingled with the Triune God,\nAnd I have a spirit\nWhere the enemy has no way, no hope, no ground...\nI am a God-man!\n[I am a God-man] (spoken)", "1 The Lord lives inside of Me,\nAnd He's using my spirit as a beachhead\nTo spread Himself into every part\nOf my mind, emotion, and will.\nHe sowed Himself as the seed\nInto my innermost part-\nAnd the kingdom is here,\nToday, now, inside of me\nAnd my heart is now His home!", "2 Every time I say \"Amen\" to His Spirit\nAnd walk by my spirit,\nThe kingdom seed grows and develops\nDeep inside of me.\nOn the outside, it may seem that there's\nNo change in me-\nBut I'm not the same,\n'Cause as the seed grows in me,\nInside I'm becoming God!"]
