["1 Dearest Lord, You've called us here,\nAnd opened up Your heart.\nO the joy to hear Your call\nAnd enter in the Ark.\nSaving us from day to day\nO Lord, this is Your way.\nIn Yourself we stay afloat,\nAbove this wicked age today.", "chorus Thank You Lord, in Your eyes we find grace,\nAnd with open hearts we come to You.\nRegardless what our friends might say to us or do,\nO Lord Jesus, we love You.", "2 Seeking of this age to taste,\nAnd of it have a part.\nIf we only knew, dear Lord,\nThe ways we grieve Your heart.\nWe would come and turn to You\nWith a repenting heart,\nAnd would give ourselves to be\nWith you, O Lord, inside the Ark.", "3 Praise You Lord, we're safe in You;\nOutside death-waters pour.\nMany things that I once loved\nAre on the ocean floor.\nKeep us open to You Lord,\nDon't let us miss the mark.\nHallelujah, praise the Lord,\nWe're here within the church, the Ark."]
