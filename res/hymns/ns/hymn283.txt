["chorus I am crucified with Christ\nAnd it is no longer I who liveth,\nBut it is Christ who lives in me;\nAnd the life which I now live\nIn the flesh, I live in faith-\nThe faith in the Son of God\nWho loved and gave Himself up for me.", "1 And now I'm walking by the Spirit\nStep by step, day by day,\nO Lord, I love You.\nYou're the precious One to me.\nAs I do this and that\nLord, remind me where You're at;\nYou're in my spirit,\nDispensing grace to me.", "2 And now I'm walking by the Spirit,\nMarching on toward the goal.\nO Lord, Your purpose\nMeans everything to me.\nAll self-love I lay aside\nFor the churches, for Your Bride,\nFor the fulfillment\nOf Your economy."]
