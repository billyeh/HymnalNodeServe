["1 I'm gonna praise God unceasingly\nBecause He lives in me,\nHe's everything to me,\nGives life continually.\nI'm gonna praise God unceasingly\nBecause He lives in me,\nAnd He will never leave.", "chorus Now in our spirit we can feed,\nJesus Christ is all we need,\nCall His name and He becomes reality.\nOpen up your mouth and you will see,\nJust how rich our Lord can be.\nHe's the very life supply, complete is He.", "2 Now I live by the tree of life,\nHis fruit does nourish me,\nO, how it strengthens me,\nI'll live eternally.\nNow I live by the tree of life,\nHim daily I apply,\nHe is my food supply.", "3 There's a river of life in me,\nFlowing so livingly,\nMoving continually,\nHe just keeps flooding me.\nThere's a river of life in me,\nHe's always filling me,\nHis name is Jesus Christ!"]
