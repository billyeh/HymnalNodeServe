["1 I'm pressing on the God-man way,\nNew Christ I'm gaining every day,\nStill groaning through this world of strife\nI want to live a God-man life!", "chorus Lord grow in me! You are the seed,\nOf God-man life; You're all I need.\nIn all my heart, I give You ground.\nLord, may Your life in me abound!", "2 My heart has no desire to stay,\nOn hardened ground, in the world's way.\nSatan no more shall steal Your Word,\nI'll move my heart where You are heard!", "3 I want to deal with rocks in me,\nFrom hidden sins, I would be free.\nMy heart I would clear up through prayer,\nI'll gain more depth to root You there!", "4 The choking thorns, us barren make,\nThe life seed soon they'll overtake.\nRiches, anxiety reject,\nJust for God's growth the ground protect!", "5 The sun must shine for us to grow,\nSo persecution we will know.\nWhen it seems more than we can bear,\nLord, help us drink You deeply there!", "6 We want to grow to utmost height,\nUntil Your Body comes in sight.\nYourself in man will then be shown;\nYour plan at last by all be known!"]
