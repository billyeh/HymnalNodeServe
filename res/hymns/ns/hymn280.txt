["1 Lord, make me to know mine end,\nAnd the measure of my days, what it is,\nThat I may know how frail I am,\nHow frail I am.", "2 Behold, Thou hast made my days as an handbreadth;\nAnd mine age is as nothing before Thee;\nVerily every man at his best state,\nIs altogether vanity. Selah.", "3 Surely every man walketh in a vain show;\nSurely they are disquieted in vain;\nHe heapeth up riches, and knoweth not\nWho shall gather them.", "4 And now, Lord, what wait I for?\nMy hope is in Thee.\nNow Lord, what wait I for?\nMy hope is in Thee.\nMy hope is in Thee.\n(repeat stanzas 3 and 4)"]
