["1 Lord Jesus, You're lovely.\nYou're more to be desired,\nThan any earthly pleasure.\nYou're fine, beyond compare.\nLord Jesus, Your beauty\nDoes far exceed all others.\nYou're comely and You're tender.\nYou're radiant and You're fair.", "2 When I behold You Jesus,\nYou draw my heart completely.\nI cannot turn away Lord,\nI rest in Your embrace;\nAnd time is gone there's only\nYour holy, matchless presence\nAbiding in You, gazing\nUpon Your glorious face.", "3 I give my life to You Lord,\nFor You alone are worthy.\nThere's nothing and there's no one\nThat I desire but You.\nMay all my days be Yours, Lord,\nMy heart be given to love You,\nTo treasure and to serve You\nBy Your sufficient grace."]
