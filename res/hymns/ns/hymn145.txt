["1 In my spirit, I can see You as You are.\nYou're the Alpha, Omega, the Bright and Morning Star.\nHere You'll stay, just as a flow within\nTo occupy my heart and spread Your life within,\nIn my spirit! You're all in all to me.", "chorus In my spirit is the key,\nNo longer need I worry right or wrong;\nIn the church, reality-\nRooted, grounded in Your plan\n where I belong.", "2 In my spirit, I can see You in the church;\nIt's Your heart's desire, for it a people You will search.\nHere I'll stay, within Your perfect will,\nBuilt up into a home, Your glory here to fill.\nIn the church! I must no longer roam.", "3 In Your purpose, we just flow along in life.\nIt's so simple, no more unrest and strife.\nIn the churches, we just enjoy You, Lord.\nHere You can build us up, for we're in one accord;\nIn the churches-we know You'll be back soon.", "note (Repeat chorus and second verse)"]
