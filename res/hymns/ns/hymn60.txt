["1 O there's One in me who\nIs the most lovely One\nIn the whole universe-\nI just love Him.", "2 He has made me fall in love\nWith Him more and more each day:\nAnd for now that I'm in love-\nI'll always stay.", "chorus For my Jesus has captured my heart.\nHe has wrecked me with all He can impart.\nHe drew me to Himself,\nNow I love nothing else.\nHis beauty, love and charm won my heart.", "3 As the days go on and on\nThere's a hold that is so strong.\nA tide floods all my being-\nFor I'm in love.", "4 There's a face I long to see\nWhose arms will embrace me.\nAs I rest in this sweet place\nI love Him more and more."]
