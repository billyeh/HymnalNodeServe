["1 Lord, I have the life; but Lord, You know\nThat I need the lights of the fourth day.\nI have the light from the first day already,\nBut I need the lights of the fourth day.\nLord Jesus, I need You as the Sun.\nI need to contact You directly.\nI want to be in Your presence\nDay by day, I want to be under Your shining.\nI also need the church, the moon,\nAnd I need the stars;\nI need the overcoming saints,\nThe ones who are shining, who turn many to righteousness,\nI need those who can turn people\nFrom darkness to light!"]
