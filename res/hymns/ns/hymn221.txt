["1 More of our heart, dear Lord, we'd give You now;\nEven more ground to You, Lord, we'd allow.\nAll that distracts us we'd despise,\nAll that draws away our eyes-\nLord, do fill our vision\n'Til the morning star has risen!\nWe would count all things loss, but Jesus gain;\nOur inward parts cry out for You to reign.\nWorthy You are our heart to claim-\nCome, engrave on us Your name,\nWe would love You, Jesus, more.", "2 Less we would argue, Lord, and go our way;\nMore we would say \"Amen\" to what You say.\nGrant us a walk to You conformed,\n'Til our living is transformed.\nWe adore You, Jesus-\nMay a pure love for You seize us.\nAny unwillingness, Lord, quickly slay;\nEven by faith we open all the way-\nRising to heights of love unknown,\nChrist our destiny alone,\nWe would love You, Jesus, more!"]
