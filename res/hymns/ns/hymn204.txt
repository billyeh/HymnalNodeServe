["1 When all around my sky is falling\nAnd fear and doubt run deep in my heart,\nIt's in these times I'm on You calling,\nOpening to You, Lord, my deepest part.", "chorus Oh, Lord Jesus!\nHow I love You!\nAnd I need You\nAll the time.\nAhh, to touch You\nIn my weakness,\nAnd to hold You,\nSavior mine.", "2 Lord, by Your mercy You consume me.\nIt's all according to God's plan.\nBy resurrection life renew me,\nDay by day, my inner man."]
