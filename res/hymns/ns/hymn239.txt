["chorus Lord, take my life\nI give it, Lord, to You.\nYou have opened my eyes, Lord,\nAnd turned me to You.\nYou are my Creator, O Lord,\nHow I love You.\nYou are also my Savior\nAnd everything that's true.", "1 Lord, so often I'm like Thomas\nWho would not receive:\n\"Unless I see Your face, Lord, I would not believe...\"\nBut then You would appear...\n\"My Lord and my God\"\nSaying, Blessed are they who see not, yet believe.", "2 I have someone deep within me\nWelling up in me each day.\nEven though I have not seen Him in such an outward way-\n\"Whom having not seen, I love,\nI love, oh so much.\nAnd by having His life, yes, I believe.\"\n(Chorus)", "3 Day by day I look forward to\nThat time I spend with You.\nJust as Mary poured her love out,\nO Lord, I would too.\nGrant me, Lord, a heart\nthat's single and true.\nAnd a daily life that's living just by You.", "4 So when daily I see trials\nAnd tribulations sore,\nMay I put my trust in You, Lord,\n\"For Christ has gone before\"\nAnd open to Your living Word,\nReceiving faith-\nReach me, Lord, with Your mercy and Your grace.\n(Chorus)"]
