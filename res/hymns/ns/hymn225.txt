["1 Praise the Lord! The God of glory\nWho appeared to Abraham\nHas appeared to us in spirit\nFor His purpose and His plan!\nGod of glory, God of glory,\nDo appear to us today,\nSaturate and permeate us\nTill You fully have Your way.", "2 Once we were in old Chaldea,\nWorshipping the idols there;\nBut the God of glory called us,\nSaved us all from Satan's snare.\nGet out, get out, from Chaldea,\nFrom that evil foreign land.\nCome in, come in, to the good land,\nChrist, the church, the one new man.", "3 With the calling comes the promise\nOf the kingdom life on earth.\nThis becomes our strength and motive\nTo get out of all the dearth!\nLord, we're crossing every river-\nFor this You must call us on,\nTill Your kingdom and expression\nOn this earth are fully come.", "4 This is now the highest gospel\nTo those still in Chaldee's land-\nLeave the fallen situation,\nYou've been chosen for God's plan.\nGod of glory, God of glory,\nDo appear to us each day,\nCall us out into Your building,\nYour desire on earth today."]
