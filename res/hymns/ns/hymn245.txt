["1 How glorious is Thy church, Oh Lord-\nNo trace of sin in her.\nWhat myst'ry this: \"God died as man,\nFor, oh, He loves her so!", "chorus Glorious, Glorious church,\nShe is Thy dear Bride;\nShe was built from Thine own side;\nShe is the same as Thee.", "2 How precious is Thy Body, Lord;\nHow costly in Thy sight.\nI'd ne'er bring anything of self,\nFor she is out from Thee.", "3 How faithful is Thyself, dear Lord-\nEternally the same.\nThough man may fail to reach Thy will,\nThou shalt obtain Thy Bride.", "4 How subtle is my self, Oh Lord;\nYet I wilt be transformed.\nThrough Spirit's work-become a stone\nTo build up Thine own Bride.", "5 How precious is Thy Body, Lord;\nHow costly in my sight.\nI would decrease, and Thee increase\nAt any cost for her."]
