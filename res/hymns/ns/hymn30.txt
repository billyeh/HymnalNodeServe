["1 Take time to receive Him-the blessing's outpoured,\nAnd we may obtain it by reading His Word;\nWe bask in the splendour of His healing light,\nAnd light becomes life, as in Him we delight.", "2 Take time to absorb Him, to gain the supply,\nThat we may be watered and nourished thereby;\nThe deeper the roots spread, the deeper the flow,\nAnd richer and higher within us He'll grow.", "3 Take time to inhale Him-His Word we may breathe;\nBy breathing it, God's very life we receive-\nHe breathes Himself out so that we may breathe in\nThe life, the reality, fullness of Him.", "4 Take time to enjoy Him, our portion is He:\nOur present, available reality;\nOur practical, real, and enjoyable Lord\nIs everything to us through His living Word.", "5 Take time to behold Him, gaze oft on His face,\nReceiving His Person, and grace upon grace.\nBy His pleasant shining, infused we will be;\nOur faces will glow with His light, radiantly."]
