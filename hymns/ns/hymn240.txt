["1 Lord, I give myself to You again today\nLord, on this consecration path I choose to stay\nYou bought me with a price\nMy life I sacrifice\nLord, I am not my own.", "2 Lord, I give myself to You again today\nYour mercy reached me though I was so far away\nYou gave Yourself for me\nFrom whose earthly dreams You freed\nLord, I am Yours alone.", "3 Lord, I give myself to You again today\nI open to You so that You may have a way\nTo work in me that I\nMight serve You my whole life\nLord, I love You alone."]
