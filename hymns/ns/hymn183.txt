["1 Christ is a genuine man,\nThe perfect and finest man,\nObedient, serving, no appearance of evil,\nThe finest personality,\nDivinity expressed through humanity.", "2 Christ is the pattern for our human living.\nHis perfect life is filling us.\nChrist is the pattern for our human living,\nThe fine and balanced humanity of Jesus!\n(Repeat 1st stanza)"]
