["1 There is a song within me;\nIt's a song of Jesus moving\nIn the gardens of my heart.\nThis Jesus lives within me,\nPlanting flowers of Himself\nThere to be watered by my Love.", "chorus I'm loving Jesus, this lovely Person\nWith personality so strong.\nHe brought me to Himself\nAnd said to me, \"All of your heart's desire\nis found in Me;\nI'm all you need and I love you.\"", "2 There is a peace within me\nThat has sprung from deep contentment\nWith my Lord, who's All in All.\nFor my delight is in this\nLiving One inside of me\nWho is Himself, my everything."]
