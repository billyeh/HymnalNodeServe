["1 Oh, who's like our Jesus? He's all we desire!\nHis love draws us near-sets our spirits afire!\nWe cannot but love Him-As one we proclaim:\n\"Lord Jesus, we love Thee-exalt Thy dear name!\"", "2 O Jesus, our Jesus, with Thee we are blest-\nOur Life, our Enjoyment, our Peace and our Rest:\nThy name be our theme, and Thy love be our song;\nThy love has inspired both our heart and our tongue!", "3 O Jesus, our Jesus, how can we express\nThy dearness, so precious, and Thy loveliness?\nWhen we see Thy beauty, all else fades away-\nAll shadows must flee at the breaking of day!", "4 We love Thee, we love Thee, we love Thee, O Lord.\nWe love Thee, our Jesus, we love Thee, our God!\nWe love Thee, we love Thee, and that Thou dost know;\nAs we're in Thy presence, love for Thee will grow!"]
