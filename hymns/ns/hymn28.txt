["1 God has called us for His purpose,\nHis economy so glorious,\nFor which He was fully processed;\nConsummated now is He!\nAs the Spirit, He indwells us;\nAs our God alloted portion,\nWorking out His full salvation,\nMaking us the same as He is.", "chorus Oh, may a clear, controlling vision of\nThe Lord's economy direct my heart,\nAnd burn in me until my spirit's wholly set afire!\nWith spirit strong and active we'll press on\nTo consummate God's goal-\nNew Jerusalem, Hallelujah!", "2 Jesus lived the God-man pattern,\nSet the way for us to follow,\nHe denied His natural man and \nWas obedient unto death,\nOnce He was the only God-man;\nNow we are His duplication.\nAs the many grains we're blended\nAs His corporate reproduction.", "3 Living out His resurrection,\nDying to the flesh and soul-life.\nLiving by the mingled spirit,\nNatural man we will deny.\nNow we're living in the Body,\nEvery day we're overcoming,\nStriving for the peak of Zion,\nWatching for our Lord's appearing.", "4 God and man will have one living,\nAlways in the mingled spirit;\nWe two are incorporated \nOne organic entity!\nThis the vision of the ages\nWill control our daily living\nThat the Lord may have His Body\nShining as the holy city."]
