["1 If there's such love in the human race,\nTo meet all our need with wondrous grace,\nFirm and endless and free,\nLike the high mount and sea,\nOur dear Lord need not a human be;\nIn the dark, He has heard,\nHow I sigh, how I pine,\nOn the way, He has seen,\nHow I wander in life.", "2 In His love to us He has drawn nigh,\nComing to us from His throne on high.\nSeeking me without rest,\nThirst and hunger did taste,\nOn the cross the Lord paid all my debt,\nHe arose from the grave,\nAll the sinners He saved,\nJoined with me, He filled me with His faith.", "3 Love I've found within the human race,\nOf all love in heav'n and earth the best,\nFirm and endless and free,\nLike the high mount and sea,\nTrue and precious, through eternity;\nHe's with me all my days,\nLeading me all the way;\nO my Lord, O my love, \"I love You!\" 'Tis my prayer."]
