["1 Born of my father, descended from Adam,\nA life in my flesh is God's enemy.\nI have inherited God's condemnation,\nDeath and sin were reigning in me.", "2 But love eternal appeared and He called me,\nOut from the lost and hopeless race.\nInto His Son now I have been transferred,\nBorn of the Spirit, into His grace.", "3 I am God's child now, free to enjoy Him.\nThe Spirit of Life is reigning in me.\nChrist is my walking, my living, my breathing,\nAll that I have and ever will be.", "4 Chosen and guided into His purpose,\nFrom individual to corporate man.\nNow in His Body, we can experience\nAll the unlimited grace of His plan.", "5 This is the mystery hidden from ages.\nFor this God brought us from sinner to son.\nPractical church life, daily transforming\nInto the oneness, God's expression."]
