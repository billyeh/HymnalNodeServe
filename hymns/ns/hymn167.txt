["1 I always knew deep down in me\nThere was a longing to be free,\nA kind of hunger deep inside-\nTo fill it up, I tried and tried.\nThere were a lot of things I had;\nSome things were good,\nSome things were bad.\nBut all those things of mine before\nDon't satisfy me anymore.", "chorus Now life affords a real reward\nWhenever I just call \"O Lord!\"\nThe Triune God the Spirit is,\nAnd He can fill mine up with His.", "2 Thank You, Lord Jesus, for the wine\nThat I enjoy as life divine.\nI thank You, Lord, for mercy all\nThat opened me to heed Your call.\nO Lord, now make Your home my heart\nAnd fully saturate each part.\nO Lord, my words just can't express\nThe way You've filled my emptiness!", "chorus O Lord, I know that You will grow\nAnd from my spirit overflow.\nLord, saturate me through and through-\nO Lord Jesus, I love You.", "3 I always knew deep down in me\nThere was a longing to be free.\nA kind of hunger deep inside-\nBut now it can be satisfied...\nChrist in my heart-the only way\nTo spread within me day by day.\nLord Jesus! Lord, I have to say\nYou're home in me and home to stay!", "chorus O Lord, I know now You will grow\nAnd from my spirit overflow!\nNow saturate me through and through!\nO Lord Jesus, I love You!\nO Lord Jesus, I love You!\nO Lord Jesus, I love You!"]
