["1 He understands you thoroughly;\nThere's nothing He does not know.\nAll your problems and weaknesses\nDon't say it isn't so!\nHe's your Helper, sympathizing.\nHe's the Spirit. Don't neglect Him.\nHe's praying for you\nAnd sustaining you.", "2 He gives support and comforts you,\nInterceding night and day.\nAnd when you're weak He groans for you\nWith words you cannot say.\nHe's the Spirit, interceding.\nHe's the Spirit. Don't neglect this\nWonderful One,\nWho is praying for you.", "3 So many times we are so weak,\nBut Someone deep within\nSupplies the very help we need,\nAnd we're upheld by Him.\nHe says, \"Don't be disappointed.\"\nHe knows all your fears and failures;\nHe's praying for you\nAs no one else can do."]
