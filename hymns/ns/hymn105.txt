["1 Fallen, that's the way we all begin:\nImprisoned by the evil fate we're in.\nHow can we from this hard world of sin\nbe saved?", "chorus Just by calling, \"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.\"\nEvery moment, each day!\nCalling on the name of Jesus-\nWe're finding is the way.\nIt's Jesus, Lord Jesus!", "2 Even though we love the Lord so much,\nSomehow, it seems we get out of touch\nWith Jesus. How can we be freed from such\ndistress?", "3 Sometimes we know we aren't being real\nThen times, we just live by how we feel.\nIs there some way we could ever deal\nwith self?", "4 Christians, scattered throughout all the earth\nAre wand'ring-Lord, where is Your Bride of worth?\nHow can all those of the second birth\nbe one?"]
