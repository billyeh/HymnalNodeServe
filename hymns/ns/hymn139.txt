["1 I thought I knew You, I did not love You;\nI thought I met You, I had only heard of You.\nYou whispered to me, I shut my ears, Lord.\nYou tried to show me that You could be something more.\n\nAnd then You caught me-\nThe great love You had for me-\nI could not help but love Thee.\nLord, Your compassion had drawn me so entirely.\nAt last, I glimpsed Your beauty.", "2 I felt so filthy, You shone on my sin.\nI asked Your pardon, then You cleansed me from within.\nMy eyes were opened, now I could see You.\nYou were more real than anything I ever knew.\n\nAnd then You freed me-\nYou hung and died on a tree-\nI wasn't even worthy.\nLord, then You found me and rescued me from my sins.\nLord, You are full of mercy."]
