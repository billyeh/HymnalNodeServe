["1 Oh Lord, for this I pray: \"Make my heart the good earth\nSo that You may grow in me, grow and grow continually.\nOh Lord, may this living incorruptible seed\nWithin me enlivening, grow unto maturity.", "chorus Let Your life within me saturate,\nLet Your life within me permeate.\nMay all Your fulness be expressed through me\nAnd my being be conformed to Thee.", "2 Renew my mind, oh Lord, day by day dispense Your life;\nMy wandering thoughts purify completely;\nReplace my will, oh Lord, with Your will that I would say", \"Oh Lord, Amen,\" always trusting You, following You.", "3 Increase my love for You so that I would love You,\nReturn Your love with Yours, responding to Your call;\nReveal more of Yourself to me so I can see\nYour divine economy, shine on me Your speaking."]
