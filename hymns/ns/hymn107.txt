["1 Loving You, Lord's all I'm living for;\nLoving You, Lord, to the uttermost.\nLord, forgive me if I've left my first love,\nThat's the bridal love to You.\nYou are more than any one I love.\nYou are more than anything I have,\nEven my dear self; nothing can compare\nTo my beloved Bridegroom.", "chorus I give You the first place in all things by faith.\nLet nothing take Your place in all my heart.\nInfuse me with Yourself abundantly\n'Til we meet, dear Lord.\nI'll love You with the best love.", "2 You've the right to take all that I love,\nBut replace it with Yourself much more.\nYou are what I need, give Yourself to me,\nDo not give all that I want.\nEverything is sure to pass away,\nEveryone is going their own way.\nBut I still have You and You have me too,\nLoving one another's sweet.", "3 I treasure my time alone with You,\nJust to gain the best love You long for.\nMy dearest Husband, draw me with Yourself\nInto Your chambers right now.\nBe the first in all my work and life,\nBe the first in all my service too.\nIn relationships, You must be the first;\nHave preeminence in me."]
