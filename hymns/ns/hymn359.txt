["1 Me He sought, a lost and wand'ring lamb,\nMe He bought, His life outpoured;\nI receive His life divine,\nKnow, enjoy Him evermore.\nO my Lord, how I love Thee!\nI can't help but sink in Thee!\nBy such great love I'm moved, constrained,\nAll my life I give to Thee.", "2 You're so sweet, my brook, my pasture green,\nWaking me, to righteous paths,\n'Tis by faith that I'm empow'red\nTo live out Thy righteousness.\nThough the world would bring me woe,\nTide of age would ebb and flow,\nYet, Lord, Thy love cannot be swayed,\nIn Thy care, no lack I know.", "3 When my sense of Thy dear presence fades,\nWhen I lose all touch with Thee,\nThough my heart is caught in doubt,\nRod and staff, they comfort me.\nLife by faith, I surely know,\nShepherd leads me as I go\nHere as I feast before my foes,\nCup of blessing overflows.", "4 Foll'wing Thee, Good Shepherd, I would feed,\nShepherd those allotted me,\nE'er I'd touch Thy heart's desire,\nLive in Thine economy.\nO my Lord, All thanks to Thee!\nGoodness, mercy follow me;\nI'd ever dwell within Thy house,\nAs Thy Body glorious!"]
