["1 Have you found your human spirit?\nIt's connected to your mouth!", \"Hallelujah, O Lord Jesus!\"\nThat's the way to let it out.", "chorus What is born of God is our human spirit-\nPraise God, the job has been done!\nWhat is born of Spirit is just our spirit,\nAnd the two spirits are one.", "2 Don't wait for an inspiration-\nThat's the subtle enemy.\nOpen up! Release your spirit,\nTestifying you are free."]
