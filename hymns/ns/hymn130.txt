["1 Lord, how I thank You that\nYou died on the cross for me.\nYour mercy, my Savior, reached me.\nAnd Lord, You paid the highest price,\nMy life bought with Your shed blood,\nMy life now belongs, Lord, to You.\n\nAnd Lord, how can I turn away from Your love,\nThe eternal love which You have for me?\nI give You my heart;\nLord, spread in every part,\nTill my whole heart belongs to You.", "2 Lord gain my heart so that\nIt is single and pure for You.\nNo other love, Lord would I know.\nLord I am so in love with You.\nFor You are so lovely,\nMy everything, my all in all.\n\nAnd Lord, I really want to know\nThis Person inside of me.\nLord, keep my heart open to You.\nKeep flowing Your life,\nInto me that I would grow,\nAnd be saturated with You."]
