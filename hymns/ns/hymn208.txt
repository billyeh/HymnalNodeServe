["1 There are three kinds of life in our existence today:\nThere is Bios, the physical, and soul-life, Psuche;\nNow the third life is God's life and its called Zoe;\nAnd we all have to choose what life we'll live by today.", "chorus Oh, it's God in Christ Jesus, through the Spirit today,\nWho is flowing within us, flowing through us this way.\nWe don't care for the Bios; we don't want Psuche;\nAll we want is God's Zoe life to fill us today.", "2 We don't care for the Bios, we don't care for the soul.\nWe don't care for the cares of life, world's pleasure and show.\nWe don't care for the pride of life, the flesh and sin-\nWe say, \"No!\" to the soul life, we'll take God's life within.", "3 Do you know what God's life is? Well, just listen to this:\nIt is God in Christ Jesus through the Spirit-no less!\nHe is flowing within us, He is flowing through-\nHallelujah! He's moving to make everything new.", "4 We have this Life within us, in our spirit today;\nTo our spirit we turn, O Lord, and take You this way.\nWe can overcome Bios and the Psuche too;\nHallelujah, the Spirit of the Lord takes us through."]
