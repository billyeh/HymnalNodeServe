["1 Simply loving everyday;\nLoving through a stormy way,\nEven when my faith is small,\nLoving Jesus, that is all.", "chorus Loving as the moments fly,\nLoving as the days go by,\nLoving Him whate'er befall,\nLoving Jesus, that is all.", "2 Brightly doth His Spirit shine\nInto this poor heart of mine;\nWhile He leads I cannot fall,\nLoving Jesus, that is all.", "3 Singing if my way be clear,\nPraying if the path be drear;\nIf in danger, for Him call,\nLoving Jesus, that is all.", "4 Loving Him while life shall last,\nLoving Him till earth is past,\nTill His gracious advent call,\nLoving Jesus, that is all."]
