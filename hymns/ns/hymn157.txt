["1 We're renewed and revived by the Lord day by day;\nHe is grace upon grace and refreshing as dew.\nShining brighter and brighter, our path's a clear way,\nAs morning by morning His mercies are new.", "2 Transformed by beholding from glory to glory,\nAnd from strength to strength on to Zion we go.\nConstitute us with truth as daily we study-\nHere a little there a little-Your Word to know.", "3 Perfected and nourished from house to house meeting,\nWe speak one by one that the church may be built.\nAs little by little ev'ry enemy's fleeing,\nMore and more surpassingly with glory we're filled.", "chorus Day by day,\nGrace upon grace,\nBrighter and brighter,\nMorning by morning\n(His mercies are new.)", "chorus Glory to glory,\nStrength to strength,\nHere a little,\nThere a little\n(Your Word to know.)", "chorus House to house,\nOne by one,\nLittle by little,\nMore and more\n(With glory we're filled.)"]
