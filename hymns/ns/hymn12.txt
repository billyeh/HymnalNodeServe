["1 Father, I know that all my life is portioned out for me,\nAnd the changes that are sure to come I do not fear to see;\nBut I ask Thee for a present mind intent on pleasing Thee.", "2 I ask Thee for a thoughtful love, through constant watching wise,\nTo meet the glad with joyful smiles, and to wipe the weeping eyes;\nAnd a heart at leisure from itself, to soothe and sympathize.", "3 I would not have the restless will that hurries to and fro,\nSeeking for some great thing to do or secret thing to know;\nI would be treated as a child, and guided where I go.", "4 Wherever in the world I am, in whatso'er estate,\nI have a fellowship with hearts to keep and cultivate;\nAnd a work of lowly love to do for the Lord on whom I wait.", "5 So I ask Thee for the daily strength, to none that ask denied,\nAnd a mind to blend with outward life while keeping at Thy side;\nContent to fill a little space, if Thou be glorified.", "6 And if some things I do not ask in my cup of blessing be,\nI would have my spirit filled the more with grateful love to Thee,\nMore careful, not to serve Thee much, but to please Thee perfectly.", "7 There are briers besetting every path that call for patient care;\nThere is a cross in every lot, and an earnest need for prayer;\nBut a lowly heart that leans on Thee is happy anywhere.", "8 In a service which Thy will appoints there are no bonds for me;\nFor my inmost heart is taught \"the truth\" that makes Thy children \"free\"\nAnd a life of self-renouncing love is a life of liberty."]
