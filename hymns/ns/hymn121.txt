["1 Draw me, Lord;\nLest these earthly cares consume\nMy driven soul.\nMove me Lord;\nAs a coursing river turns\nWithin Thine hands.", "chorus Draw me, Lord!\nDraw me, Lord!", "2 Capture me;\nBe the conqueror of this\nWild, charging mare.\nWin me Lord,\nAnd subdue all pow'r of self\nTo yield to Thee.", "3 Draw me, Lord;\nEv'ry heartbeat tends to drift\nMy course from Thee.\nDraw me, Lord;\nI would gladly let Thee win\nAnd yield my sword.", "4 Draw me, Lord;\nOh, Thy love compels me as\nAn ocean's tide!\nDraw me, Lord;\nFor Thy drawing maketh hearts\nTo fast pursue."]
