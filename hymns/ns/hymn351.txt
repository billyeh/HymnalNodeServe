["1 Jesus Lord, my best love Thou art,\nThou hast fully captured my heart;\nThere is none in heav'n nor on earth like Thee,\nWith Thy beauty none can compete.\nWhen Thy voice first came to my ear,\nWhisp'ring in my heart words most dear,\nAll past loves and aims lost their charm for me,\nAll my boasts so vain now appear.", "chorus Throughout all the world, who compares with Thee?\nWho so full of worth, who so fair and sweet?\nOnly Thou art worthy my love to win,\nO Lord Jesus, how I love Thee!\n\nNo more I who live, no more self-deceived,\nNo more in the self's world indulged to be,\nDeep within I know You're my only love,\nMy best love is none else but Thee!", "2 Jesus Lord, my best love Thou art,\nRid all rocks that hide in my heart;\nGladly I Thy bondslave of love would be,\nOne heart, one will ever with Thee\nThough my heart is oft not subdued,\nStill Thy way alone it would choose;\nAll I yearn for is what Thy heart desires,\nIn Thy love alone peace I find.", "3 Jesus Lord, my best love Thou art,\nNe'er again from Thee I'd depart;\nNever hide Thy dear, smiling face from me.\nTo none else I'd cling, Lord, but Thee.\nTo Thee, Lord, my all I outpour,\nHow Thy love my heart deeply fills,\nMy eternal portion, most precious Lord,\nNone but Thee I want evermore."]
