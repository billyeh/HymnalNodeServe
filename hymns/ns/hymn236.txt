["chorus Lord, in these days I want to set my heart,\nEver and only, always on You,\nThat I would not defiled be,\nKeeping my heart so single and pure for Thee.", "1 Lord, write Your law, inscribe on our hearts,\nThat this law of life, would of us be part,\nWe are so hopeless, yet we hope in Him,\nPreparing a way for Christ to come in.", "2 Lord as the fountain You'd want us to drink,\nAlways supplying, it's my only link,\nStaying connected to this precious flow,\nPlanting my roots here that they would grow.", "3 You are the Potter, we are the clay,\nForm now the church, Your expression today,\nIn Christ there's nothing that we may lack,\nAs now Your Body, we'd bring You back."]
