["1 I've got a river of life flowing within me;\nIt makes the lame to walk and the blind to see.\nIt opens prison doors, sets the captives free.\nI've got a river of life flowing within me.", "chorus Spring up, O well, within my spirit!\nRise up and tell, so all can hear it!\nSpring up, O well, so I experience\nThat life abundantly.", "2 I've got a river of life flowing within me;\nIt started gushing up when God set me free.\nThat I keep the flow is my only plea.\nI've got a river of life springing within me.", "3 Once I call His name there's a flow within;\nIt turns me from my day, makes Him Lord again.\nAs my spirit burns, Satan cannot win.\nCalling, \"Oh Lord Jesus,\" keeps the flow within."]
