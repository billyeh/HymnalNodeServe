["1 One day as the Lord passed a well,\nA woman so thirsty was there.\nHe was not content until\nHe left her the water that's real, pure, and clear.\nOh, come see a man,\nOh, come see a man,\nWho told me all things that ever I did.\nIs this not the Christ?\nIs this not the Christ?\nHe fills me forever and ever! Amen.", "chorus Oh, come see a man,\nOh, come see a man,\nWho told me all things that ever I did.\nIs this not the Christ?\nIs this not the Christ?\nHe fills me forever and ever! Amen.", "2 He spoke words that I'd never heard,\nYet how He did stir up my thirst!\nHe spoke of the water that lives,\nTo all who are thirsty, He freely will give.", "3 Now this living water have I!\nI drink and I soar to the sky!\nHis praises now fill all the air\nBecause I am speaking Him, now, everywhere!"]
