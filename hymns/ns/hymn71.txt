["1 I have lived my life by myself,\nNever letting You get too close to me,\nKept my heart preoccupied with empty things;\nMy eyes have failed to see.\n\nBut You had called me,\nHow could I explain,\nAll the things I thought were real were vain.", "2 Deceived by sin since cunning words\nHe made me hold in things that fade away\nHe weighs my ears, and keeps me bound;\nNever letting me out of his domain.\n\nAnd then You freed me,\nTransferred from the place,\nBrought into the kingdom of Your grace.", "3 Bring me to be with others, Lord,\nThat we express Your Person corporately.\nA living stone for building now,\nMake us to be Your Body, one with Thee.\n\nLord, keep growing,\nYour building would complete, \nOne in Christ for all the world to see."]
