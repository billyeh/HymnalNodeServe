["1 He didn't stay home;\nHe went and visited people.\nHe didn't stay home;\nJesus taught disciples.\nFed the following crowd outdoors;\nMade them glad forevermore;\nServing's what His life was for;\nHe didn't stay home. SO!!!!!", "2 Don't stay home! (go, go!)\nGo and visit people!\nDon't stay home! (go, go!)\nGo and teach disciples. (GO!)\nFix some food, go out the door;\nMake them glad forevermore;\nServing is what life is for,\nSo DON'T STAY HOME!!", "copyright  2012 Bible StorySongs, Inc.
