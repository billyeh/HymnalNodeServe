["1 Plants, fish, birds, and animals and man,\nAll things created by God through His Word.\nAmong all these He made one specially,\nSpecially to love Him.\nNow which one could it be?", "2 Plants, fish, birds, and animals and man,\nAll things created God through His Word.\nIf you look upon the face of all the land,\nOnly one can love the Lord.\nThe only one is man!"]
