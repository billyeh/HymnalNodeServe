["1 The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.\nHe makes me to lie down in green pastures;\nHe leads me beside still waters.", "2 He restores my soul: \"He guides me.\nIn the paths of righteousness\nFor His Name's sake.", "3 Even though I walk through the valley,\nThe valley of the shadow of death;\nEven though I walk through the valley,\nThe valley of the shadow of death;\nI fear no evil for Thou art with me;\nThy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.", "4 Thou dost prepare a table for me\nIn the presence of mine enemies\nAnd anointest my head with oil.", "5 Only goodness and mercy will follow me\nAll the days of my life,\nOnly goodness and mercy will follow me\nAll the days of my life,\nAnd I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."]
