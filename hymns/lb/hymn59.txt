["1 I love You, Lord Jesus,\nYou're worthy of my life.\nI relinquish all control\nAnd give You every right.\nOnly You, only You,\nYou're the One attracting me!\nIn all things, nothing may I see\nOr want but You!", "2 Every concept, all desires,\nI now forsake for You!\nShine on all that I can't see,\nOn all that is not You!\nLive Your life, live Your life.\nI've been crucified with You.\nEvery moment, I would live in oneness,\nLord, with You!", "3 When I struggle, grant me grace\nTo turn my eyes on You!\nKeep my heart so close to You,\nMy love, so fresh and new!\nCome in, Lord! Come in more!\nI would seek none else but You!\nAll my life, my love, my all, I pour it,\nLord, on You!"]
