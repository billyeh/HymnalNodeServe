["1 Lord, keep my heart always true to You,\nNever backsliding, always viewing You,\nA heart that is pure that sees only You,\nA heart that loves You and treasures only You.", "chorus Your love constrains me to give my all to You.\nLord, I can't help it; my heart is drawn to You.\nOh what a privilege! I give myself to You!\nI love You, Lord, dearest Lord.\nI love You! I just love You!", "2 Lord, keep my love burning brightly for You,\nA love never dwindling always hot for You,\nA love, shining brighter all the way for You,\nA love, so fresh like the day I first touched You.", "3 Lord, take my life, I present it to You!\nIf I had a thousand, I'd pour all on You!\nNothing withholding, my all is for You.\nMy life and my future, dear Lord, is all for You."]
