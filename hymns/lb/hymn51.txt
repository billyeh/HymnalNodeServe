["1 I do not know where they have laid Him.\nThe stone is taken away from the tomb.\nOh! They have taken Him away!\nOh! Where is He?", "2 Disciples came and saw the empty tomb\nBut went away so soon to their own homes.\nThey're satisfied with just the facts.\nBut where's my Lord?", "chorus Where is He, my Jesus?\nWhere is He, my Beloved?\nWhere is He Whom my soul doth love?\nJesus, my Love, I just want You.", "3 My heart is broken from my deepest need.\nDon't ask me, angels, why I'm weeping.\nNothing but Jesus fills my inner being.\nOh! Where's my Love?", "4 Someone is standing right behind me.\nIt's just the gardener I can barely see.\nSir, if you carried Him away...\nOh! Where is He?", "chorus Where is He my Jesus?\nWhere is He my Beloved?\nTell me where you have laid Him\nAnd I'll carry Him away, I'll carry Him away.", "5 And then I heard a voice say, \"Mary.\"\nThat sweetest voice that penetrated me.\nIt is the voice of my Beloved,\nJesus, my Love.", "chorus I have found my Jesus!\nI have found my Beloved!\nI have found Whom my soul doth love,\nJesus, my love, I just love You!", "6 But Jesus told me not to touch Him yet.\nHe must ascend first to the Father\nAnd to My Father and your Father\nTo My God and your God.", "chorus Go and tell My brothers,\nI ascend to the Father\nTo My Father and your Father,\nAnd My God and your God, go tell My brothers."]
