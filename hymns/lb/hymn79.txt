["1 Life is God the Father\nIn Christ Jesus as the Spirit\nFlowing out and coming into us.\nHe's not just a teaching,\nOr a creed or a dead doctrine,\nBut the processed Triune God, glorious!", "2 Life is not created\nAs man's body, soul, and spirit-\nThat's man's life that's weak and temporal.\nLife is uncreated.\nIt's divine and it's eternal.\nAnd this is the life that's indestructible.", "3 And this life came in us\nIn our spirit through the Spirit;\nThis is where we were made alive!\nNow this life is spreading.\nLord, don't stop-just keep invading.\nFor this, Lord, we must be daily revived.", "4 Life needs our maintaining,\nOtherwise we're suffocating.\nCalling on His name we breathe Him in.\nEverywhere we breathe Him,\nMakes us fresh and makes us living.\nO, this life is full of hope and meaning.", "5 In our daily living\nIt's this life that we are sensing.\nAre we in the flesh or in the Lord?\nIf you're dead and empty\nAnd the troubles you have plenty,\nSaints, get out of there and flee back to the Lord!", "6 Then you'll sense life flowing\nIt's this life that's overcoming\nSatan, flesh, and the world, and sin.\nWhat a life we're having.\nLord, Your virtues manifesting,\nThus, we're branches bearing fruit in John 15."]
