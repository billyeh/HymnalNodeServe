["1 When we are with unveiled face\nBeholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord,\nHe infuses us with the elements\nOf what He is and of what He has done.", "chorus But we all with unveiled face,\nBeholding and reflecting\nLike a mirror the glory of the Lord,\nAre being transformed\nInto the same image\nFrom glory to glory,\nEven as from the Lord Spirit.", "2 Thus we are being transformed\nMetabolic'lly to have His life-shape\nBy His life-pow'r with His life-essence,\nTransfigured by renewing our mind."]
