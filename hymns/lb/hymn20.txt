["1 What's the use? There is no hope for me,\nDeep inside just fear and misery.\nMan's enslaved by this haunting melody-\nEverything, my friend, is temporary.", "chorus There is an answer: \"a wonderful Person!\nHe's Jesus the Lord; He's God's beloved Son!\nThis wonderful Person is now your solution.\nJust take and receive Him; He's God's Firstborn Son!", "2 Day by day, I tried to stop this song.\nWhat is it? There must be something wrong...\nOh! This life is just a hopelessness!\nAlways searching, but tasting emptiness.", "chorus There is an answer: \"a wonderful Person!\nHe's Jesus the Lord; He's God's beloved Son!\nThis wonderful Person is now your solution.\nJust take and receive Him; He's God's Firstborn Son!", "3 All day long you play the \"same ole song\":\n\"Good morning", \"How are you?", \"No, there is nothing wrong.\"\nYou're swept by the world of deceptive vanity,\nA tide looking good, but it's void of reality.", "chorus Just call \"Oh Lord Jesus the truth you're confessing\nThat God raised this Jesus from among the dead.\nYour heart this believing, just call to receive Him.\nHe's Jesus the Savior, your great salvation.", "4 You're conformed to unreality,\nTrapped in a wheel of human anxiety.\nYou are caught, you're in the web already.\nYou're spun to this song: \"you're just the spider's prey.", "chorus Jesus crushed the devil and overcame evil.\nThat kingdom He leveled and destroyed the devil.\nHe will free you from sin, from death, world and Satan.\nJust call \"Oh Lord Jesus\" and He will enter in.", "5 Life is a song as a time hour glass,\nSand by sand, my friend it cannot last.\nYou're born, you live, and eventually you die.\nFriend, you can't change it, no need to even try.", "chorus There is a new song, a wonderful Person!\nHe's Jesus the Lord, He's God's beloved Son!\nThis wonderful Person is now your solution!\nJust take and receive Him; He's God's Firstborn Son!"]
