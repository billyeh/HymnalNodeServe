["1 I've tried in vain a thousand ways\nMy fears to quell, my hopes to raise;\nBut what I need, the Bible says,\nIs ever, only Jesus.", "2 My soul is night, my heart is steel-\nI cannot see, I cannot feel;\nFor light, for life I must appeal\nIn simple faith to Jesus.", "3 He died, He lives, He reigns, He pleads;\nThere's love in all His words and deeds;\nThere's all a guilty sinner needs\nForevermore in Jesus.", "4 Though some should sneer, and some should blame,\nI'll go with all my guilt and shame;\nI'll go to Him because His name,\nAbove all names, is Jesus."]
