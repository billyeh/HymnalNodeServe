["1 The love of God is greater far\nThan tongue or pen can ever tell.\nIt goes beyond the highest star\nAnd reaches to the lowest hell.\nThe guilty pair, bowed down with care,\nGod gave His Son to win;\nHis erring child He reconciled\nAnd pardoned from his sin.", "chorus O love of God, how rich and pure!\nHow measureless and strong!\nIt shall forevermore endure\nThe saints' and angels' song.", "2 When hoary time shall pass away,\nAnd earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;\nWhen men who here refuse to pray,\nOn rocks and hills and mountains call;\nGod's love, so sure, shall still endure,\nAll measureless and strong;\nRedeeming grace to Adam's race-\nThe saints' and angels' song.", "3 Could we with ink the ocean fill,\nAnd were the skies of parchment made;\nWere every stalk on earth a quill,\nAnd every man a scribe by trade;\nTo write the love of God above\nWould drain the ocean dry;\nNor could the scroll contain the whole,\nThough stretched from sky to sky.\",\ncopyright: \"Words & Music  1923, Ren. 1951 by Hope Publishing Co., Carol Stream, IL 60188."]
