["1 We love Thy coming, Lord!\nWe know not when 'twill be,\nBut turn from all distracting things\nThine own dear face to see.", "2 We serve the living God\nAnd wait His Son to see;\nFor this we need faith, love, and hope,\nIncreasing constantly.", "3 In Thy dear presence, Lord,\nWe hope we all may be\nA crown of glory and a joy\nTo those we then shall see.", "4 We love Thy coming, Lord;\nThe time is very nigh.\nOur hearts unblameable must be\nTo greet Thee from on high.", "5 The Lord Himself shall come\nWith loud assembling word,\nAnd all the saints in Christ shall be\nForever with the Lord.", "6 We're children of the day,\nWe're children of the light;\nThat day should never come to us\nAs does a thief at night.", "7 Lord, wholly sanctify\nAnd blameless let us be\nIn spirit, soul, and body too\nFor that blest day with Thee."]
