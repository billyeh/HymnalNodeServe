["1 How tedious and tasteless the hours\nWhen Jesus no longer I see!\nSweet prospects, sweet birds and sweet flow'rs,\nHave all lost their sweetness to me.\nThe midsummer sun shines but dim,\nThe fields strive in vain to look gay;\nBut when I am happy in Him\nDecember's as pleasant as May.", "2 His name yields the richest perfume,\nAnd sweeter than music His voice;\nHis presence disperses my gloom,\nAnd makes all within me rejoice.\nI should, were He always thus nigh,\nHave nothing to wish or to fear;\nNo mortal so happy as I;\nMy summer would last all the year.", "3 Content with beholding His face,\nMy all to His pleasure resigned;\nNo changes of season or place,\nWould make any change in my mind.\nWhile blessed with a sense of His love,\nA palace a toy would appear;\nAnd prisons would palaces prove,\nIf Jesus would dwell with me there.", "4 My Lord, if indeed I am Thine,\nIf Thou art my sun and my song,\nSay, why do I languish and pine?\nAnd why are my winters so long?\nOh, drive these dark clouds from the sky,\nThy soul-cheering presence restore;\nOr take me to Thee up on high,\nWhere winter and clouds are no more."]
