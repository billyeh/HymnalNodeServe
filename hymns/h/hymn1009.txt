["1 Would you be free from your burden of sin?\nThere's power in the blood, power in the blood;\nWould you o'er evil a victory win?\nThere's wonderful power in the blood.", "chorus There is power, power, wonder-working power,\nIn the blood of the Lamb;\nThere is power, power, wonder-working power,\nIn the precious blood of the Lamb.", "2 Would you be free from your passion and pride?\nThere's power in the blood, power in the blood;\nCome for a cleansing to Calvary's tide,\nThere's wonderful power in the blood.", "3 Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?\nThere's power in the blood, power in the blood;\nSin-stains are lost in its life-giving flow,\nThere's wonderful power in the blood.", "4 Would you do service for Jesus your King?\nThere's power in the blood, power in the blood;\nWould you live daily His praises to sing?\nThere's wonderful power in the blood."]
