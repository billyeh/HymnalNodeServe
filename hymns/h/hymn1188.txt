["1 Upon the throne of Jesus Christ\nWe've taken up our seat.\nThe world and Satan, sin and self\nAre all beneath our feet!\nChrist's finished work did put us here.\nWhen once for all He died;\nNo more are we the sinners poor,\nWe're fully glorified.", "2 We're dwelling in the house of God,\nThe church life glorious.\nThe shrinking-back, low Christian life,\nIs not the life for us!\nWe're passing through the Holy Place\nOf mind, emotion, will;\nWe're dwelling in the Holiest\nWhere God our being fills.", "3 We're under the New Covenant,\nWith glorious items, three:\nThe law of life, spontaneous,\nTransforming utterly;\nWe are His people, He's our God-\nOh, bless'd reality;\nWe all are fully able now\nTo know God inwardly.", "4 A supplement God added then;\nThis item we must know:\nChrist Jesus did put sin away\nTwo thousand years ago.\nNo memory of sin at all,\nIt's hist'ry, done and gone;\nIn spirit now the law of life\nWill take us swiftly on.", "5 Two things accomplished by our Lord\nOn Calvary's cross, we see:\nThe law of life, the end of sin!\nOur God's economy.\nSince all His work was finished there,\nHe entered into rest;\nNow on the throne He prays that we\nWill take our full bequest.", "6 We'll drop our former concepts, Lord,\nTo take this finished way;\nAppropriating each bequest,\nWe'll praise You more each day.\nWe'll heed our High Priest's inward call-\n\"Come forward!\" to the end-\nUntil we reach the final goal;\nThe New Jerusalem!"]
