["1 I love Thee, Jesus,\nAnd Thy love to me\nDraws me, ever to seek Thee\nAnd run after Thee,\nDraws me, ever to seek Thee\nAnd run after Thee.\nThou art beloved,\nYea! Altogether lovely,\nThe One in whom my heart delighteth.", "2 Thy love, Lord Jesus,\nIs sweeter than wine,\nAnd Thy fragrance of ointments\nMy heart doth entwine,\nAnd Thy fragrance of ointments\nMy heart doth entwine.\nA fount in gardens,\nA well of living waters,\nWhich streams and flows from Lebanon's mountains.", "3 O come Beloved,\nOn my garden blow,\nThat the odor of spices\nMay break forth and flow,\nThat the odor of spices\nMay break forth and flow.\nMy spouse, My sister,\nI'm come into My garden\nTo feast upon wine, milk and honey.", "4 Set me, Lord Jesus,\nAs seal on Thine heart;\nJealousy's cruel as Sheol,\nAnd love's strong as death,\nJealousy's cruel as Sheol,\nAnd love's strong as death.\nMuch water cannot\nQuench love, nor do floods drown it.\nAll man could give for love is contemned.\nnote: \"(Repeat the last three lines of each stanza)"]
