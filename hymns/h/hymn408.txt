["1 Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole,\nI want Thee forever to live in my soul;\nBreak down every idol, cast out every foe;\nNow wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.", "chorus Whiter than snow; yes, whiter than snow;\nNow wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.", "2 Lord Jesus, let nothing unholy remain,\nApply Thine own blood and extract every stain;\nTo get this blest cleansing I all things forego;\nNow wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.", "3 Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,\nAnd help me to make a complete sacrifice;\nI give up myself and whatever I know;\nNow wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.", "4 Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;\nI wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet;\nBy faith, for my cleansing I see Thy blood flow;\nNow wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.", "5 Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait;\nCome now, and within me a new heart create;\nTo those who have sought Thee Thou never saidst, No;\nNow wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."]
