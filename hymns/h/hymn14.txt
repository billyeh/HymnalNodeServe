["1 Immortal, invisible, God only wise,\nIn light inaccessible hid from our eyes,\nMost blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,\nAlmighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.", "2 Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,\nNor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;\nThy justice like mountains high soaring above,\nThy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.", "3 To all life Thou givest, to both great and small;\nIn all life Thou livest, the true life of all;\nWe blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,\nAnd wither and perish, but nought changeth Thee.", "4 Great Father of Glory, pure Father of Light\nThine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;\nAll laud we would render, O help us to see:\n'Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee.", "5 Immortal, invisible, God only wise,\nIn light inaccessible hid from our eyes,\nMost blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,\nAlmighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise."]
