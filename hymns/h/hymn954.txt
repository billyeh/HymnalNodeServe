["1 There's a light upon the mountains,\nand the day is at the spring,\nWhen our eyes shall see the beauty\nand the glory of the King;\nWeary was our heart with waiting, and\nthe night-watch seemed so long,\nBut His triumph-day is breaking, and\nwe hail it with a song.", "2 In the fading of the starlight we can\nsee the coming morn;\nAnd the lights of men are paling in\nthe splendors of the dawn;\nFor the eastern skies are glowing as\nwith lights of hidden fire,\nAnd the hearts of men are stirring\nwith the throb of deep desire.", "3 There's a hush of expectation, and\na quiet in the air;\nAnd the breath of God is moving in\nthe fervent breath of prayer;\nFor the suffering, dying Jesus is the\nChrist upon the throne,\nAnd the travail of our spirit is the\ntravail of His own.", "4 He is breaking down the barriers,\nHe is casting up the way;\nHe is calling for His angels to build\nup the gates of day;\nBut His angels here are human, not\nthe shining hosts above,\nFor the drum-beats of His army are\nthe heart-beats of our love.", "5 Hark! we hear a distant music, and\nit comes with fuller swell;\n'Tis the triumph song of Jesus, of\nour King Emmanuel;\nZion, go ye forth to meet Him,\nand my soul, be swift to bring\nAll thy sweetest and thy dearest for\nthe triumph of our King."]
