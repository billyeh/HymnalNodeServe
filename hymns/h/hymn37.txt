["1 O God! we see Thee in the Lamb\nTo be our hope, our joy, our rest;\nThe glories that compose Thy name\nStanding engaged to make us blest.", "2 Thou great and good! Thou just and wise!\nHail! as our Father and our God!\nFor we are Thine by sacred ties,\nThy sons and daughters-bought with blood.", "3 Then, Oh! to us this grace afford,\nThat far from Thee we ne'er may move;\nOur guard-the presence of the Lord;\nOur joy-Thy perfect present love.", "4 This gives us ever to rejoice,\nTurning to light our darkest days;\nAnd lifts on high each feeble voice,\nWhile we have breath to pray or praise."]
