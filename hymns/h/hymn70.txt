["1 There is a name I love to hear,\nI love to sing its worth;\nIt sounds like music in mine ear,\nThe sweetest name on earth.", "chorus Oh, how I love Jesus,\nOh, how I love Jesus,\nOh, how I love Jesus,\nBecause He first loved me!", "2 It tells me of a Savior's love,\nWho died to set me free;\nIt tells me of His precious blood,\nThe sinner's perfect plea.", "3 It tells me what my Father hath,\nIn store for every day,\nAnd though I tread a darksome path,\nYields sunshine all the way.", "4 It tells of One whose loving heart\nCan feel my deepest woe,\nWho in each sorrow bears a part\nThat none can bear below."]
