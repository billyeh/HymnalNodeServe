["1 It may be at morn as the day we are greeting;\nIt may be the time when the saints all are meeting;\nBut one thing we know, for the Spirit bears witness,\nThat Jesus will come very soon!", "chorus O Lord Jesus, Amen!\nThe church soon will see Thee again!\n\"Thou art coming! Hallelujah!\nHallelujah, Amen!\nHallelujah, Amen!\"", "2 The days hasten by-there's no time for delaying;\nSo grasping each moment by watching and praying\nAnd in everything giving thanks and rejoicing,\nWe'll welcome our Lord's return.", "3 An instant, a twinkling, and Jesus descending\nWill come for His saints in His glory transcending.\nHe'll come as the Bridegroom-as such we'll behold Him-\nTo take to Himself His Bride!", "4 What joy, what delight, when we finally meet Him!\nThe One whom we love-O what rapture to greet Him!\nOur Lord and our life, our Beloved, our Bridegroom\nWill take to Himself His Bride!"]
