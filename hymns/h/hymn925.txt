["1 Outreach of the glorious gospel,\nIs the flow of life within;\nIt is by our testimony,\nThat lost sinners we may win.", "chorus Grant us, Lord, the living outflow\nMay Thy life through us be seen;\nThrough us as Thy living vessels,\nQuicken people from within.", "2 It is by the life convincing,\nThat the people may believe;\nIt is by the life imparting,\nThat the souls may life receive.", "3 Always in the Lord abiding\nAs the branches fruit to bear;\nBy the inner life out-flowing,\nChrist with others we may share.", "4 May our living be the preaching\nMaking Christ to others known;\nNot the word of doctrine-preaching\nBut the seed of life be sown."]
