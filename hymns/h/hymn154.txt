["1 It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine,\nMy Savior, Jesus; yet this soul of mine\nWould of Thy love in all its breadth and length,\nIts height and depth, its everlasting strength,\nKnow more and more.", "2 It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine,\nMy Savior, Jesus; yet these lips of mine\nWould fain proclaim to sinners, far and near,\nA love which can remove all guilty fear,\nAnd love beget.", "3 It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine,\nMy Savior, Jesus; yet this heart of mine\nWould sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,\nWhich brings a rebel sinner, such as me,\nNigh unto God.", "4 But though I cannot sing, or tell, or know\nThe fulness of Thy love, while here below,\nMy empty vessel I may freely bring;\nO Thou, who art of love the living spring,\nMy vessel fill.", "5 I am an empty vessel-not one thought\nOr look of love to Thee I've ever brought;\nYet I may come, and come again to Thee,\nWith this the empty sinner's only plea,\nThou lovest me.", "6 Oh, fill me, Jesus, Savior, with Thy love!\nLead, lead me to the living fount above;\nThither may I, in simple faith draw nigh,\nAnd never to another fountain fly,\nBut unto Thee.", "7 Lord Jesus, when Thee face to face I see,\nWhen on Thy lofty throne I sit with Thee,\nThen of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,\nIts height and depth, its everlasting strength,\nMy soul shall sing."]
