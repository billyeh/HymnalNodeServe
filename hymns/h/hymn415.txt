["1 There is a foe whose hidden pow'r\nThe Christian well may fear,\nMore subtle far than inbred sin,\nAnd to the heart more dear.\nIt is the pow'r of selfishness,\nIt is the wilful I,\nAnd ere my Lord can live in me,\nMy very self must die.", "2 There is, like Anak's sons of old,\nA race of giants still:\nSelf-glorying, self-confidence,\nSelf-seeking and self-will.\nStill must these haughty Anakims\nBy Caleb's sword be slain,\nEre Hebron's heights of heav'nly love,\nOur conqu'ring feet can gain.", "3 Oh, save me from self-will, dear Lord,\nWhich claims Thy sacred throne;\nOh! let my will be lost in Thine,\nAnd let Thy will be done.\nOh, keep me from self-confidence,\nAnd self-sufficiency;\nLet me exchange my strength for Thine,\nAnd lean alone on Thee.", "4 Oh, save me from self-seeking, Lord,\nLet me not be my own;\nA living sacrifice I come,\nLord, keep me Thine alone.\nFrom proud vain glory save me, Lord,\nFrom pride of praise and fame;\nTo Christ be all the honor given,\nThe glory to His name.", "5 Oh, Savior. slay the self in me\nBy Thy consuming breath;\nShow me Thy heart, Thy wounds, Thy shame,\nThat self be put to death.\nWhen the Shekinah flame came down,\nE'en Moses could not stay;\nSo let Thy glory fill me now,\nAnd self forever slay."]
