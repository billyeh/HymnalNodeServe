["1 Amidst us our Beloved stands,\nAnd bids us view His pierced hands;\nPoints to the wounded feet and side,\nBlest emblems of the Crucified.", "2 What food luxurious loads the board\nWhen, at His table, sits the Lord!\nThe wine how rich, the bread how sweet,\nWhen Jesus deigns the guests to meet!", "3 If now, with eyes defiled and dim,\nWe see the signs, but see not Him;\nOh, may His love the scales displace,\nAnd bid us see Him face to face!", "4 Thou glorious Bridegroom of our hearts,\nThy present smile Thy grace imparts!\nOh, lift the veil, if veil there be,\nLet every saint Thy glory see!"]
