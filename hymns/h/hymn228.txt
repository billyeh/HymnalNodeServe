["1 Sweet feast of love divine!\n'Tis grace that makes us free\nTo feed upon this bread and wine,\nIn mem'ry, Lord, of Thee.", "2 Here every welcome guest\nWaits, Lord, from Thee to learn\nThe secrets of Thy Father's breast,\nAnd all Thy grace discern.", "3 Here conscience ends its strife,\nAnd faith delights to prove\nThe sweetness of the Bread of Life,\nThe fulness of Thy love.", "4 That blood that flowed for sin\nIn symbol here we see,\nAnd feel the blessed pledge within\nThat we are loved of Thee.", "5 O if this glimpse of love\nIs so divinely sweet,\nWhat will it be, O Lord, above,\nThy gladd'ning smile to meet!", "6 To see Thee face to face,\nThy perfect likeness wear,\nAnd all Thy ways of wondrous grace\nThrough endless years declare."]
