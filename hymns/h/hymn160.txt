["1 King of my life, I crown Thee now,\nThine shall the glory be;\nLest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow,\nLead me to Calvary.", "chorus Lest I forget Gethsemane;\nLest I forget Thine agony;\nLest I forget Thy love for me,\nLead me to Calvary.", "2 Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,\nTenderly mourned and wept;\nAngels in robes of light arrayed\nGuarded Thee while Thou slept.", "3 Let me like Mary, through the gloom,\nCome with a gift to Thee;\nShow to me now the empty tomb,\nLead me to Calvary.", "4 May I be willing, Lord, to bear\nDaily my cross for Thee;\nEven Thy cup of grief to share,\nThou hast borne all for me.", "5 Fill me, O Lord, with Thy desire\nFor all that know not Thee;\nThen touch my lips with holy fire,\nTo speak of Calvary."]
