["1 The church is Christ's deep longing\nAnd His good pleasure too.\nHis every word and action\nIs made with her in view.\nHis heart's love is established,\nAnd nought can Him deter;\nBefore the earth's foundation\nHis thoughts were filled with her.", "2 The eve of all creation\nHe mused on His delight,\nAnd pondered every feature,\nWell-pleasing in His sight.\nCreation sprang to being,\nBut deep in Him did hide\nA heart of depth unfathomed\nFixed on a glorious Bride.", "3 And thus His will was 'stablished\nHis counterpart to gain:\nThis blessed, firm intention,\nEternally the same.\nThough sin should e'en beguile man,\nThen mock his helpless state,\nHe never could forsake her,\nHis yearning ne'er abate.", "4 Then mercy richly flourished,\nAnd love was, oh, so vast,\nAs graciously He sought her\nWith wisdom unsurpassed.\nThe love He gave to win her\nGod only comprehends!\nHis life laid down, an offering\nWhose fragrance yet ascends.", "5 And now in resurrection\nTo her He draws most near,\nAnd with untold affection\nIn glory does appear.\nAs she beholds her Bridegroom,\nHis glory floods her heart,\n'Til she, His Bride, is raptured,\nHis longed-for counterpart."]
