["1 O how sweet the glorious message,\nSimple faith may claim;\nYesterday, today, forever,\nJesus is the same.\nStill He loves to save the sinful,\nHeal the sick and lame;\nCheer the mourner, still the tempest;\nGlory to His name!", "chorus Yesterday, today, forever,\nJesus is the same,\nAll may change, but Jesus never!\nGlory to His name,\nGlory to His name,\nGlory to His name;\nAll may change, but Jesus never!\nGlory to His name.", "2 He who was the friend of sinners,\nSeeks thee, lost one, now;\nSinner, come, and at His footstool,\nPenitently bow.\nHe who said, \"I'll not condemn thee,\nGo and sin no more,\"\nSpeaks to thee that word of pardon,\nAs in days of yore.", "3 Oft on earth He healed the suff'rer,\nBy His mighty hand;\nStill our sicknesses and sorrows,\nGo at His command.\nHe who gave His healing virtue,\nTo a woman's touch;\nTo the faith that claims His fulness,\nStill will give as much.", "4 As of old He walked to Emmaus,\nWith them to abide;\nSo through all life's way He walketh,\nEver near our side.\nSoon again we shall behold Him,\nHasten, Lord, the day!\nBut 'twill still be \"this same Jesus,\"\nAs He went away."]
