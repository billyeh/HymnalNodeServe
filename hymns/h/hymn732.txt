["1 My Father is rich in houses and lands,\nHe holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!\nOf rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,\nHis coffers are full, He has riches untold.", "chorus I'm a child of the King,\nA child of the King:\nWith Jesus my Savior,\nI'm a child of the King.", "2 My Father's own Son, the Savior of men,\nOnce wandered on earth as the poorest of them.\nBut now He is pleading our pardon on high,\nThat we may be His when He comes by and by.", "3 I once was an out-cast stranger on earth,\nA sinner by choice, and an alien by birth;\nBut I've been adopted, my name's written down,\nAn heir of salvation, the kingdom and crown.", "4 Though poor on this earth, oh, why should I care?\nSince glorious things for me God doth prepare;\nThough trials abound, yet, still I may sing:\nAll glory to God, I'm a child of the King."]
