["1 On Calvary's brow my Savior died\n'Twas there my Lord was crucified;\n'Twas on the cross He bled for me,\nAnd purchased there my pardon free.", "chorus O Calvary! dark Calvary!\nWhere Jesus shed His blood for me;\nO Calvary! blest Calvary!\n'Twas there my Savior died for me.", "2 'Mid rending rocks and darkening skies\nMy Savior bows His head and dies;\nThe opening veil reveals the way\nTo life divine and endless day.", "3 O Jesus, Lord, how can it be\nThat Thou shouldst give Thy life for me,\nTo bear the cross and agony\nIn that dread hour on Calvary!"]
