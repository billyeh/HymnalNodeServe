["1 Our faith to God-ward must in these days spread abroad\nTo show we've turned from idols to the living God.\nWe'll mix His Word with faith by answering \"Amen!\"\nAnd to Christ in the Word turn again and again.", "chorus Our work of faith must grow exceedingly,\nThe labor of our love increase abundantly,\nHis sanctifying work in us go on and on,\nWhile in patience of hope we will watch till He come.", "2 The love for all the brothers, in our midst is found,\nBut in these days our love must increase and abound.\nThe Lord direct our hearts into the love of God\nAnd prepare us in full for the day of the Lord.", "3 Our spirit, soul, and body wholly sanctified-\nOur faithful Lord will do it to prepare His Bride\nWhile we amen His voice in matters great or small,\nThat we all may be ready to hear Jesus' call.", "4 The Lord Himself shall come, and we shall be with Him-\nOh, what a glorious hope! Come quickly, Lord, Amen.\nWe'd ever watchful be to see Thee in the air\nAnd as sons of the day for that meeting prepare."]
