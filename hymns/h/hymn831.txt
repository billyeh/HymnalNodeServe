["1 The unity of Church is but,\nThe saints in oneness living;\nThe Spirit which indwelleth them,\nThis oneness ever giving.\nThus it is realized and called,\nThe unity of Spirit;\n'Tis based upon the common faith,\nWhich all the saints inherit.", "2 This precious faith of all the saints\nIs constituted solely,\nOf Christ and His redemptive work\nWhich are unique and holy.\nIn this the saints are truly one\nTogether all agreeing\nAnd it is from this common faith,\nThe Church came into being.", "3 The Church within the universe,\nIs one as Christ's possession;\nThe Church must therefore locally,\nBe one in her expression;\nFor all her elements are one-\nOne God, one Lord, one Spirit\nOne faith, baptism, Body too\nOne hope all saints inherit.", "4 This oneness is the Church's ground\nThe ground of common standing\nThe only ground of unity,\nThe Spirit is demanding.\nThe Church in actual practise thus,\nMay keep her vital union\nAnd her expressions locally,\nBe built up in communion.", "5 Lord, help us ever strive to keep,\nThis unity by taking,\nThe Church's ground of unity\nThe Body-life partaking\nThat all Thy heart's profound desire,\nMay fully be effected\nAnd God's eternal purpose may,\nCompletely be perfected."]
