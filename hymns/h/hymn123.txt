["1 Low in the grave He lay-\nJesus my Savior!\nWaiting the coming day-\nJesus my Lord!", "chorus Up from the grave He arose,\nWith a mighty triumph o'er His foes\nHe arose a Victor from the dark domain,\nAnd He lives forever with His saints to reign.\nHe arose! He arose!\nHallelujah! Christ arose!", "2 Vainly they watch His bed-\nJesus, my Savior!\nVainly they seal the dead-\nJesus my Lord!", "3 Death cannot keep his prey-\nJesus, my Savior!\nHe tore the bars away-\nJesus my Lord!"]
