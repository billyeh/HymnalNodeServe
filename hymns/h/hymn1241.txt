["1 God's life and building can be seen\nWithin the Song of Songs;\nHe shows by types His seeking ones,\nThe Bride for whom Christ longs!", "2 She, as a team of horses shows\nA love, so swift and strong!\nBut this is love that's natural-\nIt pulls the world along!", "3 As time goes by, her concepts change,\nWith dove's eyes she can see\nThat naught can with her love compare-\nThere's none so dear as He!", "4 A lily she is now to Him\n(For still the Lord draws on),\nHer faith is not in earthly toil,\nBut in the wondrous Son.", "5 She's next a dove who hides herself\nWithin the cloven rock;\nNow in her Lord's ascended life\nIs love which knows no shock!", "6 Of smoke, a pillar she's become,\nAnd now, as wand'ring ends,\nHer wills to His will are subdued,\nWhat fragrance sweet ascends!", "7 Behold His couch . . . (O, can this be?)\nE'en midst the fearsome night . . .\nShe now affords her Lord such rest,\nThe foe is put to flight!", "8 A vessel to contain the King!\n(This type is full of worth.)\nA palanquin He's made Himself\nFor His move on the earth!", "9 Of wood this vessel is composed:\nChrist's ris'n humanity.\nIts silver pillars for support\nAnd floor of gold we see!", "10 The seat of purple signifies\nChrist is of kings the King.\nTo Him, as fittings for within,\nTheir love His dear ones bring!", "11 The day will come-('tis surely soon)\nAnd glad will be Thy heart-\nWhat boast and glory to Thyself;\nThy crown, Thy counterpart!", "12 A garden fair, enclosed is she\nWith spices, fragrant, sweet.\nShe now brings forth materials\nThe building to complete!", "13 A city pleasant, comely, too;\nNo greater building, this!\nSo beautiful, yet to the foe\nA conq'ring army 'tis!", "14 As we eat Jesus, praise the Lord,\nThe transformation's done,\nUntil at last, the work's complete-\nChrist and His Bride are one!"]
