["1 Fight the good fight with all thy might!\nChrist is thy strength, and Christ thy right;\nLay hold on life, and it shall be\nThy joy and crown eternally.", "2 Run the straight race through God's good grace,\nLift up thine eyes, and seek His face;\nLife with its way before us lies,\nChrist is the path, and Christ the prize.", "3 Cast care aside, lean on thy Guide;\nHis boundless mercy will provide;\nTrust, and thy trusting soul shall prove\nChrist is its life, and Christ its love.", "4 Faint not nor fear, His arms are near,\nHe changeth not, and thou art dear;\nOnly believe, and thou shalt see\nThat Christ is all in all to thee."]
