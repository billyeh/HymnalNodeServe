["1 Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,\nAnywhere He leads me in this world below.\nAnywhere without Him, dearest joys would fade;\nAnywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.", "chorus Anywhere! anywhere! Fear I cannot know.\nAnywhere with Jesus I can safely go.", "2 Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone,\nOther friends may fail me, He is still my own.\nThough His hand may lead me over dreary way,\nAnywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.", "3 Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,\nWhen the darkling shadows round about me creep\nKnowing I shall waken never more to roam,\nAnywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home."]
