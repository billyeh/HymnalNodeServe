["1 I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,\nAnd it told Thy love to me;\nBut I long to rise in the arms of faith,\nAnd be closer drawn to Thee.", "chorus Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,\nTo the cross where Thou hast died;\nDraw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,\nTo Thy precious, bleeding side.", "2 Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,\nBy the pow'r of grace divine;\nLet my soul look up with a steadfast hope,\nAnd my will be lost in Thine.", "3 O the pure delight of a single hour\nThat before Thy throne I spend,\nWhen I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,\nI commune as friend with friend!", "4 There are depths of love that I yet may know\nEre Thee face to face I see;\nThere are heights of joy that I yet may reach\nEre I rest in peace with Thee."]
