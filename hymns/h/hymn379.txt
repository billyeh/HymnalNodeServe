["1 I hunger and I thirst;\nJesus, my manna be;\nYe living waters, burst\nOut of the rock for me.", "2 Thou bruised and broken Bread,\nMy lifelong wants supply;\nAs living souls are fed,\nO feed me, or I die.", "3 Thou true life-giving Vine,\nLet me Thy sweetness prove;\nRenew my life with Thine,\nRefresh my soul with love.", "4 For still the desert lies\nMy thirsting soul before;\nO living waters, rise\nWithin me evermore."]
