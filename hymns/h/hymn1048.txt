["1 Just as I am, without one plea,\nBut that Thy blood was shed for me,\nAnd that Thou bid'st me come to Thee,\nO Lamb of God, I come! I come!", "2 Just as I am, and waiting not\nTo rid my soul of one dark blot;\nTo Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,\nO Lamb of God, I come, I come!", "3 Just as I am, though tossed about\nWith many a conflict, many a doubt;\nFightings within, and fears without,\nO Lamb of God, I come, I come!", "4 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;\nSight, riches, healing of the mind;\nYes, all I need, in Thee to find,\nO Lamb of God, I come, I come!", "5 Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,\nWilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;\nBecause Thy promise I believe,\nO Lamb of God, I come, I come!", "6 Just as I am, Thy love unknown\nHas broken every barrier down;\nNow, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,\nO Lamb of God, I come, I come!"]
