["1 Say to this mountain, \"Go,\nBe cast into the sea!\"\nAnd doubt not in thine heart\nThat it shall be to thee.\nIt shall be done, doubt not His Word,\nCommand thy mountain in the Lord!", "2 Claim thy redemption right,\nPurchased by precious blood;\nThe Trinity unite\nTo make it true and good.\nIt shall be done, obey the Word,\nCommand thy mountain in the Lord!", "3 Self, sickness, sorrow, sin,\nThe Lord did meet that day\nOn His beloved One,\nAnd thou art \"loosed away.\"\nIt shall be done, rest on His Word!\nCommand thy mountain in the Lord!", "4 Compass the frowning wall\nWith silent prayer, then raise-\nBefore its ramparts fall-\nThe victor's shout of praise.\nIt shall be done, faith rests assured,\nCommand thy mountain in the Lord!", "5 The two-leaved gates of brass,\nThe bars of iron yield,\nTo let the faithful pass,\nConquerors in every field.\nIt shall be done, the foe ignored,\nCommand thy mountain in the Lord!", "6 Take then the faith of God,\nFree from the taint of doubt;\nThe wonder-working rod\nThat casts all reasoning out.\nIt shall be done, stand on the Word.\nCommand thy mountain in the Lord!"]
