["1 God's own Word must not be taken,\nJust as knowledge but as life\nNot alone God's thought conveying\nBut Himself to us as life;\nNot alone God's mind revealing\nBut His Christ as life within\nNot alone the teaching giving\nBut experience of Him.", "2 It is only knowledge to us,\nIf we in the letter read\nBut when reading in the spirit,\nIt is truly life indeed.\nAll the knowledge in the letter,\nOnly brings us into death\nBut the Word in spirit taken,\nGives to us the quickening breath.", "3 If we miss the Lord in Scripture\nIt is just as knowledge vain;\nBut when Christ we touch within it\nThen His life we may obtain.\nWhen we read, the Lord not touching\n'Tis but mental stimulus;\nBut when Christ we touch by reading\nIt becometh life in us.", "4 All the knowledge of the Scriptures,\nInto life must be transformed\nAll the mental understanding,\nIn the spirit must be formed;\nAll the Scriptural understanding,\nMust become the life received\nAll the knowledge of the letters,\nIn the spirit be conceived.", "5 Just to touch the Word for knowledge,\nIs to take the very way,\nBy which Eve was lured by Satan,\nAnd by knowledge led astray;\nBut as life to take the Scripture,\nIs the tree of life to eat;\nThus the Word we must be taking,\nIn the spirit as our meat."]
