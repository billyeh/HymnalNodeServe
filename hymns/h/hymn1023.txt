["1 I need Thee, precious Jesus!\nFor I am full of sin;\nMy soul is dark and guilty,\nMy spirit dead within:\nI need the cleansing fountain,\nWhere I can always flee:\nThe blood of Christ most precious,\nThe sinner's perfect plea.", "2 I need Thee, precious Jesus!\nFor I am very poor;\nA stranger and a pilgrim,\nI have no earthly store:\nI need the love of Jesus,\nTo cheer me on my way,\nTo guide my doubting footsteps,\nTo be my strength and stay.", "3 I need Thee, precious Jesus!\nI need a friend like Thee;\nA friend to soothe and comfort,\nA friend to care for me:\nI need the heart of Jesus,\nTo feel each anxious care,\nTo bear my every burden,\nAnd all my sorrow share.", "4 I need Thee, precious Jesus!\nI need Thee day by day,\nTo fill me with Thy fulness,\nTo lead me on my way;\nI need Thy Holy Spirit,\nTo teach me what I am;\nTo show me more of Jesus,\nTo point me to the Lamb.", "5 I need Thee, precious Jesus!\nAnd hope to see Thee soon,\nEncircled with Thy glory,\nAnd seated on Thy throne;\nThere with Thy blood-bought people,\nMy joy shall ever be\nTo praise Thee, precious Jesus,\nTo gaze, my Lord, on Thee."]
