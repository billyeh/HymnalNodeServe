["1 Once far from God and dead in sin,\nNo light my heart could see;\nBut in God's Word the light I found,\nNow Christ liveth in me.", "chorus Christ liveth in me,\nChrist liveth in me;\nOh! what a salvation this,\nThat Christ liveth in me.", "2 As rays of light from yonder sun,\nThe flow'rs of earth set free,\nSo life and light and love come forth\nFrom Christ living in me.", "3 As lives the flow'r within the seed,\nAs in the cone the tree,\nSo, praise the Christ of truth and grace,\nHis Spirit dwelleth in me.", "4 With longing all my heart is filled,\nThat like Him I may be,\nAs on the wondrous thought I dwell\nThat Christ liveth in me."]
