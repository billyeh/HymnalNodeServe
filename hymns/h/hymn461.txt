["1 Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,\nWhere the flowers are blooming and the sweet waters flow;\nEverywhere He leads me I would follow, follow on,\nWalking in His footsteps till the crown be won.", "chorus Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!\nAnywhere, everywhere, I would follow on!\nFollow! follow! I would follow Jesus!\nEverywhere He leads me I would follow on!", "2 Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,\nWhere the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow;\nWith His hand to lead me I will never, never fear,\nDangers cannot fright me if my Lord is near.", "3 Down in the valley, or upon the mountain steep,\nClose beside my Savior would my heart ever keep;\nHe will lead me safely in the path that He has trod,\nUp to where they gather in the rest of God."]
