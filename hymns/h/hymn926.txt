["1 Send Thou, O Lord, to every place\nSwift messengers before Thy face,\nThe heralds of Thy wondrous grace,\nWhere Thou Thyself wilt come.", "2 Send men whose eyes have seen the King!\nMen in whose ears His sweet words ring;\nSend such Thy lost ones home to bring;\nSend them where Thou wilt come.", "3 To bring good news to souls in sin;\nThe bruised and broken hearts to win;\nIn every place to bring them in,\nWhere Thou Thyself wilt come.", "4 Gird each one with the Spirit's sword,\nThe sword of Thine own deathless word;\nAnd make them conquerors, conquering Lord,\nWhere Thou Thyself wilt come.", "5 Raise up, O Lord the Holy Ghost,\nFrom this broad land a mighty host,\nTheir war-cry, We will seek the lost,\nWhere Thou, O Christ, wilt come!"]
