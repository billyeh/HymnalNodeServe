["1 All things are possible to him\nThat can in Jesus' name believe;\nLord, I no more Thy name blaspheme,\nThy truth I lovingly receive.\nI can, I do believe in Thee;\nAll things are possible to me.", "2 'Twas most impossible of all\nThat here sin's reign in me should cease;\nYet shall it be, I know it shall;\nJesus, I trust Thy faithfulness.\nIf nothing is too hard for Thee,\nAll things are possible to me.", "3 Though earth and hell the Word gainsay,\nThe Word of God shall never fail;\nThe Lord can break sin's iron sway;\n'Tis certain, though impossible.\nThe thing impossible shall be,\nAll things are possible to me.", "4 All things are possible to God;\nTo Christ, the power of God in man;\nTo me when I am all renewed,\nIn Christ am fully formed again,\nAnd from the reign of sin set free,\nAll things are possible to me.", "5 All things are possible to God;\nTo Christ, the power of God in me;\nNow shed Thy mighty Self abroad,\nLet me no longer live, but Thee;\nGive me this hour in Thee to prove\nThe sweet omnipotence of love."]
