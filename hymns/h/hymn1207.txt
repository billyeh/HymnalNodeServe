["1 There's a way before us and a race to run-\nChrist our way, Christ our way!\nTurn away from everything distracting us-\nRun the race, run the race!\nFrom the altar through the Holy Place,\nThrough the veil into our God,\nTo the law of life within the ark;\n'Tis the goal, our great reward.", "2 There's a cloud of witnesses surrounding us,\nUrging us, forward come!\nThere is Abel, Enoch, Jacob, Abraham,\nMoses, David, Solomon.\nJohn the Baptist greater than them all,\nEven he bids forward come!\nThese all died in faith, receiving not\nPromises that were to come.", "3 The Old Testament believers give the call,\n\"Forward come, forward come!\"\nFor complete perfection they depend on us\nGoing on! Going on!\nWe are at the consummation now\nOf our God's economy;\nBetter things we are experiencing.\nPraise the Lord-reality!", "4 E'en the least of us is greater than their great.\nWe're not small, we're not small!\nThey are waiting, watching, and expecting us.\n\"Forward come!\" hear their call!\nThey have run the race and for their sakes\nWe'll obey the law of life.\nTill the day we'll all be joined in one\nTo express God's glorious Christ."]
