["1 By the cross discern the spirit\nPut the soul to death alway;\nBear the cross, deny the self-life\nWalk in spirit day by day.", "2 By the cross discern the spirit\nThrough the living Word of God\nSeparating soul from spirit\nThat the right path may be trod.", "3 By the cross discern the spirit\nWith the mind by light renewed\nAll emotion consecrated\nAnd the will in love subdued.", "4 By the cross discern the spirit;\nPassing thru the riven veil\nFlesh and soul are wholly broken\nAnd the spirit doth prevail.", "5 By the cross discern the spirit\n'Tis the holiest place divine;\nThere commune with God in spirit,\nAnd His presence will be thine.", "6 By the cross discern the spirit,\nAnd the Jordan River cross;\nEnter then the Land of Canaan\nAnd enjoy Christ thru the cross.", "7 By the cross discern the spirit,\nAnd within the spirit move;\nAs good land, on Christ e'er labor\nAnd His riches thou wilt prove."]
