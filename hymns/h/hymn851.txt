["1 How lovely is Thy dwelling-place!\nWithin Thy courts I long to be;\nThy presence, Lord, my spirit craves\nFor this my heart cries out to Thee.", "2 At Thy burnt-offering altar, Lord\nAnd at Thine incense altar blest\nEven the sparrow finds a home\nAnd swallow there prepares her nest.", "3 Men, as the sparrow, frail and small\nWhen living in Thy house find rest\nRelying on the altar's blood\nEnjoying there the incense blest.", "4 How blessed are those men indeed!\nTrusting in Thee they are made strong;\nHighways to Zion in their hearts\nThe way they care not, rough or long.", "5 Passing the weeping valley they,\nMake it a place of springing wells;\nThe rain with blessings covers it,\nAnd in the way God's mercy tells.", "6 From strength to strength they go, and all,\nBefore the Lord in Zion meet;\nThus ever seeking Thine own self\nThey need Thy care and grace replete.", "7 Better a day within Thy courts,\nThan days a thousand I would tell;\nI'd rather at Thy threshold stand,\nThan in the wicked's tents to dwell.", "8 Thou art a sun, Thou art a shield\nThou grace and glory wilt supply;\nThy presence and Thy very self,\nMy need in fulness satisfy.", "9 Not one good thing wilt Thou withhold,\nFrom those who walk in uprightness;\nBless'd is the man that trusts in Thee,\nWith grace and glory measureless."]
