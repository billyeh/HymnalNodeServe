["1 O Jesus Lord, when present at Thy table,\nAnd on the bread and on the wine we gaze,\nWe praise Thee, Lord, that Thou as food art able\nTo be enjoyed by man in many ways.", "chorus So all our being sings in praise to Thee,\nHow small Thou art, how small Thou art!\nAnd Thee we'll eat through all eternity;\nHow small Thou art, how small Thou art!", "2 O what a shame - when Christ with all His riches,\nHas come into the world, life to supply -\nThat man would live, not by Him but by teachings,\nSo powerless these riches to apply.", "chorus But all we need to do is eat the Lord;\nHe's marvelous, He's wonderful!\nAnd as we eat, we're inwardly restored;\nChrist grows in us, grows to the full.", "3 O Jesus Christ, Thou camest not to mankind\nTo be a king, to rule us outwardly.\nBut Thou hast come as food to satisfy us,\nAnd by Thy life to guide us inwardly.", "chorus (First chorus)", "4 We praise Thee, Lord, for all Thy glorious grandeur,\nFor all Thy strength and majesty replete;\nAnd yet, O Lord, what special thanks we give Thee,\nThat all Thou art is small enough to eat.", "chorus (First chorus)"]
