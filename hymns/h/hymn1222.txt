["1 Sing aloud your praises to the Lord of all,\nNow He is dwelling in Jerusalem.\nTell among us all His doings great and small,\nHis throne, the heavens, yet He walks with men.\nOh, the salvation out of Zion comes;\nHe brought us back from our captivity.\nNow we rejoice and are exceeding glad;\nNow we rejoice and are exceeding glad!", "2 In the Holy City with His own He dwells;\nO Lord, our Lord, how excellent Thy name!\nHe's enthroned upon the praises of His saints;\nAll His delight in Zion does remain.\nThe local churches are His move today-\nHe is our portion, we are satisfied.\nOh, what a goodly heritage have we;\nOh, what a goodly heritage have we!", "3 Who shall in His holy tabernacle dwell,\nWho shall ascend to His most holy hill?\nThose who seek for Him and purify their heart;\nThis generation now that seeks His face.\nOh, seek His face, ye children of the earth,\nOpen your heart, and let the King come in.\nHe will come in, and He shall live and reign;\nHe will come in, and He shall live and reign!", "4 Look! God's tabernacle now is with the saints;\nEmmanuel-God with us, we proclaim.\nEverything is done, so let His children come;\nChrist and the church-where God and man are one!\nLift up your heads, ye cities of the earth;\nOpen your gates, and let the King come in.\nShout to His praise-He's coming in to reign!\nShout to His praise-He's coming in to reign!"]
