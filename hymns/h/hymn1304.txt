["1 Christ comes quickly for His Bride,\nWedding feast He will provide,\nGarments bright and pure supplied-\nDress in time!\nTaking Christ as life she's dressed,\nBy much suffering stitched and pressed;\nRighteous acts are thus possessed-\nDress in time!", "chorus Be in time! Be in time!\nFor the marriage feast of Jesus\nBe in time!\nIf your soul life you deny\nAnd the Spirit you apply,\nThen you'll fully qualify-\nBe in time!", "2 Virgins Christ comes quickly for,\nThose with oil an extra store,\nNot the fools who oil ignore-\nBuy in time!\nFor the oil a price we pay,\nDeal with self without delay,\nFill your vessels every day-\nBuy in time!", "3 For His servants Christ will come\nAnd reward each faithful one;\nSlothful ones will be undone-\nServe in time!\nMake your single talent count,\nAll self's problems now surmount,\nServe with Christ, the living fount-\nServe in time!", "4 Christ comes quickly for His grain,\nRipened firstfruits to obtain;\nUnripe harvest will remain-\nRipen now!\nFrom earth's water grain must dry,\nFrom the world your soul deny;\nTo mature the self must die-\nRipen now!", "5 Overcomers Christ will take,\nThose who all for Him forsake,\nThose who of first love partake-\nWin in time!\nAll the deadness overcome,\nWith the living Christ be one,\nToward the goal now swiftly run-\nWin in time!", "6 Christ comes for His kingdom too;\nHeav'nly reign we must pursue,\nLet His rule our self subdue-\nYield in time!\nRebel self must be dethroned,\nLessons must not be postponed,\nQuickly yield to Christ enthroned-\nYield in time!"]
