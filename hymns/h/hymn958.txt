["1 Since long ago at Bethany we parted\nWithin my heart there is a ceaseless void;\nHow can I take my harp down from the willow?\nHow can my songs without Thee be enjoyed?\nAnd when at night I'm keeping lonely vigil-\nGrown numb alike to sorrow and to cheer-\nThen I recall the promise of Thy coming\nBut sigh: \"O Lord, why, why Thou dost not yet appear?", "2 Thy manger wakes the thought: \"I too am homeless;\nThy cross strips earthly pleasures from my soul;\nThy coming bids me seek a better country\nFor Thou Thyself art now my final goal.\nSince Thou art gone my joy has lost its flavor\nMy song the sweetness I would fain convey.\nSince Thou art gone the sense of void o'erwhelms me.\nOh, how I long that Thou wilt come and not delay.", "3 Though even now I know Thy loving presence\nYet in my heart there's still a sense of lack.\nEnlightening and tenderest sustaining,\nCan no more satisfy: \"I want Thee back.\nDespite Thy peace within, I still feel lonely;\nDespite Thy joy there still remains a sigh;\nWhen I feel most content, the silent yearning,\nTo see Thee face to face becomes an uttered cry.", "4 What exile cannot but desire his homeland,\nAnd long his people once again to greet?\nWhat soul on alien soil forgets his kindred?\nWhat parted lovers never yearn to meet?\nO Lord, how can these earthly loves and pleasures,\nWith all the joy of Thy return compare?\nThen, if I cannot here behold Thy countenance\nWhat can I do but sigh till Thou, my Lord, appear?", "5 Could'st Thou, O Lord, forget Thy word of promise,\nSoon to return and take me unto Thee?\nYet day by day and year by year I've waited,\nAnd still I wait, and no return I see!\nRemember, Lord, the years I have been waiting,\nWhile Thy dear footsteps linger far away.\nHow long? How long? Oh! must I wait still longer,\nTill Thou shalt come again in glorious array?", "6 From generation unto generation,\nThy saints have come and gone, but have not seen,\nThy glorious promise pass into fulfilment.\nHow long, how very long the time has been!\nWhy cannot we, dear Lord, discern Thy footsteps?\nWhy are the heavens still so closely sealed?\nOh! must our waiting be prolonged still further,\nBefore Thou in Thy matchless splendor art revealed?", "7 Lord, I recall the many years I've waited,\nFor Thy return-yet, Lord, not I alone\nBut Thy dear saints through many generations-\nBeseeching Thee to come back for Thine own.\nTo countless tears and countless fervent pleadings\nBy Thine appearing haste to make reply.\nOh, may Thou come, the echo of the ages\nCome, come and answer now this mighty corp'rate cry!"]
