["1 Lord of all being, throned afar,\nThy glory flames from sun and star;\nCenter and light of every sphere,\nYet to each loving heart how near.", "2 Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray\nSheds on our path the glow of day;\nStar of our hope, Thy softened light\nCheers the long watches of the night.", "3 Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn,\nOur noontide is Thy gracious dawn,\nOur rainbow arch Thy mercy's sign;\nAll, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.", "4 Lord of all life, below, above,\nWhose light is truth, whose warmth is love,\nBefore Thy ever-blazing throne\nWe ask no luster of our own.", "5 Grant us Thy truth to make us free,\nAnd kindling hearts that burn for Thee,\nTill all Thy living altars claim\nOne holy light, one heavenly flame."]
