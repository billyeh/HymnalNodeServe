["1 Eternity! Eternity!\nHow will you spend Eternity?\nThis question comes to you and me!\nHow will you spend Eternity?\nTell me, what shall your answer be-\nHow will you spend Eternity?", "2 Eternity! Eternity!\nHow will you spend Eternity?\nMany are choosing Christ today,\nTurning from all their sins away;\nChrist shall their blessed portion be:\nHow will you spend Eternity?", "3 Eternity! Eternity!\nHow will you spend Eternity?\nLeaving the strait and narrow way,\nGoing the downward road today,\nWhat shall the final ending be-\nHow will you spend Eternity?", "4 Eternity! Eternity!\nHow will you spend Eternity?\nTurn, and believe this very hour,\nTrust in the Savior's grace and power:\nThen shall your joyous answer be,\nSaved through a long Eternity!"]
