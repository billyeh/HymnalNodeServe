["1 Gathered at Thy table, Lord;\nHere the bread and wine are spread.\nThou, our High Priest, present here;\nWe, by Thee, are richly fed.\nThou, Lord, our Melchisedec-\nWe, the ones You come to feed;\nGod to us to minister,\nRich supply to us indeed.", "2 From the slaughter of the kings\nAbram did return one night,\nO'er the foe victorious,\nWith the spoils of the fight.\nOn the way this One he met,\nWho for him did intercede;\nKing of Righteousness and Peace\nMeeting Abram in his need.", "3 We too, Lord, the kings have fought\nIn the battle all day long;\nBy Thine intercession, Lord,\nWe are now victorious, strong.\nRound this table here we meet,\nWe Thy church victorious,\nTo enjoy the ministering\nOf the processed God to us.", "4 We're not sinners, miserable;\nAll our sins are history!\nNow to us, the fighters true,\nIs Thy priestly ministry.\nGathered in thanksgiving, Lord,\nNow our hearts to Thee we raise;\nTo our great Melchisedec,\nRender we our highest praise!"]
