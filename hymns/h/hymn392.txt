["1 Jesus, Savior, pilot me\nOver life's tempestuous sea;\nUnknown waves before me roll,\nHiding rock and treach'rous shoal;\nChart and compass come from Thee;\nJesus, Savior, pilot me.", "2 As a mother stills her child,\nThou canst hush the ocean wild;\nBoist'rous waves obey Thy will\nWhen Thou say'st to them, \"Be still.\"\nWondrous Sov'reign of the sea,\nJesus, Savior, pilot me.", "3 Though death's valley I may pass,\nStill Thy grace will fear surpass;\nIn Thy presence I will rest,\nAnd, while leaning on Thy breast,\nI will hear Thee say to me,\n\"Fear not, I will pilot thee.\""]
