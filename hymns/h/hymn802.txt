["1 Thou art the Word and Spirit, Lord;\nNow in one spirit worship we;\n'Tis by the Word we understand\nAnd in the Spirit contact Thee.", "2 Since Thou with me hast joined in one\nThou art my all, O Lord, thereby;\nAnd as the Spirit and the Word,\nThou cam'st to me as my supply.", "3 If Thou art Lord, yet not the Word\nHow couldest Thou be known to me?\nIf Thou art God yet Spirit not\nHow could I ever contact Thee?", "4 The Word reveals Thyself to me,\nAnd knowledge of Thyself imparts;\nThe Spirit is Thy substance true,\nWhereby I touch Thee as Thou art.", "5 Thou art my life, my light, my way\nMy food, my strength and guaranty;\nBy Word made known, as Spirit these,\nBecome experience to me.", "6 Thy Word in Scripture is expressed\nThy Spirit, the Indwelling One;\nThy Word is spirit and is life,\nWhen to my spirit it doth come.", "7 If I Thy Word would understand\nI must Thy Holy Spirit touch;\nNot only grasp it with my mind\nBut with my spirit, praying much.", "8 Thy precious Word my heart doth love\nMy spirit fellowships with Thine;\nMy heart rejoices in Thy Word\nMy spirit praises sings in Thine."]
