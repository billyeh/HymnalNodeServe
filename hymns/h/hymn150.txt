["1 Praise, praise ye the name of our Savior and God;\nDeclare, oh, declare ye His glories abroad;\nProclaim ye His mercy, from nation to nation,\nTill the uttermost islands have heard His salvation.", "chorus For His love floweth on, free and full as a river;\nAnd His mercy endureth forever and ever.", "2 Praise, praise ye the Lamb, who for sinners was slain;\nWho went down to the grave, and ascended again;\nAnd who soon shall return, when these dark days are o'er,\nTo set up His kingdom, in glory and power.", "3 Then the heav'ns and the earth, and the sea shall rejoice;\nThe field and the forest shall lift their glad voice;\nThe sands of the desert shall flourish in green,\nAnd Lebanon's glory be shed o'er the scene.", "4 Her bridal attire, and her festal array,\nAll nature shall see on that glorious day;\nFor her King cometh down with His people to reign,\nAnd His presence shall bless her with glory in men."]
