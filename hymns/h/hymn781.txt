["1 Exercise the spirit,\nPray in every way!\nI have prayed too little,\nKeen my spirit, nay.\nEven when I prayed, my\nSpirit seldom proved\nEver just to follow\nAs Thy Spirit moved.", "2 Now I'd pray in spirit\nAs Thy Spirit groans;\nPray by the anointing,\nNot as memory owns.\nNot the mind applying\nBut with spirit pray,\nPraising or beseeching\nSpirit-led alway.", "3 Not just by myself my\nSpirit exercise,\nBut with others' praying\nI would do likewise;\nPraying in the spirit,\nAs the spirit wants,\nFor 'tis in the inmost\nSpirits have response.", "4 When we serve together,\nWe thru prayer would move,\nFellowship in spirit,\nNot in word to prove.\nNever pray together,\nShouting, crying much,\nYet the fellowship in\nSpirit never touch.", "5 Exercise the spirit\nHere and everywhere,\nFew or many present,\nCaring not who's there.\nNot a place or person\nWill influence me,\nIn all kinds of meetings\nI'll my spirit free.", "6 Thus my spirit lifted\nGives the Lord His way;\nThus, my spirit strengthened,\nI'll be used each day.\nIn the spirit's flowing\nLiving water see;\nThus the saints are mingled,\nBuilt the church will be."]
