["1 To the Lord we're as a garden,\nOut from which the spices flow;\nAll the precious fruits of Jesus\nFreely in this garden grow.\nSpikenard, saffron, henna flower,\nCinnamon and calamus,\nFrankincense and myrrh and aloes;\nO Lord, we would ever grow Thee thus.", "2 O Lord, come into Thy garden,\nCome, Beloved, come and eat\nFreely for Thy satisfaction\nOf Thy fruit, abundant, sweet.\n\"Yea,\" Thou answerest, \"I am eating\nHoneycomb with honey pure.\"\nAll sweet spices from Thy garden,\nDoth Thy satisfaction, Lord, secure.", "3 All the produce of the garden\nIs with resurrection filled\nThat the Lord may have a city,\nFruits of resurrection build.\nFrom the garden to the city,\nGrowth transformed to precious stone;\nChrist is thus expressed, reflected-\nGod in all His glory fully shown.", "4 Now the city, fair and comely,\nAs the dawn, triumphantly,\nIs an army strong and mighty\nMarching forth in victory.\nLo, the city and the army-\nSaints transformed in one accord.\nWhat a terror to the devil,\nAnd so beautiful unto the Lord!"]
