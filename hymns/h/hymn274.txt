["1 O Lord, we seek the power we need;\nWe are so weak in word and in deed,\nAnd in Thy service cannot proceed\nClothe us with pow'r we pray!", "chorus We are waiting, and to Thee we bow\nIn Thy presence all our need avow;\nGive us Thy power, give even now\nClothe us with pow'r today.", "2 Lord, come and visit us at this place\nGrant to Thy Church the gifts of Thy grace\nFully with might our service embrace\nClothe us with pow'r we pray!", "3 Send us Thy power with its full sway\nAs Thou didst send on Pentecost day;\nAnswer our prayer and make no delay\nClothe us with pow'r we pray!", "4 Here, as Thy Body, Thy pow'r we claim;\nClaiming by faith in Thy mighty Name\nThy heav'nly show'r with Thy heav'nly flame;\nClothe us with pow'r we pray!"]
