["1 I am so glad that our Father in heav'n\nTells of His love in the Book He has giv'n;\nWonderful things in the Bible I see:\nThis is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.", "chorus I am so glad that Jesus loves me,\nJesus loves me, Jesus loves me;\nI am so glad that Jesus loves me,\nJesus loves even me.", "2 Though I forget Him and wander away,\nStill He doth love me whenever I stray;\nBack to His dear loving arms would I flee,\nWhen I remember that Jesus loves me.", "3 Oh, if there's only one song I can sing,\nWhen in His beauty I see the great King,\nThis shall my song in eternity be:\n\"Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me.\""]
