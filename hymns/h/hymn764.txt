["1 Lord, in Thy presence silent I would be\nThat in the inmost I to Thee may come;\nI would not in my own way pray to Thee\nBut let Thy prayer in me my prayer become.", "2 It seems Thou art in heaven hearing me\nBut right within my spirit Thou dost dwell;\nIt seems that I am praying unto Thee\nBut really from Thyself the prayers do well.", "3 When, Lord, no words my burden can express\nMy spirit with Thy Spirit deeply groans;\nNot verbally I then my plea address\nBut Thou dost pray within with words unknown.", "4 I would inhale Thee, Lord, e'en as I breathe\nAnd eat and drink Thee as my life supply.\nA deeper fellowship with Thee bequeath,\nThat Thou express Thyself through me thereby.", "5 Here in this fellowship Thy light doth shine\nThy precious blood doth cleanse and make me clean;\nMay I not only, Lord, Thy light enshrine\nBut may Thou be expressed and clearly seen.", "6 Thy oil anoints me here in every way\nAnointing Thee within unceasingly;\nI more decrease, Thou more increase each day\nThus full expression Thou shalt have through me.", "7 Myself I open that Thou may flow in;\nOp'ning myself to others, Lord, flow out;\nBy such a stream, the fellowship within\nThou, Lord, expressed will be my life throughout."]
