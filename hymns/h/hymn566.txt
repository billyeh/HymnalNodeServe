["1 Oh, safe to the Rock that is higher than I,\nMy soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly,\nSo sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine would I be,\nThou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in Thee.", "chorus Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,\nThou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in Thee.", "2 In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow's lone hour,\nIn times when temptation casts o'er me its power;\nIn the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,\nThou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in Thee.", "3 How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,\nI have fled to my Refuge and breathed out my woe,,\nHow often, when trials like sea-billows roll,\nHave I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul."]
