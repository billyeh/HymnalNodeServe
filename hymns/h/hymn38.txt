["1 Of all the gifts Thy love bestows,\nThou Giver of all good.\nE'en heav'n itself no richer knows\nThan Jesus and His blood.", "2 Faith, too, that trusts in Him through grace,\nFrom that same love we gain;\nElse, sweetly as it suits our case,\nThe gift had been in vain.", "3 We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more,\nTo Thee our all we owe:\nThe precious Savior, and the power\nThat makes Him precious too."]
