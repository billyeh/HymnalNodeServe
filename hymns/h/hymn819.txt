["1 As the body is the fulness,\nTo express our life\nSo to Christ the Church, His Body\nDoth express His life.", "2 E'en as Eve is part of Adam,\nTaken out of him\nSo the Church is Christ's own increase,\nWith Himself within.", "3 As from out the buried kernel,\nMany grains are formed\nAs the grains together blended,\nTo a loaf are formed;", "4 So the Church, of many Christians\nChrist doth multiply\nHim expressing as one Body\nGod to glorify.", "5 As the branches of the grapevine,\nAre its outward spread\nWith it one, abiding, bearing,\nClusters in its stead;", "6 So the Church's many members,\nChrist's enlargement are\nOne with Him in life and living\nSpreading Him afar.", "7 Fulness, increase, duplication\nHis expression full\nGrowth and spread, continuation\nSurplus plentiful", "8 Is the Church to Christ, and thereby,\nGod in Christ may be,\nGlorified thru His redeemed ones,\nTo eternity.", "9 Thus the Church and Christ together\nGod's great mystery\nIs the mingling of the Godhead,\nWith humanity."]
