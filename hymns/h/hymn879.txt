["1 Christian, dost thou see them\nOn the holy ground,\nHow the powers of darkness\nCompass thee around?\nChristian, up and smite them,\nCounting gain but loss;\nSmite them by the merit\nOf the holy cross.", "2 Christian, dost thou feel them,\nHow they work within,\nStriving, tempting, luring,\nGoading into sin?\nChristian, never tremble,\nNever be downcast;\nGird thee for the conflict;\nWatch, and pray, and fast.", "3 Christian, dost thou hear them,\nHow they speak thee fair?\n\"Always fast and vigil,\nAlways watch and prayer?\"\nChristian, answer boldly,\n\"While I breathe I pray\";\nPeace shall follow battle,\nNight shall end in day."]
