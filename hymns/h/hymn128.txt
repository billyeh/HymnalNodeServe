["1 Far above all is our Savior enthroned;\nCrown'd is the Lamb who by sinners is owned,\nLiving forever to list to our call,\nGod hath exalted Him far above all.", "chorus Far above all! Far above all!\nJesus the crucified far above all!\nHigh as His members upon Him we call,\nGod hath exalted Him far above all!", "2 When the fierce tempest, uplifting its waves,\nSeeks to engulf us, we cry and He saves;\nLooking to Jesus, upheld by His hand,\nTread we the billows as safe as on land.", "3 High are the cities that dare our assault,\nStrong are the barriers that call us to halt;\nMarch we on fearless, and down they must fall,\nVanquish'd by faith in Him far above all.", "4 His is the kingdom from pole unto pole,\nFar above all while the ages shall roll,\nWith Him the victors, who follow'd His call,\nShare in His royalty far above all."]
