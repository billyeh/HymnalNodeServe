["1 I have a Savior, He's pleading in glory,\nA dear loving Savior, though earth-friends be few;\nAnd now He is watching in tenderness o'er me,\nBut oh, that my Savior were your Savior too!", "chorus For you I am praying,\nFor you I am praying,\nFor you I am praying,\nI'm praying for you.", "2 I have a Father: \"to me He has given\nA hope for eternity, blessed and true;\nHe'll call me one day to the kingdom of heaven,\nBut oh, that He'd let me bring you with me too!", "3 I have a peace: \"it is calm as a river,\nA peace that the friends of this world never knew;\nMy Savior alone is its Author and Giver,\nAnd oh, could I know it was given to you!"]
