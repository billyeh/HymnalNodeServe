["1 Changed into His likeness!\nThis my heart's desire!\nMay the Lord fulfill it\nAll my soul inspire.", "2 Changed into His likeness!\nHe the Spirit is!\nIf the Spirit governs\nHe'll fulfill my wish.", "3 As a glass, beholding,\nWith uncovered face\nI can see His glory,\nAnd reflect His grace.", "4 O that no more covering,\nMay the Lord obscure\nThat I may reflect Him,\nWith a heart made pure.", "5 Gazing on His glory\nFace to face to see;\nConstantly beholding\nEver would I be.", "6 Changed into His likeness!\nThis my heart's one quest!\nFrom my heart reflected\nHe will be expressed.", "7 Changed into His likeness,\nAnd reflecting more,\nGlory unto glory\nBoundless evermore."]
