["1 Lord, Thou wilt soon appear,\nThy day is almost here.\nOh, how we love Thy coming soon!\nWe have no other\nLord, life, or lover\nThan Thou, Lord Jesus, our Bridegroom!", "2 The hour is drawing nigh,\nSoon we shall hear Thy cry\nAnd with Thee on the clouds descend.\nOh what an hour sweet\nWhen Bride and Bridegroom meet\nAnd love surpassing comprehend.", "3 The moments fly apace,\nSoon we shall see Thy face!\nAmen, Lord Jesus! Quickly come!\nWe long Thyself to see\nAnd with Thee ever be,\nThou who our inmost heart hath won.", "4 'Tis but a moment now;\nThou, our Lord Bridegroom, Thou\nSoon wilt return to claim Thy Bride.\nO Hallelujah!\n'Tis this we long for,\nAnd Thou too wilt be satisfied."]
