["1 Will your anchor hold in the storms of life,\nWhen the clouds unfold their wings of strife?\nWhen the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,\nWill your anchor drift or firm remain?", "chorus We have an anchor that keeps the soul\nStedfast and sure while the billows roll,\nFastened to the Rock which cannot move,\nGrounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.", "2 It is safely moored, 'twill the storm withstand,\nFor 'tis well secured by the Savior's hand;\nAnd the cables passed from His heart to mine,\nCan defy the blast, through strength divine.", "3 It will firmly hold in the straits of fear,\nWhen the breakers have told the reef is near;\nThough the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,\nNot an angry wave shall our bark o'erflow.", "4 It will surely hold in the floods of death,\nWhen the waters cold chill our latest breath;\nOn the rising tide it can never fail,\nWhile our hopes abide within the veil."]
