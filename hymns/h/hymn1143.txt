["1 The tree of life, how sweet the fruit,\nWith God as life complete.\nI once was dead, but now I live,\nWas starved, but now I eat.", "2 'Twas God that brought me to the tree,\nWith Christ Himself as meat;\nHow precious did that tree become\nWhen I began to eat.", "3 The Lord Himself is food to me,\nHe is my life supply;\nHe will my pure enjoyment be,\nNone else can satisfy.", "4 I freely eat this living tree,\nFor eating is the way\nTo put God's life inside of me,\nTo live by Him today."]
