["1 Jesus, Fountain of my days,\nWell-spring of my heart's delight,\nBrightness of my morning rays,\nSolace of my hours of night;\nWhen I see Thee, I arise\nTo the hope of cloudless skies.", "2 Oh, how weary were the years\nEre Thy form to me was known;\nOh, how gloomy were the fears\nWhen I seemed to be alone;\nI despaired the storm to brave\nTill Thy footprints touched the wave.", "3 But Thy presence on the deep\nCalmed the pulses of the sea,\nAnd the waters sank to sleep\nIn the rest of seeing Thee;\nAnd my once rebellious will\nHeard the mandate, Peace, be still!", "4 Now Thy will and mine are one,\nHeart in heart, and hand in hand;\nAll the clouds have touched the sun,\nAnd the ships have reached the land;\nFor Thy love has said to me,\nNo more night! and No more sea!"]
