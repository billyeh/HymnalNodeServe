["1 Remove my covering, Lord\nThat I may see Thy light\nAnd be deceived no more\nBut all things see aright.", "chorus Oh, may Thy living light, Lord\nScatter all my night, Lord\nAnd everything make bright, Lord\nFor this I pray to Thee.", "2 I hardly know myself;\nDeceived so much by pride\nI often think I'm right,\nAnd am self-satisfied.", "3 I know Thee even less;\nIn doctrine, shallowly;\nTrue revelation lack,\nOf Thy reality.", "4 As for Thy life within\nIn darkness I mistake-\nIf spirit or the flesh\nOne for the other take.", "5 As for Thy way, O Lord\nI often am not clear;\nI toward seclusion tend,\nAnd from the pathway veer.", "6 As for Thy will for me\nI do not know it well;\nI substitute my own,\nAnd often would rebel.", "7 As for the church, I need,\nThy revelation more\nThe Body-life to know\nThy wisdom to explore.", "8 I long to be unveiled\nIn everything made clear\nNo more to be deceived,\nOr to my pride adhere."]
