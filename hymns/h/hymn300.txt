["1 Arise, my soul, arise!\nShake off thy guilty fears;\nThe bleeding Sacrifice\nIn my behalf appears.\nBefore the throne my Surety stands;\nMy name is written on His hands.", "2 He ever lives above\nFor me to intercede,\nHis all-redeeming love,\nHis precious blood to plead.\nHis blood was shed for all our race,\nAnd sprinkles now the throne of grace.", "3 Five bleeding wounds He bears,\nReceived on Calvary;\nThey pour effectual prayers;\nThey strongly speak for me.\nForgive him, O forgive, they cry,\nNor let that ransomed sinner die!", "4 The Father hears Him pray,\nHis dear anointed One;\nHe cannot turn away\nThe presence of His Son.\nHis Spirit answers to the blood,\nAnd tells me I am born of God.", "5 To God I'm reconciled,\nHis pardoning voice I hear;\nHe owns me for His child,\nI can no longer fear.\nWith confidence I now draw nigh,\nAnd Father, Abba, Father, cry."]
