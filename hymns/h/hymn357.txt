["1 Come, Jesus, Lord, with holy fire,\nCome, and my quickened heart inspire,\nMy conscience purged by blood;\nNow to my soul Thyself reveal,\nThy mighty working let me feel,\nSince I am born of God.", "2 Let nothing now my heart divide,\nSince with Thee I am crucified,\nAnd live to God in Thee.\nDead to the world and all its toys,\nIts idle pomp and fading joys,\nJesus, my glory be.", "3 Now with a quenchless thirst inspire,\nA longing, infinite desire,\nAnd fill my craving heart.\nLess than Thyself, oh, do not give,\nIn might Thyself within me live;\nCome, all Thou hast and art.", "4 My will be swallowed up in Thee,\nLight in Thy light still may I see\nIn Thine unclouded face:\nCalled the full strength of trust to prove,\nLet all my quickened heart be love,\nMy spotless life be praise."]
