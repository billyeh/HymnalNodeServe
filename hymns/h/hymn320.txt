["1 In loving-kindness Jesus came\nMy soul in mercy to reclaim,\nAnd from the depths of sin and shame\nThrough grace He lifted me.", "chorus From sinking sand He lifted me,\nWith tender hand He lifted me,\nFrom shades of night to plains of light,\nOh, praise His name, He lifted me!", "2 He called me long before I heard,\nBefore my sinful heart was stirred,\nBut when I took Him at His word,\nForgiv'n, He lifted me.", "3 His brow was pierced with many a thorn,\nHis hands by cruel nails were torn,\nWhen from my guilt and grief, forlorn,\nIn love He lifted me.", "4 Now on a higher plane I dwell,\nAnd with my soul I know 'tis well;\nYet how or why, I cannot tell,\nHe should have lifted me."]
