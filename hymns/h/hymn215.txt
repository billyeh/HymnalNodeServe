["1 Jesus, Lord, we know Thee present\nAt Thy table freshly spread,\nSeated at Thy priceless banquet\nWith Thy banner overhead.\nPrecious moments at Thy table,\nFrom all fear and doubt set free;\nHere to rest, so sweetly able,\nOccupied alone with Thee.", "2 Here rejoicing in Thy nearness,\nGladly by Thy Spirit led;\nCalmly in the blest remembrance\nOf Thyself, Thy blood once shed.\nLord, we take each simple token\nIn fond memory of Thee,\nMuse upon Thy body broken\nAnd Thy blood shed on the tree.", "3 Oh, what joy it is to see Thee,\nIn these chosen emblems here;\nIn the bread and wine of blessing-\nBread to strengthen, wine to cheer!\nLord, behold us met together,\nOne in Thee, our risen Head,\nThus we take the cup of blessing,\nThus we share the broken bread.", "4 Lord, we know how true Thy promise\nTo be with us where we meet,\nWhen in Thy loved name we gather\nTo enjoy communion sweet;\nDearer still that looked-for promise\nTo each waiting, yearning heart,\nThat with Thee we soon shall be, Lord,\nYes, \"forever\" where Thou art."]
