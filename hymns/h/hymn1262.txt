["1 It's by our mingled spirit, Lord,\nThat we can shine with Thee,\nAnd be a golden lampstand now\nFor all the world to see.\nIt's not by forms or rituals,\nMere Christianity;\nIt's by our Christ enjoyed as life\nWe all can shine with Thee.", "2 The burning Christ has feet as brass\nWhich in the furnace bums,\nHis eyes are as a flame of fire-\n'Tis to this Christ we turn!\nHow could we ever lukewarm be\nWhen on His face we gaze?\nO Lord, we give ourselves to You\nTo set us all ablaze!", "3 The seven golden lampstands in\nThe seven cities see,\nSo burning, shining with this Christ,\nIt's God's economy!\nWe're absolute that this become\nOur full reality\nUpon the earth, within the church\nIn each locality."]
