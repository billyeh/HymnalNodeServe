["1 Oh, listen to the wanderer\nIn whom there was a lack;\nThen hearken to the song he sings\nAnd follow in his track.", "chorus Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,\nPraise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord,\nI'll never be the same!", "2 A wanderer within the world\nFor pleasure ever seeks;\nBe it in body or in mind,\nWith vanity it reeks.", "3 For self I labored day and night,\nMy castles built in sand;\nBut, praise the Lord, He wrecked them all-\nMuch better things He planned.", "4 Once all for self-confused, alone,\nHow could I bear the shame?\nBut now within the local church\nI'll never be the same.", "5 I am a happy member now\nWithin the local church.\nA wanderer has found his home\nAnd ended all his search.", "6 I was an individualist,\nAn island in myself;\nBut now the Lord is building me\nWith others in Himself.", "7 I'm drawn together with His own\nIn fellowship so sweet.\nI've learned from others to receive\nOf Christ whene'er we meet.", "8 My wanderings have really ceased-\nI've found the church, God's best!\nThe secret of my happiness-\nEnjoying God's own rest!"]
