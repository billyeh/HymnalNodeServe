["1 Never further than Thy Cross,\nNever higher than Thy feet,\nHere earth's precious things seem dross,\nHere earth's bitter things grow sweet.", "2 Gazing thus our sin we see,\nLearn Thy love while gazing thus;\nSin which laid the Cross on Thee;\nLove which bore the Cross for us.", "3 Here we learn to serve and give,\nAnd rejoicing, self deny;\nHere we gather love to live;\nHere we gather faith to die.", "4 Symbols of our liberty\nAnd our service here unite;\nCaptives, by Thy Cross set free;\nSoldiers of Thy Cross, we fight.", "5 Pressing onwards as we can,\nStill to this our hearts must tend;\nWhere our earliest hopes began,\nThere our last aspirings end.", "6 Till amid the hosts of light\nWe in Thee redeemed, complete,\nThrough Thy Cross made pure and white,\nCast our crowns before Thy feet."]
