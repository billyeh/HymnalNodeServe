["1 Thy name is sweet as ointment poured forth;\nBetter Thy love than wine, O draw Thou me!\nIf we the footsteps follow of the flock\nEntered Thy fellowship of love we'll be.", "2 He's my Beloved, I am His own love;\nHe draweth me, pursue I after Him.\nFragrant as myrrh, I'd hide Him in my heart;\nBeauteous as henna* I'd be clothed with Him;", "3 Bathe in His love, and of His fatness taste\nLie on His breast, His sweetness there enjoy;\nHis love the banner, His affection shown,\nTenderly soothes my heart to purest joy.", "4 Oh, my Beloved's mine, and I am His;\nI am a lily and my Shepherd He;\nMay daybreak come, the shadows flee away\nHim on the mountains as a hart I'd see.", "5 Myrrh of the death with Him and frankincense\nThe resurrection, permeate my heart;\nNorth wind awake, and let the south wind blow\nMake my heart's garden pleasure to His heart.", "6 I'd be to Him a dove that's undefiled\nAs a pure lily in His presence be\nHis, wholly His, the joy of all His joys\nHe wholly mine, the Song of songs to me.", "7 Fair as the moon, conformed to Him I'd be\nClear as the sun, unto His stature grown;\nFor my Beloved, all to please His heart\nFor my Beloved, that His life be shown.", "8 Thou art my life, and I Thine image real;\nLove in such union is as death most strong\nNe'er can it be destroyed or e'er replaced,\nTill Thou on spices mountains come ere long.\n* Old World plant, prized for its fragrant yellow and,\nwhite flowers.
