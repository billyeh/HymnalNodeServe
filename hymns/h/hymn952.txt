["1 A lamp in the night, a song in time of sorrow,\nA great glad hope which faith can ever borrow\nTo gild the passing day with the glory of the morrow,\nIs the hope of the coming of the Lord.", "chorus Blessed hope, blessed hope,\nBlessed hope of the coming of the Lord;\nHow the aching heart it cheers;\nHow it glistens through our tears,\nBlessed hope of the coming of the Lord.", "2 A star in the sky, a beacon bright to guide us;\nAn anchor sure to hold when storms betide us;\nA refuge for the soul, where in quiet we may hide us,\nIs the hope of the coming of the Lord.", "3 A call of command, like trumpet clearly sounding,\nTo make us bold when evil is surrounding;\nTo stir the sluggish heart, and to keep in goodabounding,\nIs the hope of the coming of the Lord.", "4 A word from the One to all our hearts the dearest,\nA parting word to make Him aye the nearest;\nOf all His precious words, the sweetest, brightest, clearest,\nIs the hope of the coming of the Lord."]
