["1 My heart is resting, O my God,\nI will give thanks and sing;\nMy heart is at the secret source\nOf every precious thing.", "chorus Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,\nI daily, hourly sing;\nMy heart is at the secret source\nOf every precious thing.", "2 Now this frail vessel Thou hast made,\nNo hand but Thine shall fill;\nThe waters of the earth have failed,\nAnd I am thirsty still.", "3 I thirst for springs of heavenly life,\nAnd here all day they rise;\nI seek the treasure of Thy love,\nAnd close at hand it lies.", "4 A glad, new song is in my mouth,\nTo long-loved music set,\nA song of praise for all the grace\nI have not tasted yet.", "5 I have a heritage of joy\nThat yet I must not see;\nThe hand that bled to make it mine\nIs keeping it for me.", "6 There is a certainty of love\nThat sets my heart at rest;\nA calm assurance for today\nThat to be poor is best.", "7 A prayer reposing on His truth,\nWho hath made all things mine;\nThat draws my captive will to Him,\nAnd makes it one with Thine."]
