["1 Christ will make His seeking lover\nPillar, couch, and palanquin,\nE'en a crown, His boast and glory;\nHe will do it all! Amen!", "chorus His beloved-how He loves her,\nSo attractive, His delight.\nHe is captivated wholly;\nShe is comely in His sight.", "2 But there still remains a shadow;\nChrist is still not satisfied.\nHe must have a growing garden\nTo become His loving Bride!", "3 Paradise of pomegranates,\nPleasant fruits, and henna flowers,\nSpikenard, saffron, myrrh, and aloes:\nHis enjoyment now-not ours.", "4 He has come into His garden,\nGathered myrrh and spices there,\nEaten honeycomb and honey;\nWine and milk He'll drink fore'er.", "5 From the garden comes the city,\nAll materials thus supplied;\nGod is satisfied completely,\nAnd the foe is terrified.", "6 \"Thou art fair, my love, as Tirzah,\nComely as Jerusalem.\"\nO Lord Jesus, Hallelujah,\nThou wilt do it all! Amen!"]
