["1 Lord of light, with light divine,\nShine upon this heart of mine;\nChase the shades of night away,\nTurn the darkness into day.", "2 Lord of power, with power divine,\nCleanse this guilty heart of mine;\nLong has sin without control\nHeld dominion o'er my soul.", "3 Lord of joy, with joy divine,\nCheer this saddened heart of mine;\nBid my many woes depart,\nHeal my wounded, bleeding heart.", "4 Lord, the Spirit, all divine,\nDwell within this heart of mine;\nCast down every idol throne,\nReign supreme, and reign alone."]
