["1 O Lord, Thy boundless love to me\nNo thought can reach, no tongue declare;\nOh, knit my thankful heart to Thee,\nAnd reign without a rival there;\nThine wholly, Thine alone I am;\nLord, with Thy love my heart inflame.", "2 Oh, grant that nothing in my soul\nMay dwell but Thy pure love alone;\nOh, may Thy love possess me whole,\nMy joy, my treasure, and my crown;\nAll coldness from my heart remove;\nMay every act, word, thought, be love.", "3 O Love, how cheering is Thy ray,\nAll pain before Thy presence flies;\nCare, anguish, sorrow, melt away,\nWhere'er Thy healing beams arise;\nLord Jesus, nothing may I see,\nAnd naught desire, or seek, but Thee."]
