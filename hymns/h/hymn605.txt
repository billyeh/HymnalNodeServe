["1 My home is God Himself; Christ brought me there,\nAnd bade me dwell in Him, rejoicing there;\nHe bore me where no foot but His hath trod,\nWithin the holiest at home with God.\nO holy place! O home divinely fair!\nAnd we, God's little ones, abiding there.", "2 A long, long road I traveled night and day,\nAnd sought to find within myself some way,\nAught I could do, or feel to bring me near;\nSelf effort failed, and I was filled with fear,\nAnd then I found Christ was the only way\nThat I must come to Him and in Him stay.", "3 O wondrous place! O home divinely fair!\nAnd I, God's little one, safe hidden there.\nLord, as I dwell in Thee and Thou in me,\nSo make me dead to everything but Thee;\nThat as I rest within my home most fair,\nI'll share my God in all and everywhere."]
