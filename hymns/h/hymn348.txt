["1 Since Christ my soul from sin set free,\nThis life has been a joy to me;\nAnd 'mid earth's sorrows and its woe,\n'Tis joy my Jesus here to know.", "chorus O hallelujah, yes, 'tis joy!\nFor it is Christ that I enjoy!\nOn land or sea, what matters where?\nWhere Jesus is, my joy is there.", "2 The earth was once a bitter place\nTill Jesus showed His smiling face;\nNow joy's begun within my soul,\n'Twill last while endless ages roll.", "3 What matters where on earth we dwell?\nOn mountain top, or in the dell,\nIn cottage, or a mansion fair,\nWhere Jesus is, my joy is there."]
