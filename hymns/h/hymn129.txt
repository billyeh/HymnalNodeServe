["1 Behold the Lamb with glory crowned,\nTo Him all pow'r is giv'n:\nNo place too high for Him is found,\nNo place too high in heav'n.", "2 He fills the throne-the throne above;\nIts rights to Him belong;\nThe object of His Father's love,\nTheme of the ransomed's song.", "3 Though high yet He accepts the praise\nHis people offer here;\nThe faintest, feeblest note they raise\nWill reach the Savior's ear.", "4 This song be ours, we join in one\nTo celebrate the Name\nOf Him that sits upon the throne,\nAnd to exalt the Lamb.", "5 To Him whom men despise and slight,\nTo Him be glory giv'n;\nThe crown is His, and His by right\nThe highest place in heav'n."]
