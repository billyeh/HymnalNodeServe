["1 Dear Lord Jesus, we adore Thee\n\"Seed of woman\" Thou became;\nOf the virgin wast begotten\nCalled e'en with a human name.\nTaking thus the human nature\nThou as man the serpent trod;\nBy the Cross his head Thou bruised,\nAnd fulfilled the plan of God.", "chorus Lord, we see Thy glory\nShown in human beauty\nFull of splendor, manifested,\nIn humanity.", "2 As a man, by incarnation\nFlesh and blood didst Thou partake,\nTo destroy the devil, Satan\nIn our stead and for our sake.\nWith the name of Jesus given,\nAnd Emmanuel called too\nThou becam'st our precious Savior\nBringing us salvation true.", "3 Thou, \"Last Adam\" wast entitled\nAnd wast called the \"second man\"\nHead of all the new creation\nBetter than the first man.\nOn this earth in life and conduct,\nThou indeed wast Son of man;\nNow in heaven with this nature,\nThou dost still appear as man.", "4 In the time which God appointed,\nThou wilt come, dear Lord, again\nWith the glory of the Father\nStill appearing as a man.\nEven on the throne of judgment,\nSon of man Thou still wilt be;\nAnd with this, our human nature\nThou forevermore wilt be."]
