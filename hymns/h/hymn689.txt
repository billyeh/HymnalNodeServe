["1 O child of the Kingdom in doubt and distress!\nWhy linger-thy Father is waiting to bless?\nAssured of the mercy and love of thy Lord,\nClaim each precious promise, take God at His Word!", "chorus Take God at His Word,\nTake God at His Word!\nBelieve every promise,\nTake God at His Word!", "2 Thy pathway through sorrows and trials may go,\nThough deep be the waters, they will not o'erflow;\nOh, trust in the Savior, His name be adored!\nConfide in His promise, take God at His Word!", "3 He says He will guide thee through sunshine and gloom;\nHis presence shall brighten thy path to the throne;\nAnd down in death's valley His voice shall be heard:\nFear not, tempted Christian, take God at His Word!", "4 An heir to a kingdom, and promised a crown;\nWith God thy protector-oh, why be cast down?\nOh, think of the triumphs of faith thou hast heard;\nBe not unbelieving, take God at His Word!"]
