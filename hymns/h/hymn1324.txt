["1 Our God is a God of purpose,\nWhat He plans, He will fulfill!\nGenesis to Revelation\nShows His full and glorious will.\nWhat He's after is a building.\nIn creation He began\nWith a simple garden planted-\nThis, the setting for His plan.", "2 Man was made, the first step God took\nTo achieve His final goal,\nAs a vessel, a container,\nThree parts-body, spirit, soul.\nGod, of dust, a body formed him,\nBreath of life into him breathed-\nThis part is man's human spirit\nBy which God may be received.", "3 In the garden God had planted\nEvery tree He made to grow,\nGood for food, to sight most pleasing,\nAnd the tree of life also!\nSecond, then, in God's intention\nWas that man should freely eat\nOf the life-tree in the center\nTo obtain His life complete.", "4 Third, we see a river flowing,\nOut of Eden coming forth,\nWith its flow in four directions-\nEast and west and south and north\nAs on Christ our life we're feeding,\nLiving water in us flows.\nHallelujah for this river\nAnd the watering it bestows!", "5 In the flowing of the river\nGold, pearl, onyx stone we see;\nThree materials, raw yet precious,\nFor God's building meant to be.\nLook, these elements are shining'\nHow can we, then, shine as they?\nSimply by the Lord, the Spirit,\nUs transforming every day.", "6 God the Father (in this fourth step),\nSource of life, is gold divine;\nChrist the Son was wounded by us\nTo produce the pearl so fine.\nGod the Spirit brings the stones forth-\nTransformation of the clay.\nBy the flowing of the Spirit\nChanged we'll be from day to day.", "7 Insufficient are materials\nPrecious though they be and best:\nThese must be built up together\nThat God's house they may express.\nFifth step: \"We ourselves hand over\nTo the building that we be\nBuilt into God's house, His dwelling.\nOne in each locality.", "8 Finally, in Revelation,\nIs the picture of Christ's Bride-\nConsummation of God's purpose;\nHe is fully satisfied.\nNew Jerusalem, a city,\nIs the Bridegroom's counterpart-\nSo the church built up together\nForms the Bride for Christ's own heart.", "9 How can we, as those who truly\nLong to see God reach His goal,\nBe united and related?\nBy denial of our soul!\nAs we contact Christ in spirit,\nFeed on Him as life to us,\nThen His life will flow, transform us\nTo His Bride, all glorious!"]
