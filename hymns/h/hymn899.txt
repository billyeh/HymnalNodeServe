["1 The work is Thine, O Christ our Lord,\nThe cause for which we stand;\nAnd being Thine, 'twill overcome\nIts foes on every hand.\nYet grains of wheat, before they grow,\nAre buried in the earth below;\nAll that is old doth perish there\nTo form a life both new and fair:\nSo too are we from self and sin made free.", "2 Through suff'ring Thou, O Christ, didst go\nUnto Thy throne above,\nAnd leadest now the selfsame way\nThose true in faith and love;\nSo lead us, then, though suff'rings wait,\nTo share Thy kingdom's heav'nly state;\nThy death has broken Satan's might,\nAnd leads the faithful to the light;\nEternal light, from darkness into light.", "3 Thou hast, O Savior, led the way\nThrough agony and death;\nO give, we pray, yet more and more\nThy Spirit's living breath!\nSend messengers o'er land and sea\nTo bring Thy children all to Thee;\nThy name can save, Thy name makes free;\nWe consecrate ourselves to Thee\nAs servants true, as warriors brave and true."]
