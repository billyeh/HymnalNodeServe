["1 Day by day, and with each passing moment,\nStrength I find to meet my trials here;\nTrusting in my Father's wise bestowment,\nI've no cause for worry or for fear.\nHe, whose heart is kind beyond all measure,\nGives unto each day what He deems best,\nLovingly its part of pain and pleasure,\nMingling toil with peace and rest.", "2 Every day the Lord Himself is near me,\nWith a special mercy for each hour;\nAll my cares He fain would bear and cheer me,\nHe whose name is Counsellor and Pow'r.\nThe protection of His child and treasure\nIs a charge that on Himself He laid;\n\"As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,\"\nThis the pledge to me He made.", "3 Help me then, in every tribulation,\nSo to trust Thy promises, O Lord,\nThat I lose not faith's sweet consolation,\nOffered me within Thy holy Word.\nHelp me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,\nE'er to take, as from a father's hand,\nOne by one, the days, the moments fleeting,\nTill with Christ the Lord I stand."]
