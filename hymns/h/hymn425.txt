["1 Prince of peace, control my will;\nBid this struggling heart be still:\nBid my fears and doubtings cease:\nHush my spirit into peace.", "2 Thou hast bought me with Thy blood,\nOpened wide the gate to God;\nPeace I ask, but peace must be,\nLord, in being one with Thee.", "3 May Thy will, not mine be done;\nMay Thy will and mine be one;\nChase these doubtings from my heart,\nNow Thy perfect peace impart.", "4 Savior, at Thy feet I fall,\nThou, my life, my God, my all;\nLet Thy happy servant be\nOne forevermore with Thee."]
