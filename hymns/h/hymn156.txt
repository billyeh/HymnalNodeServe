["1 I have a Friend, whose faithful love\nIs more than all the world to me:\n'Tis higher than the heights above,\nAnd deeper than the soundless sea;\nSo old, so new,\nSo strong, so true;\nBefore the earth received its frame,\nHe loved me-Blessed be His name!", "2 He held the highest place above,\nAdored by all the sons of flame,\nYet such His self-denying love,\nHe laid aside His crown and came\nTo seek the lost,\nAnd at the cost\nOf heavenly rank and earthly fame\nHe sought me-Blessed be His name!", "3 It was a lonely path He trod,\nFrom every human soul apart;\nKnown only to Himself and God\nWas all the grief that filled His heart,\nYet from the track\nHe turned not back,\nTill where I lay in want and shame,\nHe found me-Blessed be His name!", "4 Then dawned at last that day of dread,\nWhen desolate, yet undismayed,\nWith wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,\nHe, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,\nWas then made sin\nOn Calvary,\nAnd, dying there in grief and shame,\nHe saved me-Blessed be His name!", "5 Long as I live my song shall tell\nThe wonders of His dying love;\nAnd when at last I go to dwell\nWith Him His sovereign grace to prove,\nMy joy shall be\nHis face to see,\nAnd bowing there with loud acclaim\nI'll praise Him-Blessed be His name!"]
