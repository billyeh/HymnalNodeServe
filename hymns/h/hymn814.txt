["1 \"Man shall not live by bread alone\nBut by each word which doth proceed,\nFrom God's own mouth\" these we must eat,\nAnd let them be our life indeed.", "2 Not just a body we were made\nBut body, soul, and spirit too;\nThe inmost part the spirit is,\nTo contact God and Him pursue.", "3 Just as we need the earthly food,\nOur body's need to satisfy\nWe need the food for spirit too-\nThyself, Thy Word, its true supply.", "4 Thou art the Spirit, and Thy Word,\nThy very Self expressed doth make;\nThus, it is Spirit as Thyself\nWhich by our spirit we must take.", "5 Thus, to receive Thy Word is not,\nTo read it only with our eyes,\nAnd understand it in our mind\nBut 'tis the spirit's exercise.", "6 Thy Word in spirit we must eat,\nAnd to our inmost part receive;\n'Tis by our spirit's exercise,\nTo pray with what our minds perceive.", "7 Thy Word remaining in our mind,\nIs only knowledge burdensome\nBut when it to the spirit goes,\nThen life and spirit it becomes.", "8 'Tis only when our spirit acts,\nTo take Thy Word and contact Thee\nWe truly feed upon Thy Word,\nAnd touch Thyself most inwardly.", "9 Lord, teach us how to exercise,\nOur spirit when Thy Word we read;\nThen will our spirit nourished be,\nAs thus upon Thyself we feed."]
