["1 How shall I follow Him I serve?\nHow shall I copy Him I love?\nNor from those blessed footsteps swerve,\nWhich lead me to His seat above?", "2 Privations, sorrows, bitter scorn,\nThe life of toil, the mean abode,\nThe faithless kiss, the crown of thorn-\nAre these the consecrated road?", "3 Lord, should my path through suff'ring lie,\nForbid it I should e'er repine;\nStill let me turn to Calvary,\nNor heed my griefs, rememb'ring Thine.", "4 O let me think how Thou didst leave\nUntasted every pure delight,\nTo fast, to faint, to watch, to grieve,\nThe toilsome day, the homeless night:", "5 To faint, to grieve, to die for me!\nThou camest, not Thyself to please;\nAnd, dear as earthly comforts be,\nShall I not love Thee more than these?"]
