["1 Amid the trials that I meet,\nAmid the thorns that pierce my feet,\nOne thought remains supremely sweet-\nThou thinkest, Lord, of me!", "chorus Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!\nThou thinkest, Lord, of me!\nWhat need I fear when Thou art near,\nAnd thinkest, Lord, of me!", "2 The cares of life come thronging fast,\nUpon my soul their shadows cast;\nTheir gloom reminds my heart at last\nThou thinkest, Lord, of me!", "3 Let shadows come, let shadows go,\nLet life be bright, or dark with woe,\nI am content, for this I know\nThou thinkest, Lord, of me!"]
