["1 There is no gain but by a loss;\nWe cannot save but by the cross,\nThe corn of wheat to multiply\nMust fall into the ground and die;\nO should a soul alone remain\nWhen it a hundredfold can gain?\nO should a soul alone remain\nWhen it a hundredfold can gain?", "2 Our souls are held by all they hold;\nSlaves still are slaves in chains of gold;\nTo whatsoever we may cling,\nWe make it a soul-chaining thing.\nWhether it be a life or land,\nAnd dear as our right eye or hand.\nWhether it be a life or land,\nAnd dear as our right eye or hand.", "3 Wherever you ripe fields behold,\nWaving to God their sheaves of gold,\nBe sure some com of wheat has died,\nSome saintly soul been crucified;\nSomeone has suffered, wept and prayed,\nAnd fought hell's legions undismayed.\nSomeone has suffered, wept and prayed,\nAnd fought hell's legions undismayed."]
