["1 Jesus is standing in Pilate's hall-\nFriendless, forsaken, betrayed by all:\nHearken! what meaneth the sudden call?\nWhat will you do with Jesus?", "chorus What will you do with Jesus?\nNeutral you cannot be;\nSome day your heart will be asking,\n\"What will He do with me?\"", "2 Jesus is standing on trial still,\nYou can be false to Him if you will,\nYou can be faithful through good or ill:\nWhat will you do with Jesus?", "3 Will you evade Him as Pilate tried?\nOr will you choose Him, whate'er betide?\nVainly you struggle from Him to hide:\nWhat will you do with Jesus?", "4 Will you, like Peter, your Lord deny?\nOr will you scorn from His foes to fly,\nDaring for Jesus to live or die?\nWhat will you do with Jesus?", "5 \"Jesus, I give Thee my heart today!\nJesus, I'll follow Thee all the way,\nGladly obeying Thee!\" will you say:\n\"This will I do with Jesus!\""]
