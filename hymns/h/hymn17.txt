["1 My Father God, when on Thy vast creation\nThe wonders of the heav'n and earth, I gaze\nThings great and small, beyond enumeration\nWhich manifest Thy pow'r in untold ways;", "chorus Then all my being sings in praise to Thee\nHow marvellous! How great Thou art!\nAnd this I'll sing through all eternity\nHow marvellous! How great Thou art!", "2 As I enjoy the grace of Thy salvation,\nAnd contemplate how Thou Thy Son hast sent\nWho died that we might be Thy new creation\nThy life expressing to the full extent;", "3 When in the church, in blest participation\nI see how millions Thine own life possess\nHow they are built to form Thy habitation\nContaining Thee, Thy fulness to express;", "4 As I expect the coming age of fulness,\nAnd hope to share the new Jerusalem\nWith all the heavens and the earth in newness,\nAnd all Thou art expressed in all of them;"]
