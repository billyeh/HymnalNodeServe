["1 Our worship in reality\nIs typified in Moses' law:\nWith Canaan's produce, rich and sweet,\nAll Israel came and worshipped God.", "2 'Tis thus that we must come today\nTo worship in reality:\nWhen we bring Christ as produce sweet\nGod fully satisfied will be.", "3 The worship that God so desired\nWas not with manna sent from heav'n,\nBut from their labor on the land\nThe people's gifts to God were giv'n.", "4 Thus, what God so desires today.\nAre not the miracles so grand,\nBut daily, normal life in Christ,\nAs worship, produce of the land.", "5 The manna came from God alone;\nThe produce, from man's work on Him.\nSo all our worship now must come\nFrom mingling with the Lord within.", "6 As day by day we live in Christ,\nAnd take Him as our everything,\nThe produce of the land comes forth\nAnd worship true to God we'll bring.", "7 The manna, Lord, no more we'll seek,\nBut Christ in all we will apply;\nThen we will have some produce sweet,\nThine own dear heart to satisfy."]
