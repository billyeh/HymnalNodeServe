["1 Nothing either great or small-\nNothing, sinner, no;\nJesus did it, did it all,\nLong, long ago.", "chorus \"It is finished!\" yes, indeed,\nFinished every jot:\nSinner, this is all you need-\nTell me, is it not?", "2 When He, from His lofty throne,\nStooped to do and die,\nEverything was fully done;\nHearken to His cry:", "3 Weary, working, burdened one,\nWherefore toil you so?\nCease your doing; all was done\nLong, long ago.", "4 Till to Jesus' work you cling\nBy a simple faith,\n\"Doing\" is a deadly thing-\n\"Doing\" ends in death.", "5 Cast your deadly \"doing\" down-\nDown at Jesus' feet;\nStand in Him, in Him alone,\nGloriously complete."]
