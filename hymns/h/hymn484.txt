["1 When Christ once died on Calvary,\nI too was there;\n'Twas in my place He stood for me,\nAnd now accepted e'en as He,\nHis name I bear.", "chorus I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live,\nYet, not I, but Christ who liveth in me;\nAnd the life I live in the flesh,\nI live by the faith of the Son of God,\nWho loved, and gave Himself for me.", "2 When Christ once rose with life divine,\nI too was there;\nHis resurrection pow'r is mine,\nAnd as the branches and the vine\nHis life I share.", "3 When Christ will come some day for me,\nI shall be there;\nWith Him and like Him I shall be,\nAnd all His glorious majesty\nI too shall share.", "4 O blessed life so deep, so high,\nLord, keep me there;\nHelp me with Christ to live, to die,\nAnd let me with Him, bye and bye\nHis glory share."]
