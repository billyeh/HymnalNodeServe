["1 O Christ, what burdens bow'd Thy head!\nOur load was laid on Thee;\nThou stoodest in the sinner's stead,\nDidst bear all ill for me.\nA victim led; Thy blood was shed;\nNow there's no load for me.", "2 Death and the curse were in our cup,\nO Christ, 'twas full for Thee!\nBut Thou hast drained the last dark drop-\n'Tis empty now for me.\nThat bitter cup-love drank it up;\nNow blessings' draught for me.", "3 Jehovah lifted up His rod,\nO Christ, it fell on Thee!\nThou wast sore stricken of Thy God;\nThere's not one stroke for me.\nThy tears, Thy blood, beneath it flowed;\nThy bruising healeth me.", "4 The tempest's awful voice was heard,\nO Christ, it broke on Thee!\nThy open bosom was my ward,\nIt braved the storm for me.\nThy form was scarred, Thy visage marred;\nNow cloudless peace for me.", "5 Jehovah bade His sword awake,\nO Christ, it woke 'gainst Thee!\nThy blood the flaming blade must slake;\nThy heart its sheath must be-\nAll for my sake, my peace to make;\nNow sleeps that sword for me.", "6 For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,\nAnd I have died in Thee;\nThou'rt ris'n: \"my bands are all untied,\nAnd now Thou liv'st in me.\nWhen purified, made white, and tried,\nThy glory then for me!"]
