["1 Lord Jesus, Thou dost keep Thy child\nThru sunshine or thru tempests wild;\nJesus, I trust in Thee:\nThine is such wondrous pow'r to save;\nThine is the mighty love that gave\nIts all on Calvary.", "2 O glorious Savior, Thee I praise;\nTo Thee my new glad song I raise,\nAnd tell of what Thou art.\nThy grace is boundless in its store;\nThy face of love shines evermore;\nThou givest me Thy heart.", "3 Upon Thy promises I stand,\nTrusting in Thee: \"Thine own right hand\nDoth keep and comfort me;\nMy soul doth triumph in Thy word;\nThine, Thine be all the praise, dear Lord,\nAs Thine the victory.", "4 Love perfecteth what it begins;\nThy power doth save me from my sins;\nThy grace upholdeth me.\nThis life of trust, how glad, how sweet;\nMy need and Thy great fulness meet,\nAnd I have all in Thee."]
