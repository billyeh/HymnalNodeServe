["1 Passing through another week,\nGod has granted us His aid;\nLet us now a blessing seek,\nOn the day the Lord hath made;\nDay of all the week the best,\nEmblem of eternal rest.", "2 While we pray for pard'ning grace,\nThrough the dear Redeemer's name,\nShow Thy reconciled face;\nTake away our sin and shame:\nFrom our worldly cares set free,\nMay we rest this day in Thee.", "3 Here we come Thy name to praise,\nLet us feel Thy presence near;\nMay Thy glory meet our eyes,\nWhile we in Thy house appear:\nHere afford us, Lord, a taste\nOf our everlasting feast.", "4 May Thy gospel's joyful sound\nConquer sinners, comfort saints;\nMake the fruits of grace abound,\nBring relief for all complaints:\nThus may all our Lord's Days prove,\nTill we meet the Lord above.\nnote: \"(Repeat the last two lines of each stanza)"]
