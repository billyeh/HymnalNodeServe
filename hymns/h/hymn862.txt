["1 Jesus, where'er Thy people meet,\nThere they behold Thy mercy-seat;\nWhere'er they seek Thee, Thou art found,\nWith grace and mercy to abound.", "2 For Thou, within no walls confined,\nInhabitest the humble mind;\nSuch ever bring Thee where they come,\nAnd going, take Thee to their home.", "3 Dear Shepherd of Thy chosen few,\nThy former mercies here renew;\nHere, to our waiting hearts, proclaim\nThe sweetness of Thy saving Name.", "4 Here may we prove the power of prayer\nTo strengthen faith and sweeten care;\nTo teach our faint desires to rise,\nAnd bring Thy light before our eyes.", "5 Lord, we are few, but Thou art near;\nNor short Thine arm, nor deaf Thine ear;\nOh, rend the heavens, come quickly down,\nAnd make our waiting hearts Thine own.", "6 Command Thy blessing in this hour;\nAnd as the Spirit full of pow'r\nWith life and vision fill this place,\nThat all Thy purpose we may trace.", "7 O Thou, our Head, our Life, our Guide,\nMay nought in life or death divide\nThe saints in Thy communion blessed,\nThat all Thy fulness be expressed."]
