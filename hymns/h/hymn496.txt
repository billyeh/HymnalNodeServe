["1 Christ is the one reality of all\nOf Godhead and of man and all things else;\nNo man without Him ever findeth God\nWithout Him man and everything is false.", "2 All types and figures of the ancient time\nAll things we ever need, both great and small\nOnly are shadows of the Christ of God\nShowing that He must be our all in all.", "3 All things are vanity of vanities\nChrist, the reality all things to fill;\nThough everything we may enjoy and own\nIf we're devoid of Christ we're empty still.", "4 Christ is our real God, our real Lord\nChrist is our real life, our real light;\nChrist is our real food, our real drink\nOur real clothing, and our real might.", "5 Christ also is the one reality,\nOf all our doctrine and theology;\nAnd all our scriptural knowledge without Him,\nIs just in letter and is vanity.", "6 Christ, the reality of time and space\nChrist, the reality of every stage;\nChrist is the one reality of all,\nThru all eternity from age to age."]
