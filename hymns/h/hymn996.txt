["1 Jesus, Savior, Son of God,\nBearer of the sinner's load,\nBreaker of the captive's chain,\nCleanser of the guilty's stain.", "2 Thou the sinner's death hast died,\nThou for us wast crucified;\nFor our sins Thy flesh was torn,\nThou our penalty hast borne.", "3 Savior, Surety, Lamb of God,\nThou hast bought us with Thy blood;\nThou hast wiped the debt away,\nNothing left for us to pay;", "4 Nothing left for us to bear,\nNothing left for us to share\nBut the pardon and the bliss,\nBut the love, the light, the peace.", "5 I to Thee will look and live,\nAnd, in looking, praises give;\nLooking lightens, looking heals,\nLooking all the gladness seals.", "6 Jesus, Savior, Son of God,\nBearer of the sinner's load,\nI would rise to Thee above,\nI would look, and praise, and love."]
