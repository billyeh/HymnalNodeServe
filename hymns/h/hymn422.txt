["1 Make me a captive, Lord.\nAnd then I shall be free;\nForce me to render up my sword,\nAnd I shall conq'ror be.\nI sink in life's alarms\nWhen by myself I stand,\nImprison me within Thine arms,\nAnd strong shall be my hand.", "2 My heart is weak and poor\nUntil it master find:\nIt has no spring of action sure,\nIt varies with the wind;\nIt cannot freely move\nTill Thou hast wrought its chain;\nEnslave it with Thy matchless love,\nAnd deathless it shall reign.", "3 My power is faint and low\nTill I have learned to serve:\nIt wants the needed fire to glow,\nIt wants the breeze to nerve;\nIt cannot drive the world\nUntil itself be driven;\nIts flag can only be unfurled\nWhen Thou shalt breathe from heaven.", "4 My will is not my own\nTill Thou hast made it Thine;\nIf it would reach the monarch's throne\nIt must its crown resign;\nIt only stands unbent\nAmid the clashing strife,\nWhen on Thy bosom it has leant,\nAnd found in Thee its life."]
