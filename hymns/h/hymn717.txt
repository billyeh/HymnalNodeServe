["1 O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,\nThough all things around us be trying,\nThough floods of affliction like sea billows roar,\nIt's better to sing than be sighing.", "chorus Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,\nIt is better to sing than be sighing:\nIt is better to live than be dying;\nSo let us rejoice evermore.", "2 O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,\nWhen the darts of the tempter are flying,\nFor Satan still dreads, as he oft did of yore,\nOur singing much more than our sighing.", "3 O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,\nWhen sickness upon us is stealing,\nNo cordial like gladness our strength can restore,\nFor joy is the fountain of healing."]
