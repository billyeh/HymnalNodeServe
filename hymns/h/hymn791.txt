["1 The priest's position holy is;\nHe sacrifices e'er to God\nBeholds His beauty, incense burns,\nOf prayer before the Lord.\n,", "chorus Let us the incense burn,\nOf prayer before the Lord;\nThe lamp we'd light, through day and night,\nOur praise to Him outpoured.", "2 No natural light, but just the lamp,\nWithin the holy place gives sight;\nWhene'er the priest the incense burns\nThe lamp he too must light.", "3 The grace of God let us extol,\nAnd stir our heart sweet praise to sing;\nFor priests not only light the lamp\nBut constant praises bring.", "4 I'll offer prayers as incense burns\nChrist's resurrection bring therein\nGod's wish thus meet, His heart give joy\nAnd I'll rejoice with Him.", "5 I'll read His Word, His light receive\nE'en as the lamp before Him lit\nHis holy light illum'ning me,\nTo others I'll transmit.", "6 Unto the Lord His praise I'll sing,\nAs holy priests their songs did raise;\nO may my heart be filled with Him,\nHis love and grace to praise.", "7 I'll offer Christ to God in prayer\nI'll read the Word, His light to know\nFor all His grace I'll sing His praise\nThe Spirit then may flow."]
