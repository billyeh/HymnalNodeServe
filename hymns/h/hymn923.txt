["1 Go to collect materials for the House\nGo to convince dear souls and bring them in;\nBring in the very souls whom God has made\nBring in the souls usurped by every sin.", "2 Go to collect materials for the House\nGo to deliver people from the world\nFrom all Satanic darkness and deceit\nFrom the allurements Satan has unfurled.", "3 Go to collect materials for the House\nGo to win souls to glorify the Lord;\nGo to defeat the enemy of God\nGo, sinners to release, with one accord.", "4 Go to collect materials for the House\nGo, Christ proclaiming, on the Body ground;\nGo thus in oneness with the faithful saints\nAnd let the trumpet of the gospel sound."]
