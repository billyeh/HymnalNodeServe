["1 I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast shown,\nAnd I begin to see,\nWhat Thou canst be to all Thine own,\nWhat they may be to Thee;\nIf only they will yield Thee all,\nAnd trustingly obey Thy call.", "2 How wonderful! I never knew\nThat I might trust Thee so;\nThat Thou wouldst be so much to me.\nIn all the way I go,\nThat every need Thou wouldst supply.\nAnd all my longings satisfy.", "3 I take Thee as my keeper now\nAnd I commit to Thee\nMy soul, my way, my works, my cause.\nIn Thy sole charge to be;\nAnd my deposit, Thou, I know\nWilt guard secure from every foe.", "4 I take Thee for my peace, O Lord.\nMy heart to keep and fill\nThine own great calm, amid earth's storms\nShall keep me always still;\nAnd as Thy kingdom doth increase,\nSo shall Thine ever-deep'ning peace.", "5 I take Thee as my wisdom too\nFor wisdom's sum Thou art;\nThou, who dost choose the foolish things.\nSet me henceforth apart,\nThat I may speak and work for Thee\nAs Thou shalt work and speak in me.", "6 I take Thee, Lord, to be my all.\nSince all Thou art is mine;\nI nothing have, and nothing am;\nThat nothing, Lord, is Thine.\nThou shalt be everything to me\nIn all things my sufficiency."]
