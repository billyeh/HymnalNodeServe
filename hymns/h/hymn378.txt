["1 Savior, lead me up the mountain,\nWhere the Lord alone is seen,\nWhere we hear the voice from heaven,\nWhere the air is pure and clean.", "chorus Lead me higher up the mountain,\nGive me fellowship with Thee;\nIn Thy light I see the fountain,\nAnd the blood it cleanses me.", "2 Higher up where light increases,\nFar above all earthly strife,\nWhere the strain of effort ceases,\nWhere in Christ we reign in Life.", "3 Savior, keep me up the mountain\nPressing on toward the goal,\nTill, as one, we share Thine image,\nAnd Thy love and grace extol."]
