["1 Thy name we love, Lord Jesus,\nAnd lowly bow before Thee;\nAnd while we live, to Thee we give\nAll blessing, worship, glory.\nWe sing aloud Thy praises,\nOur hearts and voices blending,\n'Tis Thou alone we worthy own,\nThy beauty's all-transcending.", "2 Thy name we love, Lord Jesus;\nIt tells God's love unbounded\nTo ruined man, ere time began,\nOr heav'n and earth were founded:\nThine is a love eternal,\nThat found in us its pleasure,\nThat brought Thee low to bear our woe\nAnd make us Thine own treasure.", "3 Thy name we love, Lord Jesus;\nIt tells Thy birth so lowly,\nThy patience, grace, and gentleness,\nThy lonely path, so holy;\nThou wast the \"Man of Sorrows\";\nOur grief, too, Thou didst bear it;\nOur bitter cup Thou drankest up;\nThe thorny crown, didst wear it.", "4 Thy name we love, Lord Jesus;\nGod's Lamb-Thou wast ordained,\nTo bear our sins (Thyself all clean)\nAnd hast our guilt sustained.\nWe see Thee crowned in glory,\nAbove the heavens now seated,\nThe vict'ry won, Thy work well done,\nOur righteousness completed."]
