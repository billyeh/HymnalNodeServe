["1 Rejoice in the Lord! Oh, let His mercy cheer;\nHe sunders the bands that enthrall;\nRedeemed by His blood, why should we ever fear,\nSince Jesus is our all in all?", "chorus If God be for us, if God be for us,\nif God be for us,\nWho can be against us?\nWho? who? who?\nWho can be against us, against us?", "2 Be strong in the Lord! rejoicing in His might,\nBe loyal and true day by day;\nWhen evils assail, be valiant for the right,\nAnd He will be our strength and stay.", "3 Confide in His Word, His promises so sure;\nIn Christ they are yea and amen;\nThough earth pass away, they ever shall endure,\n'Tis written o'er and o'er again.", "4 Abide in the Lord, secure in His control,\n'Tis life everlasting begun;\nTo pluck from His hand the weakest, trembling soul,\nIt never, never can be done!"]
