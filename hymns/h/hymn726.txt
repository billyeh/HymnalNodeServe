["1 Long plunged in sorrow, I resign\nMy soul to that dear hand of Thine,\nWithout reserve or fear;\nThat hand shall wipe my streaming eyes,\nOr into smiles of glad surprise\nTransform the falling tear.", "2 Adieu! ye vain delights of earth;\nInsipid sports, and childish mirth,\nI taste no sweets in you;\nUnknown delights are in the cross,\nAll joy beside to me is dross;\nAnd Jesus thought so too.", "3 The Cross! O ravishment and bliss-\nHow grateful e'en its anguish is;\nIts bitterness how sweet!\nThere every sense, and all the mind,\nIn all her faculties refined,\nTaste happiness complete.", "4 Self-love no grace in sorrow sees,\nConsults her own peculiar ease:\n'Tis all the bliss she knows;\nBut nobler aims true love employ.\nIn self-denial is her joy,\nIn suffering her repose.", "5 Thy choice and mine shall be the same,\nInspirer of that holy flame\nWhich must forever blaze!\nTo take the cross and follow Thee,\nWhere love and duty lead, shall be\nMy portion and my praise."]
