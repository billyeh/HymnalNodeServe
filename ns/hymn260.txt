["1 Abraham is the father of faith to all,\nHe was counted as righteous by heeding God's call.\nDid you know all your works never justify?\nBelieve! You are justified by faith in Him.", "2 I believe, He gives life to the dead;\nI believe, He creates righteous men;\nAll your works never justify the sins you've done.\nBelieve! He creates His righteousness within."]
