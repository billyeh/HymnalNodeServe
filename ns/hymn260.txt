{"1": "Abraham is the father of faith to all,
He was counted as righteous by heeding God's call.
Did you know all your works never justify?
Believe! You are justified by faith in Him.",
"2": "I believe, He gives life to the dead;
I believe, He creates righteous men;
All your works never justify the sins you've done.
Believe! He creates His righteousness within."}
