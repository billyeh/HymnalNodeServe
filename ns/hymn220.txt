{"1": "Lord, keep me from this evil and perverted age;
Wholly sanctify my eyes-on You to gaze.
Satisfy my deepest part.
O Lord, preserve my heart.",
"2": "Rescue me, Lord, from this dark world-it's just display.
Shine in me, and show me, Lord, You are the way.
Nothing matches me but You.
Only Your life will do.",
"3": "Lord, cause my love for You to grow in me each day.
Through this love, show me the world's passing away.
Separate me unto You.
O Lord, my heart renew.",
"4": "Don't let me go; I'm here for You and this You know.
Day by day, Your life within me has to grow.
Though this world is so corrupt,
I can and do love You.",
"5": "O Lord, become a river flowing out of me,
That the world may take a drink of You and see
That You are the only way,
The One reality."}
