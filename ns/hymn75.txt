["1 From my spirit, when I'm sensing the supply\nOf God's speaking, from a fount that ne'er runs dry,\nAnd within me comes a fresh and sweet supply,\nThen I've got to open up and water you.", "chorus Water you, water you,\nFrom the flowing in my spirit water you;\nWhen the saints need my supply,\nThen I'll surely testify,\nI'll stand up, release my Christ and water you!", "2 In the meeting, when the spirit's rising high,\nAnd it seems like we will go beyond the sky-\nI can't help it, I must speak or else I'll die,\nFor my Christ is rising up to water you.", "3 Should a pause come, or the meeting ebb real low,\nWhile within me there's a rich and living flow,\nThen I'll stand up, so that all the saints will know,\nThat I'm here to share my Christ and water you.", "4 In the church life, in our daily living too,\nIn the meeting, and in everything we do,\nChrist is speaking and the Spirit's breaking through,\nThat is why there's the supply to water you."]
