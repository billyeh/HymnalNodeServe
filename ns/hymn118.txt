{"1": "Jesus Lord, You're our first love;
You're the One we love the best.
When our heart is loving You,
How we're filled with Your sweet rest!",
"2": "Lord, we love You for Yourself,
Not for what You give or do.
Nothing else could e'er compare
With the joy of loving You.",
"chorus": "Lord, we've been drawn off by many things;
Now we turn our heart back-how it sings!
We repent of loving other things-
Jesus, Lord, You're our first love.",
"3": "Never more could we desire
Anything that's less than You,
And to this we would aspire-
Simply to be filled with You.",
"4": "Jesus Lord, You're our first love;
You're the One we love the best.
When our heart is loving You,
How we're filled with Your sweet rest!"}
