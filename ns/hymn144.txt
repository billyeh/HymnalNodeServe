{"chorus": "Our spirit is our organ to receive God.
So every day, all the time, we must exercise,
Exercise this organ to take the word.
In this way, we receive life.
This is the experience of life.
The experience of life is just to exercise,
Exercise our spirit
To eat the word that we may receive life.
After being received by us
This life will live out all kind of
Divine, spiritual, and heavenly things
In an unlimited way."}
