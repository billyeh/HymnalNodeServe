["1 Lord, I am continually with Thee:\nThou hast holden me by my right hand,\nThou shalt guide me-\nThou shalt guide me with Thy counsel,\nAnd afterward receive me-\nReceive me to glory.", "2 Whom have I in heaven but Thee?\nAnd there is none upon the earth\nThat I desire beside Thee.\nMy flesh and my heart faileth;\nBut God is the strength of my heart,\nAnd my portion forever."]
