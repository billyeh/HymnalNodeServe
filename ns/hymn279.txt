{"nonum": "Love suffers long. Love is kind; it is not jealous.
Love does not brag and is not puffed up.
Love suffers long. Love is kind; it is not jealous.
Love does not brag and is not puffed up.",
"nonum": "It does not behave unbecomingly;
It does not seek its own things;
It is not provoked and does not take account of evil;
It does not rejoice because of unrighteousness,
But rejoices with the truth.",
"nonum": "It covers all things, believes all things,
Hopes all things, endures all things.
Love never falls away, Love never falls away,
Love never falls away, Love never falls away."}
