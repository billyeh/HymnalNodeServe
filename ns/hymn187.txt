{"1": "Turn to your spirit, where the Spirit of Jesus is;
Turn to your spirit-Oh, how it makes you sing!
Turn to your spirit in the middle of everything.
Turn to the Lord. Oh, turn to the Lord!",
"2": "Turn to your spirit, where the Spirit of Jesus is,
Turn to your spirit-where life is really found.
Turn to your spirit if you're up or if you're down,
Turn to the Lord. Oh, turn to the Lord!",
"3": "Turn to your spirit, where the Spirit of Jesus is,
Turn to your spirit, calling upon His name-
Now and forever, Jesus is the very same.
Turn to the Lord. Oh, turn to the Lord!"}
