{"nonum": "For I'm persuaded to believe
Nothing can separate us
From the wonderful love of God;
For the Lord who has called us
According to His purpose
Works all things together for good;
Neither height, nor depth,
Nor principalities,
Things present, nor things to come,
Though the devil hates us,
He can never separate us
From the wonderful love of God."}
