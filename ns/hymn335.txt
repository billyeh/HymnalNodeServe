["nonum For I'm persuaded to believe\nNothing can separate us\nFrom the wonderful love of God;\nFor the Lord who has called us\nAccording to His purpose\nWorks all things together for good;\nNeither height, nor depth,\nNor principalities,\nThings present, nor things to come,\nThough the devil hates us,\nHe can never separate us\nFrom the wonderful love of God."]
