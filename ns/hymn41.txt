{"chorus": "Lord, I thank You for another new day to live You;
Another day for me to practise being one spirit with You.
Remind me this whole day to reject my self,
Not to trust myself,
And not to live by myself.
Strengthen me to live by You.
Make this a day for me to live You out.
Taking You as my everything,
Abiding in You as a branch in the vine."}
