["1 Little by little,\nThe Lord is cutting off all our natural life;\nAs we grow in Him,\nHe replaces us with more of His life divine.", "chorus It is our destiny,\nTo live a normal life in the divine dispensing,\nIt is a blessing,\nTo be satisfied with ordinary days\n  in the divine dispensing.", "2 Day by day,\nOur inward parts are being renewed by the Lord;\nEvery day,\nFresh and rich supply to us He does afford.", "3 Here a little,\nAnd there a little, Christ reveals Himself to us;\nWhen we read His word,\nWe are satisfied and we enjoy Him thus.", "4 Morning by morning,\nJehovah He is faithful to awaken us;\nHe instructs our ears,\nWith just a word, the weary to sustain we must.", "5 From strength to strength,\nWe're on the highways to enter into our God;\nThough Satan opposes,\nWe are strengthened to lay hold of more of God.", "6 Grace upon grace,\nThe Triune God is processed for us to enjoy;\nThe law is over,\nNow we can partake of His supply through grace.", "7 From glory to glory,\nWe are in the process of being transformed;\nBeholding, reflecting,\nTo God's image with all saints we'll be conformed."]
