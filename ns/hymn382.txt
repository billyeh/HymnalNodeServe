{"1": "Little by little,
The Lord is cutting off all our natural life;
As we grow in Him,
He replaces us with more of His life divine.",
"chorus": "It is our destiny,
To live a normal life in the divine dispensing,
It is a blessing,
To be satisfied with ordinary days
  in the divine dispensing.",
"2": "Day by day,
Our inward parts are being renewed by the Lord;
Every day,
Fresh and rich supply to us He does afford.",
"3": "Here a little,
And there a little, Christ reveals Himself to us;
When we read His word,
We are satisfied and we enjoy Him thus.",
"4": "Morning by morning,
Jehovah He is faithful to awaken us;
He instructs our ears,
With just a word, the weary to sustain we must.",
"5": "From strength to strength,
We're on the highways to enter into our God;
Though Satan opposes,
We are strengthened to lay hold of more of God.",
"6": "Grace upon grace,
The Triune God is processed for us to enjoy;
The law is over,
Now we can partake of His supply through grace.",
"7": "From glory to glory,
We are in the process of being transformed;
Beholding, reflecting,
To God's image with all saints we'll be conformed."}
