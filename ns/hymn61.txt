{"1": "Early in the morning,
Meeting with the saints,
Gather the fresh manna,
Take in His rich grace!",
"chorus": "Christ in all the saints,
Living, fresh and new.
Blending with each other,
Tasting morning dew!",
"2": "Singing songs together,
Spirits exercised.
Drawing from each other,
Christ is realized!",
"3": "Reading in the Bible,
Each one taking turns;
Fellowship together,
How our spirit burns!",
"4": "Praying for our loved ones,
Bring them to the throne.
Christ desires to save them,
Bringing them all home!",
"5": "Morning, noon and evening,
Gath'ring with the saints;
Joy in each one's presence,
Taking in fresh grace."}
