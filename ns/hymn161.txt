{"1": "I've found the One who's all to me;
He's become reality.
Now He's in my life to stay;
He is the truth, the life, the way.",
"chorus": "And Jesus is the One who came
Down to earth to bear our shame,
But that's not all, He lives in me.
Once I was blind, but now I see.",
"2": "Now through His life we have the flow,
Showing us the way to go;
Keeping us in unity,
And this is His recovery.",
"3": "Now Jesus is the Lord of all;
On His name we all must call.
Then our spirits find release,
And thus our hearts have found real peace."}
