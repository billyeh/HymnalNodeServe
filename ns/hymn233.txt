{"1": "Not poquito, nor kidogo
I love the Lord a whole bunch.
(Un muchos!!)
Nicht ein bischen, shao or choto-
I love the Lord a whole bunch.
Grandios and muchos
Colossal un da-
I love You, Lord-O so much.
Not a little but a bunch.",
"2": "Lord, I do not have all the words
To speak my love out to You.
For Your love to me surpasses
All words that ever I knew.
All the languages, though so different
They all can say the same thing-
That my love for You is great.
I love You, Lord-O so much!"}
