{"1": "Now the Lord is the Spirit-that's how
He can get inside of you right now.
It's so easy to be filled with Him.
He's made it really simple.
One, two, three-
That's how easy it can be.",
"chorus": "O Lord! Amen!
That's the way to let Him in.
Hallelujah! I love to hear it.
He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.",
"2": "Now the Lord is the living air;
You can breathe Him in anywhere-
Anytime of day, whenever you please.
He's made it really easy.
O Lord! Amen!
Let's sing it again.",
"3": "Now the Lord lives inside of me.
And He's filling me constantly.
Yes, He's filling up every gap.
He makes me really happy.
I'm so happy!
Hallelujah! Taste and see!"}
