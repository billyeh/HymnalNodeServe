["1 From the time I spoke Your name,\nLord, my life's not been the same\nSince I called on the only One who'd save me.\nWhen forsaken, in despair-\nWho'd have thought that You'd be there!\nNow I've found out, Jesus, You're alive!", "chorus Now my eyes begin to see\nI'm living as I ought to be,\nAs this turning, burning God\nmoves in my heart...\nI don't care now how I feel;\nI just know that this is real,\nAnd I know, oh Jesus, You're alive!", "2 All my friends might think it's square-\nSince I touched You, I don't care-\nFor I've found You're the only life worth living.\nThough some mock and criticize,\nLord, they just don't realize\nThat I've found out, Jesus, You're alive!", "3 It's no statue that I call,\nNot a picture on the wall,\nBut a person who lives His life within me.\nWish they'd told me long before,\nAll You want's an open door\nAnd that really, Jesus, You're alive!"]
