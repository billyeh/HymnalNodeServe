["1 These are the days, my friend,\nTime's drawing to an end,\nAnd we must choose,\nmust choose whom we will serve.\nWe will fight for the Lord\nAnd stand in one accord\nFor the defeat of God's arch enemy!", "2 These are the days, O saints,\nThe heart of man, it faints\nFor Satan's work\nthat's seen throughout the land.\nSo we must count all loss,\nBe one at any cost,\nAnd give our all for God's recovery.", "3 These are the days, my friend,\nThe Spirits moving in\nTo raise the standard\nup against the foe,\nTo show the one new man\nAccording to His plan\nAnd draw this generation to Himself.", "4 These are the latter days,\nGo forth and sound His praise,\nProclaim to men\nthe kingdom that shall come.\nThe army's moving out\nThe enemy to rout,\nAnd Christ will gain His rightful place on earth."]
