["1 Jesus Lord, I long\nFor Your embrace\nTo taste Your kisses sweeter than wine,\nTo know the love that surpasses all time,\nTo feel the joy when I am in Your arms,\nPrecious One.", "2 Jesus Lord, You died \nTo set me free.\nNow You're my all and my everything;\nI am so lost when I'm not near Thee;\nSick with love for You I'll ever be,\nTreasured One.", "3 Jesus Lord, I'm charmed\nBy Your mercy\nAnd I rejoice that You've chosen me\nTo be with You in eternity\nBut until then keep me close to Thee,\nLovely One."]
