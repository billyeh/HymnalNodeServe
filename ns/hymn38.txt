{"1": "Jesus Lord, I long
For Your embrace
To taste Your kisses sweeter than wine,
To know the love that surpasses all time,
To feel the joy when I am in Your arms,
Precious One.",
"2": "Jesus Lord, You died 
To set me free.
Now You're my all and my everything;
I am so lost when I'm not near Thee;
Sick with love for You I'll ever be,
Treasured One.",
"3": "Jesus Lord, I'm charmed
By Your mercy
And I rejoice that You've chosen me
To be with You in eternity
But until then keep me close to Thee,
Lovely One."}
