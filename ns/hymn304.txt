{"1": "Lord, I love You:
Lord, take my heart.
Lord, saturate me.
Fill every part with Your life divine.
Lord, I now surrender all to You.
Keep me turning to You every day.
Until I'm expressing only You always.
Until I'm expressing only You.",
"2": "Lord, keep us burning;
Make us Your counterpart.
Lord, saturate us;
Fill every part with Your life divine.
Lord, we now surrender all to You.
Keep us turning to You every day,
Until we're expressing only You, always;
Until we're expressing only You."}
