{"chorus": "I beseech you brothers as a pris'ner in the Lord,
To walk worthily of your calling,
The calling with which you were called,
With all lowliness and meekness,
With long-suffering,
Bearing one another in love,
Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit
In the uniting bond of peace.

The calling with which you were called,
With all lowliness and meekness,
With long-suffering,
Bearing one another in love,
Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit
In the uniting bond of peace.",
"chorus": "One Body and one Spirit,
Even as also you were called in one hope,
One hope of your calling;
One Lord, one faith, one baptism;
One God and one Father of all,
Who is over all and through all and in all.

One hope of your calling;
One Lord, one faith, one baptism;
One God and one Father of all,
Who is over all and through all and in all."}
