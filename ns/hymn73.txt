{"chorus": "Trust in Jehovah with all your heart,
Do not rely on your own understanding.
In all your ways acknowledge Him,
And He will make your paths straight.
O the depth of the riches
And wisdom and knowledge of God!
How unsearchable are His judgments
And untraceable His ways!
Because out from Him and through Him
And to Him are all things.
To Him be the glory forever. Amen."}
