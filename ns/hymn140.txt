I love You, Lord above.
I give myself to You right now,
Lord, You alone I love.",

Your blood, You shed for me.
The right of ownership o'er me
Has been transferred to Thee.",
"3": "Lord, thank You I am sacrificed
Upon the altar of love;
Unto You I am set apart,
I love You, Lord above.",
"4": "I consecrate myself to You,
I give myself to You.
Work in me fully that I may
Be useful Lord, to You.",
"5": "Lord, I give You my whole future,
I bind myself to You.
I cut all ties with worldly things,
I yield myself to You."}
