["1 Lord Jesus, draw me one step further;\nDraw me, Lord from where I am.\nI've been here too long already.\nMove me, Lord, I know You can.", "2 Your whisper, Lord, so softly sounding,\nDeep within my heart does burn.\nLet Your stillness now subdue me\nThat Your feeling I discern.", "3 All idle thoughts and impure feelings,\nLord, remove from mind and heart.\nWash me in the crystal water\nAnd more life to me impart.", "4 All hidden things that block my vision,\nRocks of self-ambition, pride;\nNow expose and burn away, Lord\nBy Your look intensified.", "5 Increase the weight of glory in me,\nLet Your Spirit now transform,\nThat all things would not be wasted\nBut would work to save me more.", "6 Lord Jesus, oh how much I need You!\nThank You, Lord, that You are here,\nEver present as the Body.\nI would always seek You there."]
