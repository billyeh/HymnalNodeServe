{"1": "Lord Jesus, draw me one step further;
Draw me, Lord from where I am.
I've been here too long already.
Move me, Lord, I know You can.",
"2": "Your whisper, Lord, so softly sounding,
Deep within my heart does burn.
Let Your stillness now subdue me
That Your feeling I discern.",
"3": "All idle thoughts and impure feelings,
Lord, remove from mind and heart.
Wash me in the crystal water
And more life to me impart.",
"4": "All hidden things that block my vision,
Rocks of self-ambition, pride;
Now expose and burn away, Lord
By Your look intensified.",
"5": "Increase the weight of glory in me,
Let Your Spirit now transform,
That all things would not be wasted
But would work to save me more.",
"6": "Lord Jesus, oh how much I need You!
Thank You, Lord, that You are here,
Ever present as the Body.
I would always seek You there."}
