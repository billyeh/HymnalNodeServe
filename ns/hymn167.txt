{"1": "I always knew deep down in me
There was a longing to be free,
A kind of hunger deep inside-
To fill it up, I tried and tried.
There were a lot of things I had;
Some things were good,
Some things were bad.
But all those things of mine before
Don't satisfy me anymore.",
"chorus": "Now life affords a real reward
Whenever I just call "O Lord!"
The Triune God the Spirit is,
And He can fill mine up with His.",
"2": "Thank You, Lord Jesus, for the wine
That I enjoy as life divine.
I thank You, Lord, for mercy all
That opened me to heed Your call.
O Lord, now make Your home my heart
And fully saturate each part.
O Lord, my words just can't express
The way You've filled my emptiness!",
"chorus": "O Lord, I know that You will grow
And from my spirit overflow.
Lord, saturate me through and through-
O Lord Jesus, I love You.",
"3": "I always knew deep down in me
There was a longing to be free.
A kind of hunger deep inside-
But now it can be satisfied...
Christ in my heart-the only way
To spread within me day by day.
Lord Jesus! Lord, I have to say
You're home in me and home to stay!",
"chorus": "O Lord, I know now You will grow
And from my spirit overflow!
Now saturate me through and through!
O Lord Jesus, I love You!
O Lord Jesus, I love You!
O Lord Jesus, I love You!"}
