{"1": "I wake up this morning, Lord;
The sun shines through my windowsill.
How can I help but praise Your name!
You're my Lord and King!",
"chorus": "Because You...gave Your life up for me.
The Spirit...You were raised to be.
Now You are...living deep in me,
As my hope of glory.",
"2": "Each day Your mercies they are new,
To me refreshing as the dew;
You are my bountiful supply.
Every morning You're nigh!",
"3": "For me You came from up above,
Because You are the God of love;
Your love will never let me go;
Everyday it flows.",
"4": "Your love flows out to me as grace,
Enabling me to run the race;
As truth You're my reality,
As my all to be.",
"5": "As I walk on this pilgrim road,
My flesh and self You will erode;
In my heart, You will have Your way;
Take more room each day.",
"6": "Each day the world I leave behind;
You write Your laws upon my mind,
Inscribing on my softened heart,
Filling every part.",
"7": "O Lord, I'm just a tree in You,
Rooted and being built in You,
Absorbing all You are to me,
What a place to be!"}
