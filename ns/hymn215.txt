["1 I wake up this morning, Lord;\nThe sun shines through my windowsill.\nHow can I help but praise Your name!\nYou're my Lord and King!", "chorus Because You...gave Your life up for me.\nThe Spirit...You were raised to be.\nNow You are...living deep in me,\nAs my hope of glory.", "2 Each day Your mercies they are new,\nTo me refreshing as the dew;\nYou are my bountiful supply.\nEvery morning You're nigh!", "3 For me You came from up above,\nBecause You are the God of love;\nYour love will never let me go;\nEveryday it flows.", "4 Your love flows out to me as grace,\nEnabling me to run the race;\nAs truth You're my reality,\nAs my all to be.", "5 As I walk on this pilgrim road,\nMy flesh and self You will erode;\nIn my heart, You will have Your way;\nTake more room each day.", "6 Each day the world I leave behind;\nYou write Your laws upon my mind,\nInscribing on my softened heart,\nFilling every part.", "7 O Lord, I'm just a tree in You,\nRooted and being built in You,\nAbsorbing all You are to me,\nWhat a place to be!"]
