{"1": "O my God, within Thee there is eternal life
And this life is expressed in the Son
He has risen, today, as the Spirit of life
Which in us quickens us, gives us life.",
"2": "O behold, from the throne of our God and the Lamb
Flows a river of water of life
God the source, Christ the fount, God the Spirit the flow,
Springing up as a river of life.",
"3": "Jesus Lord, from my spirit I turn unto Thee
Open wide, call Thy name, drink Thee in;
Dearest Lord, to this stream I outpour utterly;
Triune God, flow as life, flood my being."}
