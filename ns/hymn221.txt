{"1": "More of our heart, dear Lord, we'd give You now;
Even more ground to You, Lord, we'd allow.
All that distracts us we'd despise,
All that draws away our eyes-
Lord, do fill our vision
'Til the morning star has risen!
We would count all things loss, but Jesus gain;
Our inward parts cry out for You to reign.
Worthy You are our heart to claim-
Come, engrave on us Your name,
We would love You, Jesus, more.",
"2": "Less we would argue, Lord, and go our way;
More we would say "Amen" to what You say.
Grant us a walk to You conformed,
'Til our living is transformed.
We adore You, Jesus-
May a pure love for You seize us.
Any unwillingness, Lord, quickly slay;
Even by faith we open all the way-
Rising to heights of love unknown,
Christ our destiny alone,
We would love You, Jesus, more!"}
