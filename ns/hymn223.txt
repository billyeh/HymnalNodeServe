{"1": "We are the generation
The Lord has waited for.
He has sought us and pursued us.
When we touched Him, He renewed us.
Now the time has come
For all the young
To be in touch with Him!",
"2": "God loves this generation-
He chose us for His plan.
We were young and disillusioned
In the age of mass confusion.
Now we are His choice,
We all rejoice-
To God we say "Amen."",
"chorus": "Once we were searching,
Always worrying-
When would we end our search?
Now we're reborn;
Our veils are torn,
Since He brought us into the church!",
"3": "At last our search has ended;
Our praises fill the air.
We're the chosen generation!
Jesus loves this generation!
And the time has come
For all the young
To be in love with Him!"}
