["1 It is not a message that I've heard, (Just the Christ, in the word,)\nNot some points that I've learned, (The Christ in all I've heard,)\nNot a song or verse I know by heart, (But Christ in every song or verse,)\nThat can meet your need, or wash your feet, (Christ can meet your need,)\nTouch your heart, or fill the void,\nBut it's Christ, just the Christ, (Just this Christ,)\nThat I've enjoyed. (Just this Christ enjoyed.)", "2 It is nothing good that is of myself, (Just the Christ, in you and me,)\nNothing of my natural life, (The Christ who's all to be,)\nNot the best of fruit from the knowledge tree, (Only Christ we'd know,)\nThat can touch your life, or turn your heart, (Christ can touch your life,)\nRefresh you in your deepest part,\nBut it's Christ, just the Christ, (Just this Christ,)\nLived out through me. (Just the Christ in me.)"]
