{"1": "The Lord is my light and salvation;
Whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength of my life;
Of whom shall I be afraid?",
"2": "One thing have I desired of the Lord,
That will I seek;
That I may dwell in the house of the Lord
All the days of my life,
To behold the beauty of the Lord,
And to inquire in His temple.",
"3": "Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice;
Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
When thou saidst, seek ye my face;
My heart said unto thee,
Thy face, O Lord, will I seek.",
"4": "Wait on the Lord;
Be of good courage,
And He shall strengthen thine heart;
Wait, I say on the Lord.
Wait, I say on the Lord."}
