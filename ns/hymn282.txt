["1 The Lord is my light and salvation;\nWhom shall I fear?\nThe Lord is the strength of my life;\nOf whom shall I be afraid?", "2 One thing have I desired of the Lord,\nThat will I seek;\nThat I may dwell in the house of the Lord\nAll the days of my life,\nTo behold the beauty of the Lord,\nAnd to inquire in His temple.", "3 Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice;\nHave mercy also upon me, and answer me.\nWhen thou saidst, seek ye my face;\nMy heart said unto thee,\nThy face, O Lord, will I seek.", "4 Wait on the Lord;\nBe of good courage,\nAnd He shall strengthen thine heart;\nWait, I say on the Lord.\nWait, I say on the Lord."]
