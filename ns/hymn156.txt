I desire You;
No pleasure, prospects on this earth compare to You.

To love and follow You.",

I pursue You;
No person, object in this life can e'er match You.

In heaven but You;
There's none on earth
I desire but You;
I give my heart,
Lord, now to You;
Lord make me a drink off'ring here
To satisfy You."}
