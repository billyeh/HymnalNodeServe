{"1": "I've got a river of life flowing within me;
It makes the lame to walk and the blind to see.
It opens prison doors, sets the captives free.
I've got a river of life flowing within me.",
"chorus": "Spring up, O well, within my spirit!
Rise up and tell, so all can hear it!
Spring up, O well, so I experience
That life abundantly.",
"2": "I've got a river of life flowing within me;
It started gushing up when God set me free.
That I keep the flow is my only plea.
I've got a river of life springing within me.",
"3": "Once I call His name there's a flow within;
It turns me from my day, makes Him Lord again.
As my spirit burns, Satan cannot win.
Calling, "Oh Lord Jesus," keeps the flow within."}
