{"1": "In this godless age
Lord, You need some Samuels
Burdened with a vision clear of Your economy
Where's Your ark today?
And the ones who'd care for You,
E'en to put themselves aside to gain Your heart's desire?",
"chorus": "Raise up some to meet Your need, some Nazarites,
Prophets, priests, and judges, and men of prayer,
Speaking forth Your word, with Your authority,
A photo of Your heart for Your move.",
"2": "Train us up today,
Full of vision, seeking You,
We'd await Your timing, fully subject to Your will,
Treasuring Your face,
Staying in Your presence, Lord;
E'en the very index of Your eye would we obey.",
"chorus": "Raise up some to meet Your need, some Nazarites,
To bring in Your kingdom on earth today,
Taking You as King that You might return
To usher in the end of the age.",
"3": "When God wants to move,
He must gain an instrument;
Overcomers separated from the current age.
They have joined themselves
Through His word to His desire.
Overcomers constituted with the Holy Word.",
"chorus": "Raise up some to meet Your need, some Nazarites,
Voluntary consecrated ones,
Who through Your word are joined to Your desire;
Your living testimony on the earth.",
"4": "God needs men who pray;
Those who lay the tracks for Him;
God's economy is carried out through men of prayer.
They love not themselves;
But a willing sacrifice.
What they fear-offending God, losing His presence dear.",
"chorus": "Make us those who meet Your need, the Nazarites.
Make us those through whom You'd close this age;
Who are one with You to bring the kingdom in,
Young people absolute for Your move."}
