{"1": "The law of the Lord is perfect,
Converting the soul;
The testimony of the Lord is sure,
Making wise the simple.",
"chorus": "More to be desired are they than gold.
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey
And the honeycomb.",
"2": "The statues of the Lord are right,
Rejoicing the heart:
The commandment of the Lord is pure,
Enlightening the eyes.",
"3": "The fear of the Lord is clean,
Enduring forever;
The judgments of the Lord are true
And righteous altogether.",
"4": "Let the words of my mouth
And the meditation of my heart,
Be acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord,
My strength, and my redeemer.",
"chorus": "Moreover by them is Thy servant warned:
Is Thy servant warned:
And in keeping of them there is
Great reward."}
