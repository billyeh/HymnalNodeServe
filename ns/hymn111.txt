{"1": "There's a gospel of today
That says believe and you'll be saved and then
You can go to heaven and see the pearly gates
And walk the golden streets;
Words like these fail to treat
All the vanity that is hidden in me.",
"2": "But the gospel is to me
The Triune God within humanity
As the Spirit reaching me to be in me
The one reality;
Love untold-Gospel theme
Never getting old-story told eternally.",
"3": "Left the ninety-nine behind-
You searched until the lost sheep You did find,
Laid me on Your shoulders there, You bore me in
Your tender loving care;
Rejoicing-You found me
Though a small lost sheep-You gave all to come find me.",
"4": "Sweeping in my deepest parts,
You lit a lamp and searched my inward heart,
Sanctifying deep within You shined in me,
Exposed me of my sin;
Repenting-now I see
Lord, You're sprinkling me-with the blood You shed for me.",
"5": "Eagerly awaiting me
That I the slightest turn to Thee would make
Though my life had been a wreck, You ran to me
And fell upon my neck
Kissing me, affectionately;
Killed the calf for me-"Let us eat and be merry.""}
