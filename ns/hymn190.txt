{"1": "I want to be filled
with the Triune God.
He makes me happy;
I want to be filled with Him.
(Repeat)",
"chorus": "So I will drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
that living water,
And I will eat, eat, eat, eat, eat
the tree of life,
And I will call upon His name,
O Lord Jesus!
'cause I want to be filled
up, up, up
Oh, I want to be filled
up, up, up
Yes, I want to be filled
up, up, up with Him."}
