["chorus O that Christ may make His home my heart,\nSpread Himself in every part!\nSaturate and life impart!\nThat with all saints, I may apprehend\nAll the vast dimensions of my loving Christ.", "1 Father God, forgive me if I groan;\nFor so long I've been on a plateau.\nNow with tears, I bow my knees and pray\nBy Your Spirit make my spirit strong today.", "2 As I came this morning to Your word\nWith no strength to even read a verse;\nYet my plea, is \"Lord, I do need You!\"\nHow You strengthen me, Your power within to prove.", "3 I myself was losing heart each day;\nThen the Lord brought some saints my own way;\nI alone could not Thee apprehend\nBut with all the saints You now my joy have been.", "4 All these years I've come the church to know,\nYet O Lord, there're things I can't let go;\nYet within me there is an \"Amen\";\nO now joy I never knew in me's flowin'."]
