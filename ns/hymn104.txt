{"chorus": "O that Christ may make His home my heart,
Spread Himself in every part!
Saturate and life impart!
That with all saints, I may apprehend
All the vast dimensions of my loving Christ.",
"1": "Father God, forgive me if I groan;
For so long I've been on a plateau.
Now with tears, I bow my knees and pray
By Your Spirit make my spirit strong today.",
"2": "As I came this morning to Your word
With no strength to even read a verse;
Yet my plea, is "Lord, I do need You!"
How You strengthen me, Your power within to prove.",
"3": "I myself was losing heart each day;
Then the Lord brought some saints my own way;
I alone could not Thee apprehend
But with all the saints You now my joy have been.",
"4": "All these years I've come the church to know,
Yet O Lord, there're things I can't let go;
Yet within me there is an "Amen";
O now joy I never knew in me's flowin'."}
