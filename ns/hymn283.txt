{"chorus": "I am crucified with Christ
And it is no longer I who liveth,
But it is Christ who lives in me;
And the life which I now live
In the flesh, I live in faith-
The faith in the Son of God
Who loved and gave Himself up for me.",
"1": "And now I'm walking by the Spirit
Step by step, day by day,
O Lord, I love You.
You're the precious One to me.
As I do this and that
Lord, remind me where You're at;
You're in my spirit,
Dispensing grace to me.",
"2": "And now I'm walking by the Spirit,
Marching on toward the goal.
O Lord, Your purpose
Means everything to me.
All self-love I lay aside
For the churches, for Your Bride,
For the fulfillment
Of Your economy."}
