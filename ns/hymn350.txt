{"1": "O Lord, we'd know Your heart today,
You'd gain a Bride who will not sway;
One seeking only after You,
Whose heart, whose mind, whose will, whose goal
Is always ever true.",
"2": "O Lord, just make us such a one:
A Bride well-pleasing in the Son.
One to satisfy Your heart;
O we would fill Thy longing, Lord,
As Thy sweet counterpart.",
"3": "O Lord, do capture every thought,
Your mind in ours would be inwrought;
Grant us to see Your economy
Until that glorious day, dear Lord,
When You'd be all we see.",
"4": "O Lord, grant us the strength to say,
Our will is Yours in every way;
You'd move through us to all the earth,
To show the nations Your unbounded,
Everlasting worth.",
"5": "O Lord, this would be our life's goal:
You'd saturate our very soul;
O Lord we're crying out to You,
Make us Your overcoming Bride, 
And see Your purpose through."}
