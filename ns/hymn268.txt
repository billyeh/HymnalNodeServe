{"nonum": "Search me, O God, and know my heart;
Try me and know my thoughts;
And see if there be any wicked way in me;
Lead me in the way, lead me in the way,
Lead me in the way everlasting.",
"nonum": "You have searched me;
You have known me;
My downsitting, my uprising;
You understand my thoughts from afar;
You know all my ways,
You know all my ways.
(Two parts can be sung simultaneously)"}
