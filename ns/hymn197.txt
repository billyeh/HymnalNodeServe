{"1": "Lord, You are my only goal!
You're my only hope!
I only care for You!
I never could replace You,
And I would never want to.
I have everything, Lord-
I have You!",
"2": "Lord, I only live for You-
Not anything else!
In everything You're my source;
No more good intentions,
No more right or wrong.
I don't want a "good" life-
I want You!"}
