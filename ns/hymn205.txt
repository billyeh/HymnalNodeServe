{"1": "Nothing can content me more,
Than Jesus in the morning,
Echoing the hallways of my heart.
My eyes from darkness clearly see,
The love within His smile, for me.
It's then I know the reason for my life.",
"chorus": "Jesus, You're my reason for being here,
Oh, it's so clear; so I sing!",
"2": "No greater joy can be for me,
Than turning to Jesus,
When the shadows of the day begin to haunt me.
His soft, warm Spirit spreads throughout,
Quenching all my fear and doubt.
Jesus is the all-inclusive love.",
"note": "(Repeat verse 2)"}
