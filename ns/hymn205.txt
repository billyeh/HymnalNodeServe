["1 Nothing can content me more,\nThan Jesus in the morning,\nEchoing the hallways of my heart.\nMy eyes from darkness clearly see,\nThe love within His smile, for me.\nIt's then I know the reason for my life.", "chorus Jesus, You're my reason for being here,\nOh, it's so clear; so I sing!", "2 No greater joy can be for me,\nThan turning to Jesus,\nWhen the shadows of the day begin to haunt me.\nHis soft, warm Spirit spreads throughout,\nQuenching all my fear and doubt.\nJesus is the all-inclusive love.", "note (Repeat verse 2)"]
