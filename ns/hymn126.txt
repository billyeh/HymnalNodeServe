{"1": "Therefore being justified by faith
We have peace with God
Through our Lord Jesus Christ",
"chorus": "Because the love of God is shed abroad
In our hearts, by the Holy Spirit
Which is given, which is given
Unto us, to us, to us.",
"2": "God hath commended His love toward us
In that while we were yet sinners
Christ died for us."}
