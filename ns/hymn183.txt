{"1": "Christ is a genuine man,
The perfect and finest man,
Obedient, serving, no appearance of evil,
The finest personality,
Divinity expressed through humanity.",
"2": "Christ is the pattern for our human living.
His perfect life is filling us.
Christ is the pattern for our human living,
The fine and balanced humanity of Jesus!
(Repeat 1st stanza)"}
