{"1": "God has called us for His purpose,
His economy so glorious,
For which He was fully processed;
Consummated now is He!
As the Spirit, He indwells us;
As our God alloted portion,
Working out His full salvation,
Making us the same as He is.",
"chorus": "Oh, may a clear, controlling vision of
The Lord's economy direct my heart,
And burn in me until my spirit's wholly set afire!
With spirit strong and active we'll press on
To consummate God's goal-
New Jerusalem, Hallelujah!",
"2": "Jesus lived the God-man pattern,
Set the way for us to follow,
He denied His natural man and 
Was obedient unto death,
Once He was the only God-man;
Now we are His duplication.
As the many grains we're blended
As His corporate reproduction.",
"3": "Living out His resurrection,
Dying to the flesh and soul-life.
Living by the mingled spirit,
Natural man we will deny.
Now we're living in the Body,
Every day we're overcoming,
Striving for the peak of Zion,
Watching for our Lord's appearing.",
"4": "God and man will have one living,
Always in the mingled spirit;
We two are incorporated 
One organic entity!
This the vision of the ages
Will control our daily living
That the Lord may have His Body
Shining as the holy city."}
