["1 The goal of God's complete salvation\nIs to make His redeemed people\nHis dwelling place on earth\nThat they may fellowship with God, serve God\nAnd be God's holy people living a holy life\nThrough the tabernacle with the offerings, and by the priests-\nAll types of the all-inclusive Christ-\nTo issue in the gaining of Christ as their mutual rest\nAnd enjoyment typified by the feasts."]
