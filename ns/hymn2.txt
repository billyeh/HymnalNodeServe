{"1": "The goal of God's complete salvation
Is to make His redeemed people
His dwelling place on earth
That they may fellowship with God, serve God
And be God's holy people living a holy life
Through the tabernacle with the offerings, and by the priests-
All types of the all-inclusive Christ-
To issue in the gaining of Christ as their mutual rest
And enjoyment typified by the feasts."}
