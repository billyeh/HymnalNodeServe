For the Bible tells me so.
Incarnated as a man,
Lived and died and raised again.",
"chorus": "Yes, God is processed,
Now He's the Spirit
To constitute us
With the processed Triune God.",

Crucifixion: "terminates,
Resurrection: "germinates,
Life divine now animates.",
"3": "Incarnated so He can
Have the living of a man.
Crucified and raised that He
Could impart His life to me."}
