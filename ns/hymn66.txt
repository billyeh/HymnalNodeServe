{"1": "Arise! Arise! And open up your heart,
Christ will come in and life to you impart.
As the Spirit He is now our bountiful supply
And all our need His life will satisfy.",
"2": "Arise! Arise! And open up your mouth,
Join in the praise and let your spirit out.
He is rich unto all those who call upon His name;
Together now His riches we proclaim."}
