["1 Arise! Arise! And open up your heart,\nChrist will come in and life to you impart.\nAs the Spirit He is now our bountiful supply\nAnd all our need His life will satisfy.", "2 Arise! Arise! And open up your mouth,\nJoin in the praise and let your spirit out.\nHe is rich unto all those who call upon His name;\nTogether now His riches we proclaim."]
