{"chorus": "Draw me, dear Lord.
Draw me today.
From everything else, dear Lord,
Draw me away.",
"1": "O Lord, this whole world
Seems to weigh me down.
All the cares, the strife the sin,
Within me and all around.",
"2": "But, Lord, I want to set my heart,
And, Lord, I want to stay with You.
'Cause only when You're near to me
Is everything okay.",
"3": "And though everything may fall apart
Or everything go my way,
It doesn't really matter, Lord,
As long as I gain You today."}
