{"chorus": "Christ is everything, I need Him.
He is everything you need, believe Him.
Life is a person, receive Him,
Open up your heart and sing.",
"1": "Open yourself to the new creation.
Open your eyes to the joy of change.
Life is a fruit of God's creation.
Every new birth is a soul regained.",
"2": "Drinking His life from a silver fountain.
Sweet water running inside of me.
Oh, how I love to live on the mountain,
Ever since Jesus set me free.",
"3": "Follow the Lord like a charging stallion.
Race for the Son with all your might.
Guard your heart like a gold medallion,
Keep the kingdom full in sight."}
