{"1": "He grew up like a tender plant-
The Son of God,
And like a root out of dry ground-
No attracting form
Nor majesty.",
"2": "He alone bore the sin of man,
To save me
And poured out His life unto death;
The Lamb of God,
Oh Jesus Christ!",
"chorus": "Surely He has borne our sicknesses
And carried our sorrows.
He made Himself an offering,
An offering for sin.
He was crushed because of our iniquities
And by His stripes we've been healed.
He will see the fruit of the travail of His soul.
The righteous One will make the many righteous."}
