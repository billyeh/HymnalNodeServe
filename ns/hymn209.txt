["1 Lord, now I see,\nYou only want me to believe\nNot to change.\nIn all my failures and defeats\nTo believe what You have done,\nAnd not in what I see.", "2 Lord I believe,\nWhen all around me is defeat\nAnd it seems that nothing's changing outwardly.\nNo! I'm not discouraged,\nI'm believing You.", "3 Yes, I believe,\nAnd there is no demand on me.\nSimple faith, yes, that is all You want from me.\nFreed from anxious doubting-\nI'm free to just believe!", "4 Believing You,\nBecause, Lord, You are my success!\nWhen I fail, all I must do is just confess,\nAnd go on enjoying You-\nI love believing You!"]
