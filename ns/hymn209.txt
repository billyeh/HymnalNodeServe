{"1": "Lord, now I see,
You only want me to believe
Not to change.
In all my failures and defeats
To believe what You have done,
And not in what I see.",
"2": "Lord I believe,
When all around me is defeat
And it seems that nothing's changing outwardly.
No! I'm not discouraged,
I'm believing You.",
"3": "Yes, I believe,
And there is no demand on me.
Simple faith, yes, that is all You want from me.
Freed from anxious doubting-
I'm free to just believe!",
"4": "Believing You,
Because, Lord, You are my success!
When I fail, all I must do is just confess,
And go on enjoying You-
I love believing You!"}
