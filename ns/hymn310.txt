{"1": "Once again a new beginning,
Yesterday I've put behind,
To You Lord I come in seeking,
For Your Words, bring them to mind.
Oh Lord, grant me Your rich speaking,
Cause my spirit filled to be,
Lord, my heart and thoughts transforming,
That my life I live by Thee.",
"2": "Lord, today I give unto Thee,
Saturate me, capture me,
Shine upon me, burn within me,
Purge my darkness, sin in me.
Free from every fetter, burden,
Joy in choosing all Your ways,
Keeping to the path You've trodden,
I'll submit to You always."}
