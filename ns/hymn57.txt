{"1": "Have you found your human spirit?
It's connected to your mouth!",
"Hallelujah, O Lord Jesus!"
That's the way to let it out.",
"chorus": "What is born of God is our human spirit-
Praise God, the job has been done!
What is born of Spirit is just our spirit,
And the two spirits are one.",
"2": "Don't wait for an inspiration-
That's the subtle enemy.
Open up! Release your spirit,
Testifying you are free."}
