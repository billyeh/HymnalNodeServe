{"1": "God's love: "long, broad, high, and deep,
Indeed beyond measure;
Else how could such a sinner as me,
Be with bountiful grace favored.",
"2": "My Lord paid a price so great,
To buy me back to Him;
Now willing I'm the cross to bear,
And follow Him to the end.",
"3": "I now have forsaken all,
In order Christ to gain;
Or life, or death, unworthy a thought,
Not even one backward glance!",
"4": "Loved ones, desires, wealth and fame,
To me what good are they?
My Lord for me poor and woe became,
For Him I'd be poor today.",
"5": "I love my Savior Lord,
I only long for His "Yes";
For Him no ease can comfort hold,
All gains a loss became.",
"6": "You are my true comfort,
My gracious Lord Jesus;
Whom but You have I in heaven?
What else I love on earth?",
"7": "Suffer, opposed, tossed around,
Hence I will all disregard;
Only I'd ask my Lord with Your love,
Spirit, soul, and body surround.",
"8": "O Lord, I now beseech You,
Guide me in grace onward;
Stand by and strengthen me all way through,
To pass this dark, evil world.",
"9": "Satan, the world, and the flesh,
Oft'n tempt and humiliate;
If You don't add me with more strength
I may Your name disgrace!",
"10": "Now time is running short,
Set me free, O Lord, I pray;
Once You return, I'll sing with joy,
Hallelujah! Amen!"}
