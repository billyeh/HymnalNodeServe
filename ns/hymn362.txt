["1 Lord, for this day, thankful to You,\nI give myself to be joined to You anew.\nYou're the living water,\nSatisfies me ever,\nFills my spirit, in me spreads, and\nFloods me till life's fully manifest.", "2 No need for doubt or anxious care,\nJust seek His kingdom and righteousness fore'er.\nDaily needs compelling,\nAll to Him I'm telling,\nAnd His peace, so rich and deep,\nPreserves me safe and keeps me constantly.", "3 Always rejoice, ceaselessly pray,\nIn all give thanks, 'tis the all-excelling way.\nChrist's the living fountain,\nMy supply abundant,\nAll to His hand I entrust, and\nHe'll preserve and keep me to the end."]
