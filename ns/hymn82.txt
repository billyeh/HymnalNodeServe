{"1": "I once was dead-dead in my sins;
Behaved myself in lust of flesh.
By nature such a child of wrath,
Even as the rest.",
"2": "But God being so merciful
Because of His great love to me
Enlivened me I'm now in Christ
Seated in the heavenlies.",
"3": "But that's not all! I'm with the saints.
Together we're His workmanship,
His masterpiece expressing Him
In the heavens and on earth.",
"4": "I was once apart from Christ, you know;
Alien from the wealth of Israel;
Not a hope-not even one to tell,
Without God in the world.",
"5": "Now in Christ He has become my peace;
By the blood of Christ I am released.
I am one with all the saints, since He's
Broken down the middle wall.",
"6": "He has died creating one new man.
Thus fulfilling God's eternal plan.
With all saints together, let us stand,
Shout and sing and praise the Lord!"}
