{"1": "In the church life we can see
We are God's own family.
As we blend with the saints
We are built up in love,
His expression thus to be.",
"chorus": "In the church we are home;
Here our joy has begun.
In this sweet fellowship
We are built up in love
As the many, yet as one.",
"2": "In each member we can see
Our God in humanity;
As each functions in life,
Christ is then manifest
Through His Body practic'ly.",
"3": "As we gather we can see
One expression, corp'rately;
As His Body on earth,
Now Christ's riches we share
In the church life, heavenly!"}
