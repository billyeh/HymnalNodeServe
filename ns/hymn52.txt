["1 Are you the One who came from heav'n?\nThe mighty God who suffered the curse of sin and died,\nAnd they pierced Your side.\nRose from the grave, You're ever new;\nYou've sown in me the seed of life that grew\nFrom sinner, poor and blind\nTo New Jerusalem.", "chorus I love You more\nWith all my heart, with all my soul,\n(Oh, Love divine)\nWith all my strength, with all my mind;\nSweet, sweet repose.", "2 Are You the One my heart has known?\nAre You the One, my spirit has richly grown to love?\nOh come, Beloved\nAnd with my lips, shall I confess\nThat deep in You my heart found rest\nAnd peace as ocean's depth?\nOh, fill me with Your breath!"]
