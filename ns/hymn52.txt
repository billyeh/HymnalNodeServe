{"1": "Are you the One who came from heav'n?
The mighty God who suffered the curse of sin and died,
And they pierced Your side.
Rose from the grave, You're ever new;
You've sown in me the seed of life that grew
From sinner, poor and blind
To New Jerusalem.",
"chorus": "I love You more
With all my heart, with all my soul,
(Oh, Love divine)
With all my strength, with all my mind;
Sweet, sweet repose.",
"2": "Are You the One my heart has known?
Are You the One, my spirit has richly grown to love?
Oh come, Beloved
And with my lips, shall I confess
That deep in You my heart found rest
And peace as ocean's depth?
Oh, fill me with Your breath!"}
