{"1": "Your sweetness is just a taste of enjoyment.
Your beauty is simply my heart's attraction.
Your radiance has captured me.
Your eyes draw things out of me.
I want to daily kiss You and hold on to You.",
"chorus": "O Jesus, I'm crazy loving You.
O Jesus, I'm crazy loving You.
O Jesus, I'm crazy loving You
Until myself is no more.
O Jesus, I'm crazy loving You.
O Jesus, I'm crazy loving You.
O Jesus, I'm crazy loving You
'Til I'm lost in You.",
"2": "Forgetting all that I'm outwardly doing.
Forgetting all of my thoughts of improving.
You only want to be loved,
I give my love unto You;
A crazy lover of Christ, I'm jumping for joy.",
"3": "Yes, my life's just to love You with my whole being.
Yes, my work's just to love You with my whole being.
Loving You is my pleasure,
Loving You is my service,
Loving You is my motive and also my will.",
"4": "O my Love, You've blinded me towards all things.
O my Love, You make the world simply nothing.
Just let me see You alone,
Just make me need You alone;
None other is there for me, it's Jesus alone!"}
