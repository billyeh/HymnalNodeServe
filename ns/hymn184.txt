["1 To be baptized in the Spirit\nIs to get into the Spirit\nAnd to be lost in Him.\nTo drink of the Spirit\nIs to take the Spirit in\nAnd have our being saturated with Him.\nBy these two procedures\nWe are mingled with the Spirit.\nTo be baptized in the Spirit\nIs the initiation of the mingling\nAnd is once for all.\nTo drink the Spirit\nIs the accomplishment of the mingling\nAnd is perpetual forever."]
