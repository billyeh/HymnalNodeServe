{"1": "To be baptized in the Spirit
Is to get into the Spirit
And to be lost in Him.
To drink of the Spirit
Is to take the Spirit in
And have our being saturated with Him.
By these two procedures
We are mingled with the Spirit.
To be baptized in the Spirit
Is the initiation of the mingling
And is once for all.
To drink the Spirit
Is the accomplishment of the mingling
And is perpetual forever."}
