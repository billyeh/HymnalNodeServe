{"1": "The faith is the economy, the economy of God
The household administration, the dispensing of our God
The truth is the contents, the reality of the faith,
According to God's economy.",
"chorus": "Godliness is a living that expresses
The divine reality,
An expression of God in all His riches;
His Body corporately.",
"2": "Healthy teaching, words, and speaking
Are the ministry of the truth,
Ministering into people the reality of these truths;
Eternal life is the means and the power to carry out,
The divine realities of the faith;",
"3": "Faith is the response to the truth of the faith
Conscience is a test and a check to preserve us in the faith.
The faith is the economy, the economy of God,
The household administration, the dispensing of our God;",
"4": "The faith, the truth, expressed in healthy words,
Carried out in power by His life
Expressed in Godly living responded to by faith,
Kept and held in check by our conscience."}
