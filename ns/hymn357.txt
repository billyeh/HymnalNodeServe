{"1": "Lord, I love You, I'm charmed by You.
I open my whole being to be infused by You.
Lord, do whatever You have to do in me
To make me what You need.
Lord, make my heart a duplication of
Your heart in every possible way.
O Lord, do something in me for You,
And keep my heart single for You.
Lord, I love You."}
