{"1": "Here we are gathered, one family in the Lord;
His life is the bond that we share.
Although we are many, we are in one accord,
And as the members, know the family care.",
"chorus": "And blending with the saints we know,
Our joy has just begun;
We blend together and we blend as one.
And blending with the saints we know,
The building has begun;
We build together and we build as one.",
"2": "When we're together our joy is made so full;
The love of the Lord fills our hearts,
And we all partake of the Spirit bountiful.
We've found, here in the family life, a part.",
"3": "Here we will stay, Lord, according to Your plan,
For here in the church life we're one;
And we will be built up to be the corp'rate man
To consummate the New Jerusalem."}
