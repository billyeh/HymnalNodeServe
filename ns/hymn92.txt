{"1": "We'd experience Christ daily,
Him we would constantly pursue.
Our pursuing has a purpose
To build His Body is our view.",
"chorus": "Occupy us for Your Body.
Grace supplying, You afford.
Always bearing, always caring,
By Your grace we'd be outpoured.",
"2": "Grant us, Lord, a willing spirit.
To build Your Body we would strive.
By our measure we would function,
Until full grown we'd all arrive.",
"3": "As the members of His Body,
Each one is now a life supply.
Serving Christ to one another,
In love, His Body built thereby."}
