["1 There are times and times again,\nWhen my love seems far away;\nThe hours would stretch, the days turn gray;\nAll the while, I know not how,\nIn my darkest hour, He prays\nIn the saints, oh, for my sake.", "chorus By a touch of His dear love,\nBy the sound of His sweet voice,\nWhispers from above,\nSpoken through men of clay.\nAnd this world just fades away.\n(Let this world just fade away.)", "2 Blinded soul, I cannot see\nWhat this world has done to me;\nMy heart grows cold and life would bleed;\nThen He comes, knocks on my door,\nThrough the saints-and there they stand\nWith the Lord, oh, for my need!"]
