{"1": "Jesus, Jesus our Redeemer
Has become our Jubilee,
Sent to proclaim the release
Of all held in captivity.
To the blind recovered sight-
The release of all oppressed.
To proclaim the year of the Lord,
Hallelujah Jubilee.",
"2": "Jesus, Jesus our Redeemer
Has secured our liberty,
He has freed us from our bondage
Now in His life we are free.
From the darkness to the light-
Now in Him reality.
We proclaim the year of our Lord,
Hallelujah Jubilee.",
"3": "Jesus, Jesus our Redeemer
Has restored us to the land,
He has brought us to the Father
Now fore'er to dwell in Him.
From a distant land to home-
His embrace now comforts us.
We proclaim the year of our Lord,
Hallelujah Jubilee.",
"4": "Jesus, Jesus our Redeemer
Has restored the family,
Brothers, sisters we are here now
In God's house eternally.
No more strangers from His love-
Now His children ere to be.
We proclaim the year of our Lord,
Hallelujah Jubilee."}
