{"1": "I love God because He loved me long before the world began.
I love God because He knew my destiny.
I love God because He made me part of His eternal plan.
I love God because He first loved me.",
"chorus": "I love Him for all the things He's done for me.
I love Him for all that He is, all that He is to me.
But, most of all, I love Him as the Spirit
Who deep within my spirit lives.",
"2": "I love God because He came in time to be the Son of Man.
I love God because He gave Himself for me.
I love God because He conquered death that I might live in Him.
I love God because He first loved me.",
"3": "I love God because He's processed now to be my life within.
I love God because He is transforming me.
I love God because He's building up the New Jerusalem.
I love God because He still loves me."}
