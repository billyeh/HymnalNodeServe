{"1": "To You, dear Lord,
I give myself afresh again
Unsparingly for Your desire,
Your economy.",
"2": "O, fire from above,
Come and consume me thoroughly
That You may be my all,
My life, my everything.",
"3": "It's Your mercy and Your love
That I can give myself to You.
Since it's in like manner
That You gave up Yourself for me.",
"4": "Set Your throne in my heart
From now on to the very end.
It takes eternity to know its worth
To You, to me."}
