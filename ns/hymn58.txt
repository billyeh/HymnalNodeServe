{"1": "The Bible is God's breath; the essence of His Person.
God's speaking out through man; borne by the Holy Spirit.
The Bible is God's speaking in the prophets and the Son;
The Bible is the Holy Spirit's revelation.",
"2": "The Bible testifies concerning the Lord Jesus;
The Bible makes man wise, wise unto salvation;
The Bible causes man to be regenerated;
Our spiritual milk, our bread of life;
It makes us all complete."}
