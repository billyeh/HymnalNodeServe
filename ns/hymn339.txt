{"nonum": "But holding to truth in love
We may grow up in all things
Into Him who is the Head
Christ is the Head
Out from Whom all the Body
Being joined together and
Being knit together through
Ev'ry joint of the rich supply
And through the operation
In the measure of each one part
of each one part
Causes the growth of the Body unto the
building up of itself in love,
in love, in love."}
