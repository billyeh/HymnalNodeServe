["1 There are two greatest prayers we must pray everyday,\nFor which Paul the apostle taught us in Ephesians,\nOne in chapter one and the other, chapter three,\nOne for vision and the other for experience.", "chorus Grant us spirit of wisdom and of revelation,\nStrengthen us, Lord, with power into our inner man,\nYour economy then may become our vision,\nAnd You may make home in our hearts to fulfill Your plan.", "2 We have prayed for our many concerns, worries, and plans,\nWe have prayed for our heart's desire and so many aims,\nWe have prayed for good meetings and our gospel friends,\nNow let's rise up and pray prayers that would turn this age!", "3 Two millennia have gone by Christians countless as sands,\nGod's economy yet a mystery hidden to man,\nMany zealous yet with no vision, no restraint,\nWho would kneel down and pray to see God's central vision?", "4 What's God's calling and glory of His inheritance?\nWhat's the surpassing greatness of His power fourfold?\nWhat's the transmission of Christ as Head to the church?\nWhat's His Body, His fullness while He fills all in all?", "5 To see vision we need to pray for four elements,\nWisdom to know and revelation of the objects,\nLight for illumination and our eyes opened,\nGod's economy then shall be a vision so clear.", "6 With the vision we must not be proud or be content,\nLest as Laodicea soon we lukewarm become,\nEmpty knowledge would only make you poor, blind, naked,", \"Buy gold, garments and eyesalve!\" - this' how we overcome!", "7 What're Christ's unsearchable riches Paul as gospel proclaimed?\nWhat're the breadth, length, height, depth of Christ we shall apprehend?\nWhat's the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ to know?\nWhat's to be filled with all the fullness of God fore'er?", "8 Thus we all must pursue to gain the experience,\nE'en as Mary wouldn't let go till the Lord manifest'd,\nLook how Paul ran his race to gain Christ till the end,\nLet us forget all things and press on to Christ ahead.", "9 For experience we must pray to be strengthened always,\nThat from soul into spirit we would turn and remain,\nOnly when we're in spirit can Christ have a way,\nFrom our spirit to make His home in our hearts through faith.", "10 Seeing the vision would help us walk on God-ordained way,\nBeing in spirit then God will build up His dwelling place,\nMaking home in our hearts is how Christ builds His church,\nHow His bride is prepared for Him to come end this age.", "11 Heav'nly vision must be renewed and ne'er disobeyed,\nTo experience Christ for His Body - that's all we care!\nLet's all pray these two greatest prayers day by day,\nHallelujah! We'll soon bring Him back - no more delay!"]
