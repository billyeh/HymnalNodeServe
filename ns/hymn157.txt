{"1": "We're renewed and revived by the Lord day by day;
He is grace upon grace and refreshing as dew.
Shining brighter and brighter, our path's a clear way,
As morning by morning His mercies are new.",
"2": "Transformed by beholding from glory to glory,
And from strength to strength on to Zion we go.
Constitute us with truth as daily we study-
Here a little there a little-Your Word to know.",
"3": "Perfected and nourished from house to house meeting,
We speak one by one that the church may be built.
As little by little ev'ry enemy's fleeing,
More and more surpassingly with glory we're filled.",
"chorus": "Day by day,
Grace upon grace,
Brighter and brighter,
Morning by morning
(His mercies are new.)",
"chorus": "Glory to glory,
Strength to strength,
Here a little,
There a little
(Your Word to know.)",
"chorus": "House to house,
One by one,
Little by little,
More and more
(With glory we're filled.)"}
