["chorus We have a Father\nWhose heart is full of love toward us.\nHis heart is so great\nAnd His love is so unlimited.\nEven when we sin,\nWe can always come back to Him;\nThis is our Father's great love toward us.\nWe just need to repent,\nIn His loving arms we were meant;\nThis is our Father's great love toward us."]
