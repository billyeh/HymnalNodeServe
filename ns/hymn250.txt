{"1": "The Christian life is a life,
A life of living Christ
For the constitution and building up
Of the Body of Christ;
The Christian life is a life of living Christ.",
"2": "We need to work out our own salvation
By obeying the inner operating God.
We need to be conformed to the mold of Christ's death
By the power of His resurrection that we may attain
To the out resurrection from the dead.",
"3": "The Christian life is a life,
A life full of Christ
As forbearance but without anxiety;
The Christian life is a life full of Christ."}
