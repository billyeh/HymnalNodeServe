{"1": "Incarnation
Human living
Crucifixion
Resurrection
Became Spirit
And ascended man!
God became a man
According to God's plan
To dispense Himself as life to us.
He was processed thus:
Oh, how marvelous!
Then like Him we're processed through...",
"2": "Regeneration
Sanctification
Then renewing
Transformation
Conformation
Glorification-we
Become God in life
And nature, not in Godhead
Through His organic salvation.
We are processed thus:
Oh, how glorious
To express the processed Triune God."}
