["1 Some, these days, would tell us that our Jesus is not food,\nThat we only need to know about Him and do good,\nBut we're glad to tell you brothers, it's just not that way-\nJesus is the bread of life; we eat Him every day.", "chorus We love the church life, eating,\ndrinking, breathing Jesus.\nWe love the church life, taking\nin God's Word.\nWe love to hear those \"O Lord,\nAmen, Hallelujahs!\"\nWe love the church life, feasting\nwith the Lord.", "2 When He fills our inward parts, we're never quite the same,\nSo much richness we can taste by calling on His name.", \"Services\" but once a week for us will never do.\nEvery day we need the fellowship to take us through.", "3 If these latter days and situations of the world\nMake you feel that round a vicious circle you are swirled,\nThen please listen closely to the things we have to say; \nIt may be that you will find with us a better way."]
