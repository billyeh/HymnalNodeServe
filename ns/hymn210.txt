{"1": "He understands you thoroughly;
There's nothing He does not know.
All your problems and weaknesses
Don't say it isn't so!
He's your Helper, sympathizing.
He's the Spirit. Don't neglect Him.
He's praying for you
And sustaining you.",
"2": "He gives support and comforts you,
Interceding night and day.
And when you're weak He groans for you
With words you cannot say.
He's the Spirit, interceding.
He's the Spirit. Don't neglect this
Wonderful One,
Who is praying for you.",
"3": "So many times we are so weak,
But Someone deep within
Supplies the very help we need,
And we're upheld by Him.
He says, "Don't be disappointed."
He knows all your fears and failures;
He's praying for you
As no one else can do."}
