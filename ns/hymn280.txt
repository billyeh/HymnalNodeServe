{"1": "Lord, make me to know mine end,
And the measure of my days, what it is,
That I may know how frail I am,
How frail I am.",
"2": "Behold, Thou hast made my days as an handbreadth;
And mine age is as nothing before Thee;
Verily every man at his best state,
Is altogether vanity. Selah.",
"3": "Surely every man walketh in a vain show;
Surely they are disquieted in vain;
He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not
Who shall gather them.",
"4": "And now, Lord, what wait I for?
My hope is in Thee.
Now Lord, what wait I for?
My hope is in Thee.
My hope is in Thee.
(repeat stanzas 3 and 4)"}
