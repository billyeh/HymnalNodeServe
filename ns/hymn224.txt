I've found something more:
He's better than anything
I've ever found before.
Yes, I have found the Living One,
Oh, how my spirit soars!
I called His name, I'm not the same,
I am for the Lord!",

I'm loving Jesus!
I'm for the Lord!
I'm calling O Lord Jesus!",

I've found something better:
I have found the Living One
And He breaks every fetter.
Yes, He's the One who set me free.
Oh, how my spirit soars!
I called His name, I'm not the same,
I am for the Lord!",

Yes I'm fully satisfied.
I have found the Living One,
And He lives right inside
Of you and me, so come and see
Now our spirits soar!
We called His name, we're not the same,
We are for the Lord!",
"chorus": "We're for the Lord!
We're loving Jesus!
We're for the Lord!
We're calling O Lord Jesus!"}
