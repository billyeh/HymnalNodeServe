{"1": "Lord Jesus, all our hearts You've gained,
You are the only One we love.
Lord, keep our hearts single and pure
To love You and Your church.",
"chorus": "Increase Yourself, O Lord,
Now in us, grow more and more.
And build the glorious church,
You love and have died for.
Lord, we suffer and live to You,
'Tis our glory and joy.",
"2": "Lord Jesus, we are Your increase,
The church, the kingdom, now we see;
Lord, may we in Your kingdom live,
Fighting for Your interest.",
"chorus": "May Your recovery,
Forward march, spread far and wide.
May Your lampstands shine forth,
In each city so bright.
We fear not hardship nor evil,
For Lord You stand with us."}
