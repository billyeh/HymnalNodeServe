{"nonum": "These things says the Holy One,
The true One, the One who has the key of David,
The One who opens, no one will shut,
And shuts and no one opens:",
"nonum": "I know your works;
Behold, I have put before you an opened door
Which no one can shut,
Because you have
A little power,
Have kept My word,
Have not denied My name."}
