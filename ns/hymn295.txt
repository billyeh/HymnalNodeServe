{"chorus": "Lord, I give my heart to You
And all that's mine, enjoying You forever,
Lord, I give my heart to You
And all that's mine, enjoying You forever;
For the joy of loving You, my dear Lord,
In Your presence I'm in love with You,
As Your bride and wife,
Oh my Lord, I love You.
For the joy of loving You, my dear Lord,
In Your presence I'm in love with You,
As Your bride and wife,
Oh my Lord, I love You, Jesus."}
