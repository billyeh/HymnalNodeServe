{"1": "From the morning to the evening, His faithfulness I see;
His mercy reaching sinners, reaching even me;
And I know, now I know.
Brighter than the brightest sunlight, all doubts and fears must cease;
Sweeter than the sweetest delight, His living Word in me;
And I know, now I know.",
"chorus": "That God is there for me tomorrow,
As He is for me today;
That He'll take my cares and sorrow,
And He'll wipe them all away;
There's no crisis that He can't bear,
There's no storm He can't abate;
He's my God, He's my God.",
"2": "Day by day His grace grows dearer; His love has conquered me,
Never leaving, never ceasing, His Spirit constantly
Flooding me, rich and free;
Higher than the highest heaven, He lifts me up to see
New Jerusalem descending, His Bride, His love to be
Eternally, it shall be."}
