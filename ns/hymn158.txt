{"1": "Immersed in Thy love;
Fresher than morning dew;
Here I'm kept away from every earthly care.
Such tender feeling;
Caressed by my Beloved;
You're the loveliest, much fairer than the fair.",
"chorus": "Moments with You,
How affectionate!
Now I seize this opportunity to say
That I love You.
I will be with You
All my days, come what may.",
"2": "I cannot help it;
I'm so in love with You
For I've tasted Your divine heavenly wine.
I'm soaked with Thy love,
I pour my all on You.
What my future holds for me, my Lord are Thine.",
"3": "I'm so attracted
By Your constraining love,
And Your Name is sweet as ointment poured forth
I'm captivated by Your dear Person, Lord.
Draw me from this age to pursue only You..."}
