{"1": "Draw me, dear Lord, with Your beauty,
Capture my heart till earth fades away.
I need Your love to attract me
So I can love You more today.",
"2": "Empty me, Lord, how I need You!
Unclog my mind, emotion, and will.
All that I have, I abandon
So You can fill my heart today.",
"3": "Oh fill me now with Your life, Lord,
Flood my whole being with rivers divine.
I open wide; what enjoyment!
To live Your life, dear Lord, as mine."}
