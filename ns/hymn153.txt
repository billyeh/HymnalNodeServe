{"1": "Thy word is sweet unto my taste,
Yea, sweeter more than honey.
It says to watch and pray that you
May not enter into temptation.

But flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness,
faith, love, and peace.
Whatever you do,
do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
And pursue with those,
Those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."}
