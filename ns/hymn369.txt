["1 \"The new way brings forth the new man,\nThe new man walks on the new way.\"\nLord, give this new vision to us,\nTo all of the churches today.\nAnd as we begin this new year,\nMake every new day a new start,\nMake us the new persons in You:\nNew spirit, new mind, and new heart.", "2 We're walking in newness of life\nAnd singing a joyful new song;\nIn newness of spirit we serve,\nThis new one accord makes us strong.\nWe're drinking the new life divine,\nOh, how this new wine our heart cheers!\nThe new man will walk this new way\nUntil the new city appears.", "3 New man, new creation, new way,\nNew vision, new spirit, new light,\nNew year, and new month, and new day,\nNew mind, and new heart, and new sight,\nNew garment, new wineskin, new wine,\nNew blessings, and new covenant,\nNew mercies, and new life divine,\nAnd completed New Testament!"]
