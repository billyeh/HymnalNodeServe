{"1": "To realize and participate
In the deep and hidden things
God has ordained and prepared for us
Requires us not only to believe in Him
But also to love Him.
To fear God, to worship God,
And to believe in God,
That is, to receive God,
Are all inadequate;
To love Him is the indispensable requirement.
To love Him is the indispensable requirement."}
