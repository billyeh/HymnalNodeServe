["nonum Let the word of Christ dwell in you\nRichly, in all wisdom\nTeaching and admonishing one another\nIn psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs,\nSinging with grace in your hearts to the Lord\nAnd whatever you do, in word or in work\nDo all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,\nDo all in the name of our Lord."]
