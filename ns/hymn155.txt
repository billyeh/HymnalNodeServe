{"nonum": "Let the word of Christ dwell in you
Richly, in all wisdom
Teaching and admonishing one another
In psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs,
Singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord
And whatever you do, in word or in work
Do all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Do all in the name of our Lord."}
