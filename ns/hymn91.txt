{"1": "Make me a hungry seeker,
Your filling to receive.
Make mine a longing soul, Lord,
Your goodness satisfy me.
If I'm not hungry empty within,
Your blessing will pass me by.
Make me a hungry seeker, Lord,
I want Your rich supply.",
"2": "My eyes be set on You, Lord;
Each pleasure and each pain
Would make me look at You, Lord,
God's riches and grace to gain.
If I am full and think I'm rich,
Empty, You'll send me away;
Continually I'm hungry, Lord.
My heart on You will stay."}
