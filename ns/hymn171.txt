{"1": "I'm a beggar 'cause... I'm blind
So I take what I... can find
I'm groping for rea...lity
Only wishing I... could see
My parents, they can see
Why is this blindness in me?
All I know is I want to see reality.",
"2": "Lord, I am sitting by... the road
Begging outside of Je...richo
Now, Lord I hear that You... pass by
Lord, Son of David... I cry
Lord, Son of David, I cry
Please, Christ, don't pass me by
I believe that you can open my eyes.",
"3": "You gave me life but where's... my sight?
I am still blind and that's... my plight
Blind lead the blind and then... both fall
So right now on You... I call
Jesus have mercy on me
Open my eyes that I might see
All I know is my only hope is in You.",
"4": "Lord I am rebuked by... the crowd
For You I cry out more... the loud
All the world wants to di...stract me
So I forget that I... can't see
Jesus don't leave me behind
You are the one I want to find
All I know is I just really need You.",
"5": "Still I'm afraid that You'll... go on
But joyful ears hear You... respond
What would you like for me... to do
Oh Christ I just want to see You
Open my eyes to... see You
Let me find what my spirit can do
All I know is I just want to see You.",
"6": "In my spirit I... can see
Because that's where You... touch me
By your touch dear Lord... I'm healed
All my sin and death... must yield
Now Lord, I am healed
In my spirit You are so real
All I know is I want to keep touching You.",
"7": "Lord my sight is for... one thing
So that I to You... can cling
I think I'm in love... with You
No one else for me... will do
Lord Christ let me follow You please
You're so real and so special to me
All I know is Lord I never want to leave."}
