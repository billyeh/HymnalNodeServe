{"1": "I was in a world of misery
In this crooked and perverted generation;
But the Lord has call me there one day
And now I'm living in this new generation.",
"chorus": "Oh, what a wonderful story
Of me and my glorious Lord.
Together we make our history;
A mingling of God and of man-
Becoming the New Jerusalem,
Full of God's glory. Hallelujah!",
"2": "The Lord has regenerated me,
Calling me out of Satan's kingdom into Him;
Day by day, He is renewing me,
Sanctifying, transforming me to be like Him.",
"3": "Lord, help me to live a God-man life
At home, with the saints, or wherever I would be;
Taking Christ, living Christ as my life
Exercising forbearance without anxiety.",
"4": "I want to be an overcomer
O Lord, I consecrate myself to You right now.
O Lord, make me an overcomer-
Today and for the rest of my days here on earth."}
