["1 In a time before time,\nIn an age before the ages,\nThere was God, all alone, in eternity.\nYet He had a heart's desire.\nAnd an object He required;\nA desire in His heart\nFor a bride, a counterpart\nThat was deep inside the hidden heart of God.", "2 So the heavens He spread,\nEarth was made, its foundations laid.\nAt His word were the birds and the animals.\nThen He breathed the breath of life in\nTo a man created like Him.\nAs they walked along the way\nIn the coolness of the day\nThe intent was still within the heart of God.", "3 Man surveyed what God made\nGiving names, but he never came\nTo a mate, and he ached for a counterpart.\nHe could taste the 'ternal yearning\nThat so long in God was burning!\nEve was built from Adam's side\nAnd his heart was satisfied;\nTold the story of the hidden heart of God.", "4 But when Eve was deceived\nWhat was pure fell beyond a cure.\nDead to God through the dreaded serpent's subtlety.\nLeft creation in a quandary!\nGenerations lived in mystery!\nSeeking Job could not perceive\nBut persisted to believe\nThere was purpose in the hidden heart of God.", "5 In the time He designed\nHe was born of a virgin's womb\nTo reveal what was sealed from eternity.\nHe was born in human history\nTo reveal its greatest mystery.\nThat the answer for the earth\nWas that Christ so loved the church.\nHe would die to satisfy the heart of God.", "6 As the throne had foreknown\nMany men were deceived again\nThrough the lies they devised\nHe was crucified.\nAs the lonely grain was falling\nStill the joy before was calling;\nBlood and water from His side\nWould redeem and build His bride.\nShe would satisfy the riven heart of God.", "7 Though His death's final breath,\nFinally fell, He could not be held\nFor His life was divine and unbreakable.\nHe arises, powers hear it!\nHe will court her as the Spirit!\nAs the Spirit giving life\nHe will find and form His wife.\nShe will satisfy the living heart of God.", "8 When He breathed, she received\nHis divine personality,\nMoving in, washing sin, death and age away.\nSo that He might sanctify her\nBy the washing of the water!\nAdding beauty, adding health\nTo present her to Himself\nAnd to satisfy the holy heart of God.", "9 In a time beyond time,\nIn an age beyond the ages,\nGod and man will be one for eternity.\nHallelujah, what a story!\nShe was brought from gloom to glory!\nAnd the longing from the start\nFor a bride, a counterpart\nIs fulfilled inside the happy heart of God."]
