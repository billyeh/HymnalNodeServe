{"1": "Our Christ is so enjoyable,
His life is so applicable;
He lives in us to cause the flow
To reach the world, His life to show.
Don't just sit here and be idle;
Rise up! Your gift-don't belittle;
Let's eat and drink of this sweet Christ!",
"chorus": "Let's enjoy Christ to reach the goal,
Partake of Him to beat the foe,
All His vast riches we extol,
Yes, we are freed from every woe!
We may not know a lot of things,
But we are kept from Satan's stings
By eating Christ, and Christ alone!",
"2": "We all can do so many things,
But first of all to Christ we'll cling;
Enjoy Him first, blessings He'll bring,
His life-supply means everything!
Enjoy Him-grace He will bestow,
And we'll be led to join the flow;
Yes, we will do all things in Him."}
