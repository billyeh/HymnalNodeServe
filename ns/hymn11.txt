["1 Love covers all things and believes all things,\nLove hopes in all things and endures all things.\nLove never falls away and won't be rendered useless.\nBut other things will pass away.", "2 Life is the element of God, who's love;\nHence God as life is shown by love, through you.\nDon't neglect love, but pursue it first;\nLove makes a person spiritual.", "3 Love suffers long and love is kind, so kind,\nLove does not brag, is not puffed up,\nLove rejoices when God's truth is manifest,\nLove is the element of God.", "4 If I speak in tongues, but do not love, I am\nLike sounding brass giving lifeless sounds, not life.\nIf I know all mysteries but do not love my brother,\nI have no love and am nothing."]
