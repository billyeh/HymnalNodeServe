{"1": "Fallen, that's the way we all begin:
Imprisoned by the evil fate we're in.
How can we from this hard world of sin
be saved?",
"chorus": "Just by calling, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus."
Every moment, each day!
Calling on the name of Jesus-
We're finding is the way.
It's Jesus, Lord Jesus!",
"2": "Even though we love the Lord so much,
Somehow, it seems we get out of touch
With Jesus. How can we be freed from such
distress?",
"3": "Sometimes we know we aren't being real
Then times, we just live by how we feel.
Is there some way we could ever deal
with self?",
"4": "Christians, scattered throughout all the earth
Are wand'ring-Lord, where is Your Bride of worth?
How can all those of the second birth
be one?"}
