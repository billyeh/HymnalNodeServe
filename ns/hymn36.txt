{"1": "Sometimes it seems like
I have no room in my heart for You.
But then You touched me
And soften me to turn to You.",
"chorus": "Recover my heart,
Rekindle my love for You.
Fill me with love
Eternally, ever new.
Make me wholly Thine.",
"2": "Lord, I long to
Empty myself of all but You;
Give You my best love,
Preeminence in all I do.",
"3": "I want to love You
With all my heart and all my soul.
I want no other,
I give myself to be Yours alone."}
