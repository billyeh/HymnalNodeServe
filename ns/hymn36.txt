["1 Sometimes it seems like\nI have no room in my heart for You.\nBut then You touched me\nAnd soften me to turn to You.", "chorus Recover my heart,\nRekindle my love for You.\nFill me with love\nEternally, ever new.\nMake me wholly Thine.", "2 Lord, I long to\nEmpty myself of all but You;\nGive You my best love,\nPreeminence in all I do.", "3 I want to love You\nWith all my heart and all my soul.\nI want no other,\nI give myself to be Yours alone."]
