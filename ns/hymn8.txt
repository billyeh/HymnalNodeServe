["1 Blend us, Lord, blend us, Lord, 'til we are in one accord.\nHallelujah-the saints going on!\nBlend us, Lord, blend us, Lord, open hearts we can afford.\nHallelujah-the churches go on!\nAs the members of\nHis organic Body,\nWe need the others to go on.\nAs local churches,\nWe do also need\nOne another for our going on.", "2 Build us up, build us up, as with one another sup'.\nHallelujah-the riches of Christ!\nBuild us up, build us up, as with You we all rise up.\nHallelujah-the living Body!\nAs blended members\nOf His one Body,\nWe, the Lord do glorify!\nHis Light does shine!\nReviving Life does flow!\nAnd we do see that Satan is crushed!", "3 Bless us, Lord! bless us, Lord! All prevailing is Your blood!\nHallelujah, we're built up in love!\nConsummate! Consummate! All Your purpose consummate!\nHallelujah-\"The fullness thereof!\"\nThe gates of Hades\nNever will prevail\nAgainst the builded up church!\nWhen we are one,\nThe enemy is done!\nThe Lord Jesus is able to come!", "4 Intercede! Intercede! For Your people, meet Your need! \nHallelujah! Get Your Bride this way. \nHave Your way! Have Your way! Do a building work we pray-\nHallelujah-in our life each day! \nThrough the cross of Jesus, \nBy the Spirit filled, \nWe are blending, building up! \nWe all are one! \nWe are...Jerusalem! \nDear Lord Jesus, we ask You to come!"]
