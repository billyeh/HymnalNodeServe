{"1": "Greatly I rejoiced in the Lord,
Because your thinking for me
Now at length anew has blossomed,
Which you had indeed taken thought,
But lacked opportunity.",
"chorus": "Not by lack so that I speak,
But Christ my secret,
For I have learned in whatever circumstances
To be content.",
"2": "I know how to be abased,
And I know how to abound,
To be filled, to hunger or lack,
In all things and in everything
I've learned the secret.",
"3": "I am able to do all things
In Him who empowers me.
Nevertheless you did well
To have fellowship with me
In my affliction."}
