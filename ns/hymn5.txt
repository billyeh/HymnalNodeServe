That our God has put on humanity;
He's both God and man, as the Word reveals;
Hallelujah! until eternity.",

To produce a divine-human incorporation
Which consummates the New Jerusalem.",

With four types showing His humanity:
The seed of woman, the seed of Abraham,
The seed of David, the branch of Jesse.",

Visited Abraham, wrestled with Jacob,
Met Joshua as Captain of God's army,
Foretold Samson to be Israel's comfort.",

Despised and suffered for our redemption.
According to righteousness He will reign,
There will be enjoyment and protection.",

Above the territory of Satan.
On God's building did He take measurement,
In midst of Israel, for His possession.",

Is flesh, Son of Man-what an entity!
God's economy has a fulfilment,
All carried out in Christ's humanity."}
