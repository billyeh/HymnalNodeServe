{"1": "O glorious Christ revealed,
Myself I fully yield;
I long to run to You,
To kiss Your lips anew,
God's house is my desire,
Bethel, my dream realized;
A dwelling for the lonely,
A feast in Bethany.
Forgiveness, love and care,
Real kingdom life we share;
Peace and joy and righteousness,
The City filled with praise.
Campus, homes, and nations,
Whole earth propagation;
Glory and praise to His name,
To all the earth proclaim.",
"chorus": "Lord, I would offer myself,
Build Your organic Body;
Open homes,
Gain the young,
Shepherd men,
Perfect them,
Bring in the glorious church,
Hasten, Lord, Your return."}
