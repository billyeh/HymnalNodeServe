["1 O glorious Christ revealed,\nMyself I fully yield;\nI long to run to You,\nTo kiss Your lips anew,\nGod's house is my desire,\nBethel, my dream realized;\nA dwelling for the lonely,\nA feast in Bethany.\nForgiveness, love and care,\nReal kingdom life we share;\nPeace and joy and righteousness,\nThe City filled with praise.\nCampus, homes, and nations,\nWhole earth propagation;\nGlory and praise to His name,\nTo all the earth proclaim.", "chorus Lord, I would offer myself,\nBuild Your organic Body;\nOpen homes,\nGain the young,\nShepherd men,\nPerfect them,\nBring in the glorious church,\nHasten, Lord, Your return."]
