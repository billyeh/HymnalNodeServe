{"1": "I won't say goodbye
Or even think about all that I've left behind.
This world is worthless in my mind;
I've crossed the great divide;
No looking back, there's no way back to my old life.
To Christ I come, to Christ I go.",
"chorus": "I died to this world, but then He raised me, lifted to
The heavenly
And there I find His perfect peace; God and I live in
Harmony.
River of life, flowing freely.
Here I'll drink, and drink, and drink, and drink from
Now to Eternity.",
"2": "Raining day and night
While water rise, I'm safe inside my Christ the ark.
This world is buried 'neath the dark,
I've stepped into the light.
His word I see, I trace the rainbow through the sky.
To Christ I come, to Christ I go."}
