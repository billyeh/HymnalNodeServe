{"1": "The new covenant ministry-a ministry of God-
is the ministry of the Spirit who gives life (who gives life)
and of righteousness as the expression of God.",
"2": "The new covenant ministers are persons
Whose hearts have turned to the Lord,
Who are enjoying the Lord as the Spirit,
And who are being transformed
into the image of the Lord
by beholding and reflecting Him.",
"3": "The new covenant ministers are ambassadors of Christ
Carrying out the ministry of reconciliation
To bring us into God and to make us one with God.",
"4": "The new covenant ministers' living
Is a living of grace,
The experience of grace,
Which is the Divine Trinity
Transmitted into us for our enjoyment."}
