{"1": "He's the Spirit of reality,
Pneumatic Christ, the Firstborn Son in me,
The consummation of the Triune God,
Life-giving Spirit, all-inclusive Christ
 Intensified sevenfold.",
"2": "He's the Spirit of Reality.
He's the secret. He is one with me;
He's in my spirit. God dispensed in me
From my spirit, soul and then, body,
 Producing reality.",
"3": "Don't be fooled by outward circumstance.
Lord, do grant us visions and a trance:
The New Jerusalem, a mingling
A mutual dwelling place of God and man.
 Lord, You're reality!",
"4": "Seven Spirits and the seven eyes,
Organic salvation He intensifies,
Producing overcomers in this age,
To build His Body and to consummate
 The New Jerusalem."}
