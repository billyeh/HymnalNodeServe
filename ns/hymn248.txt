{"1": "God's complete salvation
Is based upon His righteousness and through our faith.
By the two divine transfers:
Out of Adam into Christ
And out of the flesh into the Spirit.
In the one spiritual union of the
Spirit of Life with our spirit
Forming a mingled spirit.
For us to reign in life by the abundance of grace
and of the gift of righteousness.
For us to reign in life by the abundance of grace
and of the gift of righteousness."}
