{"1": "May my day be full of Christ.
May my words be spoken in Him.
May my being find rest
Lying on His sweet breast,
May my day be full of Christ.",
"2": "May my mind be filled with His light,
May my spirit be shining so bright,
May His life bear much fruit,
May I be absolute,
To partake of the living Christ."}
