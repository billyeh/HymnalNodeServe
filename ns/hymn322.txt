{"1": "We have found a simple way for us to really touch the Lord:
All we do is pray four words, and O what grace He does afford!
From our spirit now we say them, and we spread the news abroad,
It's easy to touch the Lord!",
"chorus": "Oh Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!
Oh Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!
Oh Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!
It's easy to touch the Lord!"}
