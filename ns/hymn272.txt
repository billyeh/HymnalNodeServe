{"chorus": "The mighty God, even the Lord,
The mighty God, even the Lord,
Hath spoken, and called the earth
From the rising of the sun
Unto the going down thereof.",
"1": "Out of Zion,
The perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
Out of Zion,
The perfection of beauty, God hath shined.",
"2": "Our God shall come,
He shall come and shall not keep silence;
He shall call
To the heaven above and to the earth.",
"3": "Gather my saints
Gather my saints together unto me.
And the heavens
Shall declare His righteousness. Selah."}
