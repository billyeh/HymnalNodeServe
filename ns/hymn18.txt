{"1": "Jehovah is my Shepherd; I will lack nothing.
He makes me lie down in green pastures;
He leads me beside waters of rest.
He restores my soul; He guides me on the paths
Of righteousness for His name's sake.
Your rod and staff comfort me.
Though I walk through death's valley
I fear no evil, for You are with me.
You spread a feast before me,
You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over.
Goodness and lovingkindness
Will follow me always,
I will dwell in the house of Jehovah
For the length of my days."}
