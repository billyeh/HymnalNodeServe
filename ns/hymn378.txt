["1 What caused Mary to give her all?\nWhat moved Peter to answer Your call?\nMany lives were wasted for Your testimony;\nOh Lord, why do these people care so much for Thee?", "chorus See the vision of Christ and the church;\nCount the cost; reckon all things as loss;\nPay the price. The prize to gain Christ,\nBurn the bridges; leave the world behind;\nOn God's economy your heart be set\nTo live a life of no regrets.", "2 Others have considerations,\nWhen serving You, Lord, is the highest profession.\nNo longer good for the world with all its glory,\nWe're for Christ and the church, 'tis now our testimony.", "chorus See the vision of Christ and the church;\nCount the cost; reckon all things as loss;\nPay the price. The prize to gain Christ,\nBurn the bridges; leave the world behind;\nOn God's economy your heart be set\nTo live a life...", "chorus We've seen the vision of Christ and the church.\nReckoned the cost; all things are but loss.\nWill pay the price - give all of our lives;\nWe're burning bridges, left the world behind.\nOn God's economy our hearts are set\nWe're living a life...\nOn God's economy our hearts are set,\nWe'll live a life of no regrets.", "note (Stanza two has two choruses. Please view the video to see how they are sung.)"]
