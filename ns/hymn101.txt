{"nonum": "And we know that all things work together for good
To those who love God,
Those called according to His purpose.
For who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
In all things we more than conquer through Him who loved us.
Nothing shall separate us from the love of God,
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."}
