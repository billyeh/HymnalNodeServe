{"1": "Sun in the day, the moon at night, declare how great is Thy
Lovingkindness and Thy faithfulness (Psalm 92":2)
Give life and breath to man, Your race
Longing for them to seek Your face (Acts 17":25-27)
Loved me, You're not ashamed",
"I have called you by name" (Isaiah 43":1)
Healed me, the brutish and lame",
"I have held you by hand" (Psalm 73":23)
Your faithfulness, Your love untold
At last Lord You break my stronghold.",
"chorus": "We consecrate anew
Do train, conform us to You",
"May we be like the morning dew,",
"How I love You"
Young people satisfying You." (Psalm 110":3)",
"2": "Your charming self and cheering love drew me to run to You
I thought I could be absolute
But how I've failed, how I've stumbled
To run this race divine by self
Now I abhor myself",
"Look away unto Me" (Hebrew 12":2)
I just cannot prevail",
"It is by My Spirit" (Zechariah 4":6)
I am faithless, You're faithful still (2 Tim 2":13)
Your love is stronger than my will.",
"3": "Your gracious gifts, Your holy calls are irrevocable (Roman 11":29)
Though I am not but You are able
From strength to strength, grace upon grace (Psalm 84":7, John 1":16)

My life I give to You",
"I will never leave you" (Hebrew 13":5)
My dreams and future, too",
"Nor will I forsake you" (Hebrew 13":5)
Oh Lord I do! I do! I do!
I love You Lord I really do."}
