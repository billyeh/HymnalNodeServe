{"1": "The Lord has put me in the Body,
He has made a member out of me;
I'm leaving all the things on the tree of knowledge,
And learning how to eat the living tree.
Well now I'm taking in much more of Jesus!
He's put me on His farm here just to grow,
We're only here because we love our Jesus,
We stand as ONE so all the world will know.",
"2": "The Lord doesn't need more individuals,
He's got too many now, it's plain to see;
All He wants is One New Man forever,
And that doesn't leave any room for you and me.
The only way that we'll be one is Jesus!
The only way for Him to gather us,
Is by our EATING, DRINKING, BREATHING JESUS!
Until His riches overflow in us!",
"3": "The Lord has put me in the church life,
Christ and the church, His image to express;
He's chosen me according to His purpose,
And won't be satisfied with something less.
The only way that we'll be one is Jesus!
The only way for Him to gather us,
Is by our EATING, DRINKING, BREATHING JESUS!
Until His riches overflow in us!"}
