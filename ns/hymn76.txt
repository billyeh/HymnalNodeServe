["1 The Lord has put me in the Body,\nHe has made a member out of me;\nI'm leaving all the things on the tree of knowledge,\nAnd learning how to eat the living tree.\nWell now I'm taking in much more of Jesus!\nHe's put me on His farm here just to grow,\nWe're only here because we love our Jesus,\nWe stand as ONE so all the world will know.", "2 The Lord doesn't need more individuals,\nHe's got too many now, it's plain to see;\nAll He wants is One New Man forever,\nAnd that doesn't leave any room for you and me.\nThe only way that we'll be one is Jesus!\nThe only way for Him to gather us,\nIs by our EATING, DRINKING, BREATHING JESUS!\nUntil His riches overflow in us!", "3 The Lord has put me in the church life,\nChrist and the church, His image to express;\nHe's chosen me according to His purpose,\nAnd won't be satisfied with something less.\nThe only way that we'll be one is Jesus!\nThe only way for Him to gather us,\nIs by our EATING, DRINKING, BREATHING JESUS!\nUntil His riches overflow in us!"]
