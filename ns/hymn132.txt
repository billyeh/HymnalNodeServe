{"1": "The new covenant ministers
Are captives in a procession,
Defeated and subdued by Christ
For His victorious celebration.

Lord, make me Your captive.
Never let me win.
Defeat me all the time.
Lord, make home in me.",
"2": "The new covenant ministers
Are incense-bearers of Christ
Scattering His sweet fragrance
In every place-bringing death and life.

Lord, have the liberty
To fill me wholly.
Dear Lord, fill me daily!
Lord, make home in me.",
"3": "The new covenant ministers
Are Christ's own living letters
Inscribed with the Spirit of God,
To express the rich Christ to others.

Lord, write Yourself in me.
Inscribe in my heart
That I may write on others.
Lord, make home in me.",
"4": "The new covenant ministers
Are mirrors of the Christ of glory
Beholding and reflecting Him
So as to be transformed inwardly.

Lord, I turn my whole heart
To focus on You.
Shine in me, transform me.
Lord, make home in me.",
"5": "The new covenant ministers
Are earthen vessels that are worthless
Who live by the excellent p'wer
Of Christ as the treasure-priceless.

Lord, You are so precious!
I give You my whole being;
Break me, renew me, Lord!
Lord, make home in me.",
"6": "Lord, grant me the experiences
To produce such a ministry.
Through revelation and sufferings,
Lord, constitute Yourself in me.

By Your all-fitting life,
Lord, I learn to live.
By Your sufficient grace,
Lord, make home in me."}
