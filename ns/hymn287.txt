{"1": "There are times in my life
When my heart is embittered.
There are questions unanswered,
Yet, You're drawing me",
"chorus": "To enter
Into Your blessed sanctuary
And turning my eyes heavenward,
The questions of constant inquiry
Are changed to these words,",
"2": ""Whom do I have in heaven
But You, dear Jehovah.
My flesh and my heart
Constantly fail,",
"chorus": "But God's still
The strength of my heart and my portion;
To Him forever I'll draw near.
I've made Jehovah my sweet refuge.
So now throughout the years",
"3": "Turn my view to see You,
How I need to see Jesus!!
Though I don't understand
The ways that You take;",
"chorus": "Lord, make me
A babe and suckling always praising.
Enjoying Your worth day by day.
Let each experience constitute me
So Your life I'll display
In every way."}
