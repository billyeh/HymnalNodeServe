["chorus Lord, Thou has been our dwelling place in all generations.\nBefore the mountains were brought forth,\nOr ever Thou has formed the earth and the world,\nEven from eternity to eternity,\nThou art God.", "1 For a thousand years in Thy sight are but yesterday,\nWhen it is past as a watch in the night.\nSo teach us to number our days,\nThat we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.", "2 O satisfy us early with Thy mercy,\nThat we may rejoice and be glad all our days.\nMake us glad according to the days,\nAnd the years wherein we have seen evil.", "3 Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants,\nAnd Thy glory unto their children.\nAnd let the beauty of the Lord,\nThe beauty of the Lord, our God be upon us.\n(Repeat chorus as finale)"]
