With the saints along the way,
Singing, praising, and enjoying,
Fill our spirits 'til we say:",
"chorus": "Hallelujah for the blending!
It's the way to live today.
So we're standing and proclaiming,",
"In the church is where we'll stay."",

What a sight it is to see!
What a treasure He is building,
It's His Body corporately:",
"3": "We're so happy and so thankful
For this opportunity;
Thank You, Lord, You've been so faithful
To show all of this to me;"}
