{"1": "Each time in the morning, a while before dawn
To You, Lord, I whisper a praise or a song,
And feel Your life stirring so deep within me-
My cup runneth over with joy!",
"2": "And then at the moment my heart turns to Thee,
The eyes of my spirit Your presence can see;
While all is so fresh and the sunlight breaks through-
My cup runneth over with joy!",
"3": "And when at the noontime I'm hungry and worn
And feel that the cares of this world have me torn,
You come as my haven, my rest, and my food-
My cup runneth over with joy!",
"4": "And then in the evening when my thoughts are free,
Remembr'ing that You, Lord, still dwell within me,
This sweet fact releases a river in me-
My cup runneth over with joy!"}
