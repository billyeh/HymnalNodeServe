{"1": "In my spirit, I can see You as You are.
You're the Alpha, Omega, the Bright and Morning Star.
Here You'll stay, just as a flow within
To occupy my heart and spread Your life within,
In my spirit! You're all in all to me.",
"chorus": "In my spirit is the key,
No longer need I worry right or wrong;
In the church, reality-
Rooted, grounded in Your plan
 where I belong.",
"2": "In my spirit, I can see You in the church;
It's Your heart's desire, for it a people You will search.
Here I'll stay, within Your perfect will,
Built up into a home, Your glory here to fill.
In the church! I must no longer roam.",
"3": "In Your purpose, we just flow along in life.
It's so simple, no more unrest and strife.
In the churches, we just enjoy You, Lord.
Here You can build us up, for we're in one accord;
In the churches-we know You'll be back soon.",
"note": "(Repeat chorus and second verse)"}
