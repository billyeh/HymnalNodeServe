{"1": "God has called us into the fellowship of His Son,
That we may partake of Christ and enjoy Him
As our unique center and as our God-given portion.
God has called us into the fellowship of His Son.",
"2": "The enjoyment of the crucified Christ
as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit,
Solves all the problems in the church,
And issues in the growth in life,
And issues in the growth in life,
For the building up of the church.
For the building up of the church.",
"3": "The essence of the New Testament is the two spirits-
The divine Spirit and the human spirit-
Mingled together as one spirit.
The essence of the New Testament is the two spirits.",
"4": "Love is the most excellent way
And prophesying is the excelling gift
For the building up of the church,
For the building up of the church."}
