{"1": "Lord, You are the living spring,
The river of water of life;
Only You can quench my thirst;
Only You satisfy.
Lord, You are the living tree,
You are the Tree of Life;
Only You can fill my hunger;
Only You satisfy.",
"chorus": "Every moment in so many ways
He is the sure supply;
Now and forever and always,
Only You satisfy.",
"2": "Lord, You are the living vine,
In You we would abide;
Only You give life divine;
Only You satisfy.
So we must praise
And we must sing,
And we must testify;
Lord, You are the only One;
Only You satisfy."}
