{"1": "Bless me, Lord, with days and nights
Of talks alone with Thee,
With hours and minutes, moments too
That I would thus know Thee.",
"2": "Bless me with Thy presence sweet,
For I have naught but Thee;
Yea, nothing left but Thee Thyself,
Lord, give Thyself to me.",
"3": "Bless me with Thy shining light
And deal with every part.
That I would unreserved be
A channel of Thine heart.",
"4": "Bless Thee, Lord, forevermore;
Come in these days between
'Til I one day I am as Thou art
And Morning Star be seen."}
