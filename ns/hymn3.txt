["nonum God has a dream, this is what He's wanting.\nGod has a dream, and we are part of it.\nGod has a dream...that we may be one with Him.\nGod has a dream...realized in you and me!\nGod, you and me...a dwelling place to be.\nGod in man, and man in God: \"one entity.\nNow, it's my dream...my vision and life to be!\nGod has a dream...realised in you and me!"]
