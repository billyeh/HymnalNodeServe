{"nonum": "God has a dream, this is what He's wanting.
God has a dream, and we are part of it.
God has a dream...that we may be one with Him.
God has a dream...realized in you and me!
God, you and me...a dwelling place to be.
God in man, and man in God: "one entity.
Now, it's my dream...my vision and life to be!
God has a dream...realised in you and me!"}
