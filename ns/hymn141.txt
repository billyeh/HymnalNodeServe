{"1": "Since long before the world began,
In Your heart You longed for a Bride;
'Tis mutual dwelling, Your glorious plan;
With me e'er to abide.

Not knowing Your heart,
I sinned and thus should die;
Yet You shed Your blood to set me free.
You gave me Your life, to me drew nigh;
Wondrous love! We two one forever will be.

O glorious divine love! How can I fathom,
Higher than the sky, deeper than the sea;
It crushes death's pow'r and Satan's kingdom;
Nothing can compare with Your love to me
So fervid and so deep, so gentle and so true;
I'm in love, Lord, with You.

I give You my heart, my life and my soul,
Come suffering or joy whatever betide.
By Your boundless grace, I'll lay down my all
To build up Your church, Your glorious Bride;
Your heart to satisfy, mutual abode we'll be
In eternity."}
