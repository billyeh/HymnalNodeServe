["1 Since long before the world began,\nIn Your heart You longed for a Bride;\n'Tis mutual dwelling, Your glorious plan;\nWith me e'er to abide.\n\nNot knowing Your heart,\nI sinned and thus should die;\nYet You shed Your blood to set me free.\nYou gave me Your life, to me drew nigh;\nWondrous love! We two one forever will be.\n\nO glorious divine love! How can I fathom,\nHigher than the sky, deeper than the sea;\nIt crushes death's pow'r and Satan's kingdom;\nNothing can compare with Your love to me\nSo fervid and so deep, so gentle and so true;\nI'm in love, Lord, with You.\n\nI give You my heart, my life and my soul,\nCome suffering or joy whatever betide.\nBy Your boundless grace, I'll lay down my all\nTo build up Your church, Your glorious Bride;\nYour heart to satisfy, mutual abode we'll be\nIn eternity."]
