{"1": "I just keep calling, "O Lord!"
As I walk along;
I just keep calling, "O Lord"
And He gives a song.
Though the storm clouds darken the sky,
O'er the upward trail;
I just keep calling, "O Lord";
He will never fail.
He's a faithful friend,
Such a faithful friend;
I can count on Him
To the very end.
Though the storm clouds darken the sky,
O'er the upward trail;
I just keep calling, "O Lord"
He will never fail."}
