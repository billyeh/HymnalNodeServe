["1 Lord, when I'm bad I get so sad;\nIt seems the Lamb I never knew,\nBut blood was shed, depression fled\nSo now I hide in You.\n\nIt's in the Son I have begun,\nIt's in the Son I'll onward go\nIn Him I'll walk, in Him I'll talk,\nIn Him I'll surely grow.", "chorus Oh Jesus now grow in me;\nI want for You to be\nPleased to be in me what You want to be\nAnd when it gets too hard feel free\nTo grow some more in me.", "2 Lord, I'm not strange, I just can't change\nIt's not from lack of effort though\nThe more I try, the more I find\nI need for You to grow.\n\nWhere I have failed, Lord You've prevailed\nThe secret of success I know:\nThat all I need is life indeed,\nI pray for You to grow.", "3 With flags unfurled here comes the world\nIt's beauty does my heart embrace\nBut it grows pale whene'er that veil\nRemoved displays Your face.\n\nAs my heart turns, with love it burns\nYour face is all I want to see\nYour image Lord which I adore\nMy image soon will be."]
