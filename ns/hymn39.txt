{"1": "Lord, when I'm bad I get so sad;
It seems the Lamb I never knew,
But blood was shed, depression fled
So now I hide in You.

It's in the Son I have begun,
It's in the Son I'll onward go
In Him I'll walk, in Him I'll talk,
In Him I'll surely grow.",
"chorus": "Oh Jesus now grow in me;
I want for You to be
Pleased to be in me what You want to be
And when it gets too hard feel free
To grow some more in me.",
"2": "Lord, I'm not strange, I just can't change
It's not from lack of effort though
The more I try, the more I find
I need for You to grow.

Where I have failed, Lord You've prevailed
The secret of success I know:
That all I need is life indeed,
I pray for You to grow.",
"3": "With flags unfurled here comes the world
It's beauty does my heart embrace
But it grows pale whene'er that veil
Removed displays Your face.

As my heart turns, with love it burns
Your face is all I want to see
Your image Lord which I adore
My image soon will be."}
