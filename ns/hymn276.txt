{"1": "Rise up, my love, my beautiful one,
And come away, for behold, the winter is past,
The rain is over and gone.
Flow'rs appear on the earth,
The time of singing has come,
And the voice of the turtle dove
Is heard in our land.
My beloved is mine,
And I am His,
He who feeds His flocks among the lilies.
'Til the day breaks,
And the shadows flee away,
Come my beloved,
Come my beloved!
Rise up, my love, my beautiful one
And come away, for behold, the winter is past,
The rain is over and gone."}
