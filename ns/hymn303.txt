["1 Lord, I take You as my sin offering for what I am,\nBut Lord, I take You as my burnt offering for what I'm not.\nI'm not loving, submissive, patient, kind, or meek,\nI'm not single in view, Lord, nor is it God I seek.\nBut dearest Lord, You're all these things, all virtue's in You,\nSo Lord I lay my hands on You in all I do.", "2 Lord, in me is all self-love, envy, anxiety\nLord, in me is only pride and no humility.\nI'm not pure, Lord, or trusting, neither absolute\nFor Your purpose, I waver - I'm not resolute!\nBut dearest Lord, You're all these things, all virtue's in You,\nSo Lord I lay my hands on You in all I do.", "3 Such a laying on of hands is not for substitution;\nWhen we lay our hands on Christ, it brings in a union.\nBy our laying our hands on Christ, we are joined to Him.\nWe become one - no longer two - we become Him!\nIn such a union all our weaknesses, wounds, and scars\nAre taken on by Him and His virtues become ours.", "4 Such a union requires exercise through proper prayer\nWe open our failures, defects for our Lord to bear.\nAs we pray in this way, Christ - the One with no such sin\nAs the life-giving Spirit moves and works within\nTo live in us a life, a repetition of Christ our King,\nThe One who lived on earth the life of the burnt offering.", "5 Lord, You're balanced, fine and pure and loving through and through\nYou welcome the leprous ones, blind, lame all come to You.\nYou have eyes of a dove, Lord - blemish free are You.\nNo mixed motives, self-glory, what the Father says You do!\nYour humility's unsurpassed - obedient e'en unto death.\nTrusting in the Father's will, living by Him breath by breath!", "6 Thus, I open up to You each failure, blemish, and spot.\nI want You to know me, Lord, and know all that I'm not.\nYou're my Husband, my strong One, I am just Your wife.\nBear my burdens, my loved One, give me Your wonderful life!\nI take up this exchange, God Himself is what I've got.\nYou can bear all that I am, You can be all that I'm not!\nYou can bear all that I am, You can be all that I'm not!"]
