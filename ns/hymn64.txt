["1 There's a man who died to set us free.\nEverybody knows it's Jesus;\nHe came down from heaven just to live in me.\nEverybody knows it's Jesus!", "chorus Jesus, Jesus,\nEverybody call on Jesus!\nJust open your heart and open your mouth,\nYes, everybody call on Jesus!", "2 There's no other name on which to call,\nSo open up and call on Jesus;\nStop your doubting and start to call,\nJust open up and call on Jesus!", "3 Jesus fills the empty places with Himself,\nCome along and call, \"Lord Jesus!\"\nListen closely while we tell you 'bout His wealth,\nCome along and call, \"Lord Jesus!\"", "4 God's been waiting just to get inside of you,\nSo turn to Him and call, \"Lord Jesus!\"\nOpen up your heart and let Him into you\nBy calling on the name of Jesus!"]
