{"1": "O God of love, in Your everlasting love,
Yearning earnestly for Your elect,
As for Israel so long ago,
That they'd turn from their idols to gain
Your incarnate Christ as righteousness.",
"2": "Christ came as man, as Your righteousness to us,
That in Your divine economy
He Your people's everything might be
As our universality and our centrality
experienced.",
"3": "Wicked by birth, deceitful corrupt in heart,
Our one hope: "redemption from our fall,
Wickedness and sin, but that's not all-
The redemption of Christ and salvation by life
divine dispensed to us.",
"4": "Saved by Your life and Your life's capacity,
We're renewed that You could be our God
And that we Your people all could be
That we'd share the enjoyment of all of the riches of
the Trinity.",
"5": "Israel will be restored in the coming age;
With Your overcomers they'll enjoy
All Your riches which will consummate
In new earth and new heav'n for eternity in the New
Jerusalem."}
