{"chorus": "Reading the Bible-
I love the Word of God!
Reading the Bible-
I love the Word of God!",
"1": "Every verse reveals Yourself to me,
Every line conveys reality.
When I pray the words that You breathed out
You become so real to me.",
"2": "As I read, I pray, as I pray, I read,
Mingling both as one spontaneously.
You respond within with words so sweet,
I repeat these words to Thee.",
"3": "I'm a newborn babe-it's the milk I need,
Not the knowledge of the dead teaching.
When I eat Your word, it becomes to me
My heart's joy and rejoicing.",
"4": "Sweeter than honey, precious more than gold;
It will not be void, but as the rain and snow,
It will do Your will-bear the life divine,
Bearing fruit a hundred-fold.",
"5": "When my heart is like a rock so cold,
It's Your word so strong that hammers stone,
That the grain of life may come to me
And supply me inwardly.",
"6": "It's my food, my drink, and my life supply;
I love to eat it every day and night.
I just turn and open up to Him,
And the rivers flow right in."}
