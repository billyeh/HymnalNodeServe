["1 Do you know what you were made for;\nDo you ever wonder why?\nWhat's the purpose for your being;\nWhat's the reason you're alive?\nDo you know God wants to be your life?\nHe wants to be your life, He wants to be your life.\nYou were made with something deep within,\nA vessel to contain just Him.", "2 Deep within you is your spirit,\nEven deeper than your \"heart\";\nMany other things can fill you-\nOnly Jesus can fill this part.\nYou have been so empty all these years;\nIn spite of all you've tried, you're still not satisfied.\nDon't you feel a longing deep within\nTo open up and take Christ in?", "3 Doesn't matter how you see things,\nFor in God's eyes \"all have sinned\";\nJesus shed His blood to cleanse you\nFor the purpose of getting in.\nHe's done everything there is to do,\nAnd He's the Spirit now so He can get in you.\nMakes no difference what your past has been;\nThe living Christ will still come in.", "4 Just as you are in your body,\nPerfectly contained therein,\nGod wants you for His container,\nAll you need to do is let Him in.\nWould you open up from deep within\nTo let the Lord come in and fill you to the brim.\nWhy not open up from deep within\nAnd call upon the name of Him."]
