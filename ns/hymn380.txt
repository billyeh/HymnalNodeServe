{"nonum": "And to the messenger
Of the church in Philadelphia write:
These things says the Holy One,
The true One,
The One who has the key of David,
The One who opens and no one will shut,
And shuts and no one opens:",
"nonum": "I know your works;
Behold, I've put before you
An opened door
Which no one can shut,
Because you have a little power
And have kept My word
And have not denied My name."}
