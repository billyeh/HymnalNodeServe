["1 He washed away my sins,\nGave me a brand new heart;\nA heart to love Him, trust Him,\nSeek Him in His Word.", "chorus He tells me guard thy heart\nAbove all that thou guardest;\nFor out of it, flows the springs,\nThe springs of life.", "2 He walks with me each day;\nI open up to Him;\nHe is my life, my stay,\nAnd everything I need.", "3 And sometimes when I fail,\nI forget that He's there;\nHe's just waiting, watching,\nThen He draws me near."]
