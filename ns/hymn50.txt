{"1": "He washed away my sins,
Gave me a brand new heart;
A heart to love Him, trust Him,
Seek Him in His Word.",
"chorus": "He tells me guard thy heart
Above all that thou guardest;
For out of it, flows the springs,
The springs of life.",
"2": "He walks with me each day;
I open up to Him;
He is my life, my stay,
And everything I need.",
"3": "And sometimes when I fail,
I forget that He's there;
He's just waiting, watching,
Then He draws me near."}
