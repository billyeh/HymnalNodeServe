{"1": "Lord, do unveil
The more we strive, the more we fail
All the strife-they all come out to no avail.
Lord, they're just not for your need
By "self", we won't succeed.",
"2": "Lord, we confess
We are not able, Lord, unless
We have You; You're all in all-You're our success!
All we need, O Lord, is You
'Cause nothing else will do.",
"3": "O Lord, we pray
Increase Thyself in us each day
And the "self"-decrease it 'til it's done away.
Lord, we want the growth in life
We don't want all the strife.",
"4": "Lord, life's begun
Two spirits mingled into one
Day by day, walk in the spirit and we've won!
Then the "self" will be decreased
And Christ in us increased."}
