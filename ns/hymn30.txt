{"1": "Take time to receive Him-the blessing's outpoured,
And we may obtain it by reading His Word;
We bask in the splendour of His healing light,
And light becomes life, as in Him we delight.",
"2": "Take time to absorb Him, to gain the supply,
That we may be watered and nourished thereby;
The deeper the roots spread, the deeper the flow,
And richer and higher within us He'll grow.",
"3": "Take time to inhale Him-His Word we may breathe;
By breathing it, God's very life we receive-
He breathes Himself out so that we may breathe in
The life, the reality, fullness of Him.",
"4": "Take time to enjoy Him, our portion is He:
Our present, available reality;
Our practical, real, and enjoyable Lord
Is everything to us through His living Word.",
"5": "Take time to behold Him, gaze oft on His face,
Receiving His Person, and grace upon grace.
By His pleasant shining, infused we will be;
Our faces will glow with His light, radiantly."}
