{"nonum": "The goal of the gospel is that,
Loving the Lord Jesus
With the first love,
We would pour out upon Him,
Pour out upon Him
What is most precious to us,
Even our most costly and valuable
Spiritual treasure,",
"Wasting" ourselves upon Him.
Even our most costly and valuable
Spiritual treasure,",
"Wasting" ourselves upon Him."}
