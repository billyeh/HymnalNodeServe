{"1": "I want to tell You, Lord, how much You mean to me.
Through years of careful molding, Your plan at last I see.
Though pain I've had and suffering too,
Myself I yield at last, Lord, to You.",
"2": "I want to care for You, the way You've cared for me.
You've been my friend to comfort, received me when I've strayed.
And in return I offer You
My life so small compared, Lord, to You.",
"3": "I'd like for You to fill me with all that You are.
And empty out my heart from everything You're not.
You've blessed me Lord by finding me.
Possess me now eternally."}
