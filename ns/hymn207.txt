["1 Every new day's a new start.\nLord, again we're coming to You.\nLord, could You ever break through within us\nIf, Lord, we gave You a part?", "chorus O Lord, we can't do it on our own.\nO Lord Jesus, how we need You!\nWin us, woo us, to Thyself, Lord,\nThat we'd ever stay, Lord, with You.", "2 Lord, before time had begun,\nWe were marked and called out by You.\nWe had no choice, we were trapped by You, Lord;\nWe had no place we could run.", "3 Some of my friends are so free.\nWho could I blame, Lord, but Thee?\nI cannot do all the things that they do\nBecause You set me apart.", "4 Lord, I'm realizing that\nLoving You's a tender trap.\nSince You have kissed me, my heart has melted;\nAll my resistance has cracked."]
