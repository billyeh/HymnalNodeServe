["1 God wants someone to love Him,\nNot just someone to serve Him;\nHe wants someone to love Him\nAs His bride.\nGod wants someone to match Him,\nNot just to imitate Him;\nHe wants a counterpart,\nOne from His side.", "chorus For this He came down to us,\nHe came to court, to woo us,\nAway from everything, and unto Him.\nNow we're espoused unto Him,\nPledged and betrothed unto Him;\nYes, we are bound unto Him by His love.", "2 God wants someone to love Him,\nNot just someone to fear Him;\nHe wants a sweetheart who will\nBe His bride.\nGod wants someone to know Him,\nNot just to know about Him,\nHe wants someone who'll look Him\nIn the eye."]
