{"1": "Fear not, He knows;
My soul why fret and tremble?
Fear not, He knows;
Your life is in His hands.
Fear not, He knows;
And you know He is able
To care for You,
So trust the best is planned!",
"chorus": "Oh Lord, You know;
'Tis a thought so joyous!
Though I don't know,
What need have I to fear?
You know, You know;
Thank and praise You, Jesus!
Through all unknowns,
You make Yourself so dear!",
"2": "Just trust, He knows
Life's still unwritten letter.
Just trust, He knows
Plans time would now disguise.
Just trust, He knows,
He sees which turn is better;
At the right time
He'll open up your eyes!",
"3": "Just rest, He knows;
With Him blindness is pleasant!
Just rest, He knows;
Sightless, you see Him best!
Just rest, He knows;
My soul, don't waste the present
On those "what-if's".
Just turn to Him and rest!",
"4": "Just seek, He knows;
Seek first His heart's great yearning.
Just seek, He knows;
Serve Him, in Him abide.
Just seek, He knows;
Have peace and rest while turning.
Put His cares first;
All else He will provide."}
