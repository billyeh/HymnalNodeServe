{"chorus": "Did you know that I'm a God-man?
A three-part man mingled with the Triune God,
And I have a spirit
Where the enemy has no way, no hope, no ground...
I am a God-man!
[I am a God-man] (spoken)",
"1": "The Lord lives inside of Me,
And He's using my spirit as a beachhead
To spread Himself into every part
Of my mind, emotion, and will.
He sowed Himself as the seed
Into my innermost part-
And the kingdom is here,
Today, now, inside of me
And my heart is now His home!",
"2": "Every time I say "Amen" to His Spirit
And walk by my spirit,
The kingdom seed grows and develops
Deep inside of me.
On the outside, it may seem that there's
No change in me-
But I'm not the same,
'Cause as the seed grows in me,
Inside I'm becoming God!"}
