{"1": "He who sows unto his own flesh
Reaps corruption of the flesh, (trouble)
He who sows unto the Spirit
Will reap eternal life.",
"chorus": "God's not mocked,
Do not be deceived,
For whatever you sow, you will reap,
You will reap what you sow;
Sow the life seed.",
"2": "Every choice is planting seeds,
So be careful what you sow. (careful)
Just as an apple seed,
It will grow an apple tree."}
