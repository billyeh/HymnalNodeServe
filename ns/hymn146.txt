["1 He who sows unto his own flesh\nReaps corruption of the flesh, (trouble)\nHe who sows unto the Spirit\nWill reap eternal life.", "chorus God's not mocked,\nDo not be deceived,\nFor whatever you sow, you will reap,\nYou will reap what you sow;\nSow the life seed.", "2 Every choice is planting seeds,\nSo be careful what you sow. (careful)\nJust as an apple seed,\nIt will grow an apple tree."]
