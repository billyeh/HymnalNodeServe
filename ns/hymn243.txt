["1 The Church of God-we are the church,\nSo important to God's great plan;\nOrganic, full of God's rich life,\nWe're born into the living church.\nEssence, nature of God, not man,\nThe foundation is Christ, Himself.\nThe glorious church the glorious church\nIs God expressed. Is God expressed.", "2 We need to see the House of God,\nThe Assembly of called out ones,\nGod's masterpiece and His Kingdom,\nHis counterpart; her purpose is\nSatisfaction and rest in love.\nIt's God's desire that Christ may have\nA bride, a wife, a bride, a wife\nEternally. Eternally.", "3 The One New Man has Christ our Lord\nAs a Person, expressing God,\nSubdues Satan for God's purpose.\nBody of Christ with Christ our Head,\nSupplying us with His riches;\nMany members, all functioning,\nYet all are one, yet all are one\nWith Christ as life. With Christ as life.", "4 Hallelujah! The two aspects:\nUniversal and the local church.\nThe local ground preserves oneness;\nGenuine oneness will be obtained.\nOne fellowship and one teaching\nThroughout the earth, universal\nBody expressed, body expressed\nLocally. Locally.", "5 Learn the lesson from church hist'ry\nOf the failures we must avoid;\nDegradation we fight against,\nRecov'ring from divisive ground\nTo the oneness of the Body;\nReturning to what God's revealed.\nLord build in us, Lord build in us\nThe Kingdom life. The Kingdom life.", "6 We believers have been renewed,\nMust grow in life and be matured,\nPerfected as overcomers\nSo that we as the builded church,\nThe corporate Bride, will consummate\nAll in the New Jerusalem-\nFulfilling God's, fulfilling God's\nEternal plan! Eternal plan!"]
