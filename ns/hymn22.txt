{"1": "Lord Jesus Christ, I do love You
Because You first loved me.
You shed Your blood, were crucified,
While hanging on a tree.",
"2": "In resurrection and through death,
You mingled God with man-
Produced Your Body, consummating
The New Jerusalem.",
"3": "For You Lord, open my heart wide.
With others build me up.
In You we would together blend,
Enjoy Salvation's cup."}
