["1 Lord Jesus Christ, I do love You\nBecause You first loved me.\nYou shed Your blood, were crucified,\nWhile hanging on a tree.", "2 In resurrection and through death,\nYou mingled God with man-\nProduced Your Body, consummating\nThe New Jerusalem.", "3 For You Lord, open my heart wide.\nWith others build me up.\nIn You we would together blend,\nEnjoy Salvation's cup."]
