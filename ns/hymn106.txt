{"1": "Until He comes again,
I'll watch and wait and call on Him
I'll pray that by His life and power,
I'll overcome in every hour.",
"2": "Until He comes again,
His blood will cleanse me of my sin
His word will sanctify within,
And make me wholly unto Him.",
"chorus": "(Bro.) He died to be life to me-
 From death I'm free.
(Sis.) He rose and as Spirit He
 Now lives in me.
(Bro.) In splendor and in glory
 Like Him I'll be.",
"3": "Until He comes again,
My soul-life I'll give up for Him.
No worldly pleasure can compare
To what my Savior has to share.",
"4": "And when He comes again,
All saints built up and one in Him.
His Body, Bride, and Counterpart,
Eternal pleasure of His heart.",
"chorus": "(Sis.) Lord, gain Your kingdom in me,
 I long to be...
(Bro.) One with my Savior and King,
 Eternally.
(Sis.) Oh, what a joy it will be
 Your face to see."}
