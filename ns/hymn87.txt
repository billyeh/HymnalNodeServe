["1 Let's mingle and blend,\nOur hearts knit again,\nIn the family of God.\nLet's mingle and blend,\nOur hearts knit again,\nWith our family of God.", "chorus Isn't it pure and fine?\nIsn't it right and holy?\nIsn't it noble, true?\nIsn't it sweet and lovely?", "2 Open up your heart, \nOpen up your home,\nOpen up your mouth,\nOpen up your song,\nOpen up your life,\nOpen up your time,\nOpen up your poem,\nOpen up your rhyme.", "3 How we love one another!\nWe are sisters! We are brothers!\nHow our hearts fill with love\nWhen we think on things above!", "4 Let's mingle and blend...\nOur hearts knit again...\nIn the spirit of love...\nIn the fam'ly of God."]
