{"1": "I'm a sinner without one plea,
But the Lamb of God in me;
I was lost and without hope
But my Savior came and sought me out.
'Tis my story and my song;
To the world I say so long;
I now walk and live in light
With the New Jerusalem in sight.",
"chorus": "Till the end of days,
He will be with me
And lead me to that place;
I give my all:
My life, my ways, my thoughts,
And everything to Him, my love.",
"2": "Sometimes I think that I might leave
And wallow in misery,
But then graciously He comes
And applies His gentle, soothing touch.
'Tis my story and my fight;
To the self I say goodbye;
I now walk and live in light
With the coming kingdom full in sight."}
