["1 I'm a sinner without one plea,\nBut the Lamb of God in me;\nI was lost and without hope\nBut my Savior came and sought me out.\n'Tis my story and my song;\nTo the world I say so long;\nI now walk and live in light\nWith the New Jerusalem in sight.", "chorus Till the end of days,\nHe will be with me\nAnd lead me to that place;\nI give my all:\nMy life, my ways, my thoughts,\nAnd everything to Him, my love.", "2 Sometimes I think that I might leave\nAnd wallow in misery,\nBut then graciously He comes\nAnd applies His gentle, soothing touch.\n'Tis my story and my fight;\nTo the self I say goodbye;\nI now walk and live in light\nWith the coming kingdom full in sight."]
