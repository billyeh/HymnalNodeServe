{"1": "There is now then no condemnation to those
Who are in Christ Jesus.
For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me
In Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.",
"chorus": "For the mind set on the flesh is death,
But the mind set on the spirit is life.
So I will walk in the Spirit today,
Being filled with life and peace!",
"2": "For that which the law could not do, being weak,
In the flesh, God sending His Son,
In the likeness of flesh, and concerning sin,
He condemned sin in the flesh.",
"3": "That the righteous requirement of the law
Might be fulfilled in us,
Who do not walk according to the flesh of sin
But who walk according to the spirit.",
"4": "For those who are according to the flesh,
They all mind the things of the flesh;
But those who are according to the spirit,
Mind the things of the Spirit."}
