{"1": "Come, all ye saints, and sing with me.
His love and joy have set me free.
The greatest Savior ever, He!
Come praise and sing in Jubilee!",
"chorus": "He changed my life with one simple call.
He gained my heart to love Him o'er all.
And now I will praise Him, and tell the whole world.
I love my Jesus forevermore!",
"2": "Our Lord has been anointed for
Announcing good news to the poor,
Release to captives-ye much more-
The blind, their sight He has restored.",
"3": "You, Lord, have sent away, released,
Those once oppressed, whose bondage ceased.
You have proclaimed today to be
God's promised year of Jubilee.",
"4": "Lord, You have now fulfilled God's Word;
Your proclamation we have heard.
We join with You, our hearts You've stirred;
God's kingdom's here, the age has turned."}
