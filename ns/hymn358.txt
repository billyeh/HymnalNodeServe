["chorus Lord, You revealed Yourself to me,\nYou showed me Your purpose,\nTo have the church as Your body\nSo You can mingle all that You are.", "1 Though I am blinded by self and flesh\nBut You, dear Lord, have chosen me\nAs a vessel to contain You\nAnd express You 'til You come back.", "2 Forgive me, Lord I'm open to You.\nFill me more and more each day.\nBuild me with the saints in love\nAnd keep us running toward the prize.", "3 Lord keep me growing and functioning.\nDon't ever let me out of Your sight.\nGrant me a spirit of boldness.\nOpen my mouth, Lord, to prophesy."]
