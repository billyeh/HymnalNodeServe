{"1": "Jesus won't You come, won't You come, won't You come,
We say to our Bridegroom come.
Jesus won't You come, won't You come, won't You come,
We say to our Bridegroom come.",
"2": "Blend us all us one, all as one
That we will be a Bride that matches You perfectly.
Make us all to be, all to be, all to be
The expression of Your glory.",
"chorus": "Oh, our love!
We know You are longing for Your Bride!
Lord, we long that Your heart's desire would be satisfied."}
