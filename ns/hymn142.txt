{"1": "In nothing be anxious,
But in everything,
By prayer and petition
With thanksgiving,
Let your requests, let your requests
Be made known to God;

In nothing be anxious,
But in everything,
By prayer and petition
With thanksgiving,
Let your requests, let your requests
Be made known to God;

And the peace of God,
Which surpasses
Every man's understanding,
Will guard your hearts
Will guard your thoughts
In Christ Jesus."}
