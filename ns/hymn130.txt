{"1": "Lord, how I thank You that
You died on the cross for me.
Your mercy, my Savior, reached me.
And Lord, You paid the highest price,
My life bought with Your shed blood,
My life now belongs, Lord, to You.

And Lord, how can I turn away from Your love,
The eternal love which You have for me?
I give You my heart;
Lord, spread in every part,
Till my whole heart belongs to You.",
"2": "Lord gain my heart so that
It is single and pure for You.
No other love, Lord would I know.
Lord I am so in love with You.
For You are so lovely,
My everything, my all in all.

And Lord, I really want to know
This Person inside of me.
Lord, keep my heart open to You.
Keep flowing Your life,
Into me that I would grow,
And be saturated with You."}
