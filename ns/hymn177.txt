["1 The Triune God and the Person\nAnd the work of Christ,\nThe Triune God is a mystery,\nThe mystery of life.\nThe Father, Son, and Spirit-\nThree-One now to be,\nNot for comprehending,\nBut to flow into me.", "2 The Triune God is forever,\nForever to be\nThe life supply in my spirit;\nHe's dwelling in me!\nThe Father in the Son came\nDisplayed for all to see;\nThe Son as Spirit flows now\nTo flow God into me.", "3 I'm calling His name \"Lord Jesus\";\nHe's coming in my heart.\nHe's spreading out from my spirit\nTo all my inward parts.\nThe more I contact daily,\nThe more my heart Christ's home,\nAnd with the saints I'm built up\nInto the church, Christ's home!\n(Repeat verse 3)"]
