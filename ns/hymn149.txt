["1 Christ has come to be life, the processed divine Trinity.\nGod the Father's the source, a fountain emerging to be.\nGod the Son as a gushing up spring,\nAnd the Spirit's a river for life imparting\nOh how can this miracle be? The Triune God flowing in me!\nOh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!\nI've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!", "chorus As this life flows through me, I'm supplied abundantly.\nHis life nullifies sin! Power springs now from within!\nTo be free, overcoming spontaneously.", "2 Yet this life though it frees, is not meant for mere victory.\nGod is full of intent and never could flow aimlessly.\nSo this life has a totality, a consummate issue encompassing me.\nLife moves and life grows, life shapes as it flows\nNow I share in this life's destiny.\nOh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!\nI've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!", "chorus We'll abide mutually, God and man revealed to be\nLamb, Wife, Spirit, and Bride.\nCome! Drink! And riverside, \nGrows the tree, our enjoyment for eternity!", "3 So I've no cause to frown as one who's received this zoe.\nI know life runs its course and triumphs inevitably.\nI'm required just to stay in the flow, \nIf I do the drinking then God gives the growth.\nSo there's joy in my heart, and a spring in my step, \nAnd a smile on my face as I sing,\nOh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!\nI've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!"]
