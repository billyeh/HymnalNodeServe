{"1": "O there's One in me who
Is the most lovely One
In the whole universe-
I just love Him.",
"2": "He has made me fall in love
With Him more and more each day:
And for now that I'm in love-
I'll always stay.",
"chorus": "For my Jesus has captured my heart.
He has wrecked me with all He can impart.
He drew me to Himself,
Now I love nothing else.
His beauty, love and charm won my heart.",
"3": "As the days go on and on
There's a hold that is so strong.
A tide floods all my being-
For I'm in love.",
"4": "There's a face I long to see
Whose arms will embrace me.
As I rest in this sweet place
I love Him more and more."}
