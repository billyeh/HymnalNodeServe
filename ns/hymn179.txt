{"1": "Recall how David swore,",
"I'll not come into my house,
Nor go up to my bed,
Give slumber to mine eyelids,
Until I find a place for Thee,
A place, O Lord, for Thee."
Our mighty God desires a home
Where all His own may come.",
"2": "How blinded we have been:",
"We'll build Your habitation"
When we are short of Christ-
We need Your saturation!
O Lord, You care for our house!
Oh, what a blessed word!
As You're to God, You'd be to us-
A mutual abode.",
"3": "There's nothing that we are
Or have or do well-pleasing;
We need Thee, glorious Christ,
Inwrought into our being.
O Lord, our heart's still vacant now!
Come in and settle down.
Come saturate and permeate
And fill us with Yourself.",
"4": "Our spirit You have filled
At our regeneration,
But mind, emotion, will
Await Your saturation.
How much of You is built in us
To make our heart Your home?
O Triune God, we welcome You.
Come build, oh, build in us.",
"5": "Into our innermost
Intrinsic constitution,
Come, Lord, Yourself dispense
By constant, fresh infusion;
Transform us, Lord, and work Yourself,
As God's embodiment,
Into our heart, and life each part,
With Your reality.",
"6": "To build Your house today,
Self-effort You're refusing-
All stubble, wood, and hay;
Gold, silver, gems, You're using.
The consummated Triune God
Transmitted into us
Now builds Himself into a home-
His dwelling, glorious.
