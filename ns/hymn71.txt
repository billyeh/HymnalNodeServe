{"1": "I have lived my life by myself,
Never letting You get too close to me,
Kept my heart preoccupied with empty things;
My eyes have failed to see.

But You had called me,
How could I explain,
All the things I thought were real were vain.",
"2": "Deceived by sin since cunning words
He made me hold in things that fade away
He weighs my ears, and keeps me bound;
Never letting me out of his domain.

And then You freed me,
Transferred from the place,
Brought into the kingdom of Your grace.",
"3": "Bring me to be with others, Lord,
That we express Your Person corporately.
A living stone for building now,
Make us to be Your Body, one with Thee.

Lord, keep growing,
Your building would complete, 
One in Christ for all the world to see."}
