["1 Christ is God incarnated,\nBorn according to God's plan\nTo bring divinity, into humanity,\nBy mingling with man.\n\nChrist is God incarnated,\nHe became the Son of Man;\nA man of flesh yet without sin,\nAccomplishing redemption,\nHe was a perfect man.", "chorus And He shall be named Jesus,\nAnd called Emmanuel,\nHallelujah! God with us,\nIn man He came to dwell.", "2 Christ is God incarnated,\nHow wonderful! How marvellous!\nIncarnated so that He could\nLive inside of you and me,\nHe's mingling now with us.\n\nChrist is God incarnated,\nHe became the first God-man.\nOh! How glorious!\nNow He lives inside of us,\nFulfilling God's great plan."]
