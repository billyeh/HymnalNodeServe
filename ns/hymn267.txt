{"1": "Now on the last day, (Now on the last day,)
The great day, (The great day,)
The day of the feast, (The day of the feast,)
The day of the feast, (The day of the feast,)
Jesus stood (Jesus stood)
And cried out (And cried out)
If anyone thirsts
let him come to Me...
If anyone thirsts, (If anyone thirsts,)
Let him come to Me (Let him come to Me)
And drink, and drink, and drink."}
