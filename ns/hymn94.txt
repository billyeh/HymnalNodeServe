{"1": "To be set free from the bond of sin,
To have the joy and peace within,
To live a life full of meaning,
Believe into Jesus.
Man's way to please God is religion;
God's way is a living Person;
Christ is God's way of salvation;
Believe and you'll be saved.",
"chorus": "It pleases God to rescue us
Out of this present evil age,
And to reveal His Son in us
In life's every stage.",
"2": "We have received Christ as the Spirit
Through faith and not by our merit;
Having begun by the Spirit,
We learn to live by faith.
We now are sons of the living God,
Enjoying the Blessing of our Lord,
Grace to our spirit He will afford,
We're freed from self-effort.",
"3": "Oh what a joy! Christ now lives in us;
No longer I-how glorious!
He is daily growing in us
'Til He is formed in us.
Living and walking by the Spirit,
Enjoying the fruit of the Spirit;
To Him our lives we do commit,
Not to any vain act."}
