{"chorus": "Lord, there's nothing in this world like You;
You fill me up completely.
And I would never give You up for anything
Because nothing else could satisfy me so.",
"1": "People think that they can find
Satisfaction, peace of mind.
Everything leads to another,
But I've found the best.",
"2": "No more trying something else,
Or thinking that there's something more;
No more hoping "someday,"
'Cause today I have the best.",
"3": "Looking not at failures past,
Hoping not in future dreams;
Not wishing I were different,
Knowing everything's the best."}
