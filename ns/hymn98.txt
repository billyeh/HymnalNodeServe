{"chorus": "I'm walking down the road
That leads to glory.
I'm pressing toward the mark
By enjoying God!
I don't know so much,
Just to love Him.
I'm walking down the road,
Glory, here I come.",
"1": "With the brothers and the sisters,
We enjoy Him day by day.
It's so simple and easy,
Our worries flee away.
Now we're growing together,
As one big family,
Abiding in the joy of the Lord.",
"2": "We enjoy You, Lord Jesus,
In our experience.
We're getting to know You-
It's making us leap and dance.
Just eating and drinking,
It's what we do the best,
Delighting in the love of the Lord.",
"3": "We're walking, not running,
Cause we're in the pasture land.
Our Shepherd is nearby,
We're trusting in His hand.
He's everything to us,
He's all we ever need,
Resting in the peace of the Lord."}
