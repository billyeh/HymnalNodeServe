{"1": "With the kisses of Your mouth,
Have You kissed me, Lord.
From Your kisses flows a fountain,
From a depth unknown.
Gently tempered by Your touching
Of my deepest chords,
My heart's renewed with gladness,
And my love o'erflows.",
"2": "Let me kiss You, drink You deeper,
Fully satisfy
All the longings deep within me,
For Your presence nigh,
And a deeper, sweeter union,
Of Your life with mine
That our natures fully mingled,
Would our hearts entwine.",
"3": "Ever increase, Lord, within me,
My desire for You.
Let Your kisses ever kiss me,
And that I'd kiss You.
Dear Lord Jesus, may I ever be,
So betrothed to You.
May I love You, always love You,
And respond to You.
May I love You, always love You,
And respond to You."}
