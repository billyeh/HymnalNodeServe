{"1": "I have fought the good fight;
I have finished the course;
I have fought the good fight;
I have kept the faith.",
"2": "Henceforth there is laid up for me
The crown of righteousness,
Which the Lord, the Righteous Judge,
Will recompense me in that day,
And not only me
But also all those who have loved His appearing."}
