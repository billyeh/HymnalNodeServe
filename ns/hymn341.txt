["1 I have fought the good fight;\nI have finished the course;\nI have fought the good fight;\nI have kept the faith.", "2 Henceforth there is laid up for me\nThe crown of righteousness,\nWhich the Lord, the Righteous Judge,\nWill recompense me in that day,\nAnd not only me\nBut also all those who have loved His appearing."]
