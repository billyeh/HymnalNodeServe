{"1": "Lord Jesus, You're lovely.
You're more to be desired,
Than any earthly pleasure.
You're fine, beyond compare.
Lord Jesus, Your beauty
Does far exceed all others.
You're comely and You're tender.
You're radiant and You're fair.",
"2": "When I behold You Jesus,
You draw my heart completely.
I cannot turn away Lord,
I rest in Your embrace;
And time is gone there's only
Your holy, matchless presence
Abiding in You, gazing
Upon Your glorious face.",
"3": "I give my life to You Lord,
For You alone are worthy.
There's nothing and there's no one
That I desire but You.
May all my days be Yours, Lord,
My heart be given to love You,
To treasure and to serve You
By Your sufficient grace."}
