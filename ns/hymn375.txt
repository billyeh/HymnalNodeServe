{"nonum": "For we do not have a High Priest who cannot
Be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses,
But One who has been tempted in all respects like us,
Yet without sin, yet without sin.",
"nonum": "Let us therefore come forward
With boldness to the throne of grace
That we may receive mercy and find grace
For timely help."}
