{"chorus": "Jesus Christ You are the Man-Savior
Expressing God;
Beautifully, sweetly, and pleasantly.",
"1": "Jesus Christ, the genuine, complete,
Moral, perfect Man revealing God;
In His saving grace to fallen man,
In the Jubilee of grace.",
"chorus": "Jesus Christ You are the God-Man-
The reality,
The reality of the Jubilee.",
"2": "Tell me all about the Shepherd Who
Left the ninety-nine to find the lost sheep;
How You came to earth to search for me,
And came rejoicing when You found me.
(Repeat Chorus 1)",
"3": "Tell me all about the Woman Who
Lit the lamp and swept
Throughout the whole house,
Seeking everywhere to find one coin!
I'm so glad the Spirit found me!
(Repeat Chorus 2)",
"4": "Tell me all about the Father who
Waited every day to greet His lost son;
Kissed his neck
And gave him the finest robe,
And brought him back into the household.
(Repeat Chorus 1)"}
