{"1": "How glorious is Thy church, Oh Lord-
No trace of sin in her.
What myst'ry this: "God died as man,
For, oh, He loves her so!",
"chorus": "Glorious, Glorious church,
She is Thy dear Bride;
She was built from Thine own side;
She is the same as Thee.",
"2": "How precious is Thy Body, Lord;
How costly in Thy sight.
I'd ne'er bring anything of self,
For she is out from Thee.",
"3": "How faithful is Thyself, dear Lord-
Eternally the same.
Though man may fail to reach Thy will,
Thou shalt obtain Thy Bride.",
"4": "How subtle is my self, Oh Lord;
Yet I wilt be transformed.
Through Spirit's work-become a stone
To build up Thine own Bride.",
"5": "How precious is Thy Body, Lord;
How costly in my sight.
I would decrease, and Thee increase
At any cost for her."}
