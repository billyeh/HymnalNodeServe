["1 Lord Jesus, I love You.\nYou're my all-\nYou're my all in all.\nYou gave me life indeed;\nYou're all I need,\nYou're all I need.\nReal peace and joy I never knew,\nUntil in spirit I touched You, so-", "chorus Lord, I just open up to You;\nI let You do what You want to do.\nLord, I just give myself to You,\n'Cause I love You-Lord, I do.", "2 You save me all day long;\nThough I'm weak,\nYou're so strong.\nThe flow of life and peace\nWithin me shows the way,\nHour by hour, day by day;\nAnd if through weakness I should fall,\nYou always save me when I call, so-\n(Repeat Chorus)", "3 O Lord, one touch with Thee\nBrought life into me.\nAnd now I can't live without You.\nYou're my only delight-\nYou've made everything right\nWith a love that constrains me\nTill I say that-\n(Repeat Chorus)\nYou're my lover-You're my all."]
