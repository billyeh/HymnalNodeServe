{"1": "Lord Jesus, I love You.
You're my all-
You're my all in all.
You gave me life indeed;
You're all I need,
You're all I need.
Real peace and joy I never knew,
Until in spirit I touched You, so-",
"chorus": "Lord, I just open up to You;
I let You do what You want to do.
Lord, I just give myself to You,
'Cause I love You-Lord, I do.",
"2": "You save me all day long;
Though I'm weak,
You're so strong.
The flow of life and peace
Within me shows the way,
Hour by hour, day by day;
And if through weakness I should fall,
You always save me when I call, so-
(Repeat Chorus)",
"3": "O Lord, one touch with Thee
Brought life into me.
And now I can't live without You.
You're my only delight-
You've made everything right
With a love that constrains me
Till I say that-
(Repeat Chorus)
You're my lover-You're my all."}
