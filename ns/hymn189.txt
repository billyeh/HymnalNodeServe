{"1": "The issue of the third fall of man,
The withdrawing of the Holy Spirit;
The coming flood to destroy mankind,
But Noah found grace in the eyes of Jehovah:
Lord, make me like Noah,
Finding grace every day.
Grace is God Himself enjoyed by us
Through our cooperation
By calling, "Oh Lord Jesus.""}
