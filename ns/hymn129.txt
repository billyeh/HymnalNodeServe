{"1": "Lord, You are Beloved, Fairest of the fair;
Altogether lovely, unrivaled beauty;
It's You! Your presence, I long for and seek;
You're the One in Whom my heart delights,
So, I just love to tell You...",
"chorus": "Jesus, I love You,
My treasure, You are;
How could I choose anything less than You?
Dear Lord, my inmost heart
You've captured and won.",
"2": "Dead I was in sin Lord, so lost without You;
Helpless, wounded, weary, rebellious, too;
But Lord, You came! You would not let me go;
The blood and water flowed from Your side,
Constraining me to tell You...",
"3": "Thank You Lord, You opened my blind eyes to see
I was lame, but now I can walk; You healed me!
My leprosy, Lord, You cleansed all away;
My ears were opened to hear Your voice,
And now I follow You 'cause...",
"4": "Sometimes Lord, I'm drawn off by my selfish cares;
And the world it draws me with glitter and glare.
O Lord, You've trapped me. Don't let me go.
Kiss me and woo me, and win my heart,
So, I will always tell You...",
"5": "Keep my heart so soft, Lord, so open to You;
It would be the good ground to bear fruit for You;
Capture my friends Lord, and build us, I pray;
Your Bride, We'd match You in every way,
And corporately we tell You:",
"chorus": "Jesus, Come quickly,
We're waiting for You;
We're the virgins to You,
So single and true;
Forever and ever
Your counterpart true."}
