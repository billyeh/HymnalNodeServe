{"chorus": "Victory through Christ's resurrection
The victory is won!
Praise Him for what He has done
The victory is won!",
"1": "The victory over death,
Over Satan and the world
He defeated them triumphantly
For all to see,
Oh, what a victory!",
"2": "Designated as the Son
Bringing man into God
He uplifted humanity
Displayed His glory
Oh, what a victory!",
"3": "He became the Spirit too
So that He could dwell in us
He's dispensing into you and me
Now He's life-giving
Oh, what a victory!",
"4": "He regenerated us
Now we're brothers of the Lord
We're the members of His family
We're in the Body
Oh, what a victory!",
"5": "Now we partake of Him
In His victory we share
He's available to us daily
In God's economy
We're enjoying..."}
