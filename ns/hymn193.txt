{"1": "It is God's commandment and it is His desire
That His people call, call upon His name.
It's the joyful way, the joyful way to drink
From the fountain of God's rich salvation.
Calling is the way to delight oneself in God;
That is to enjoy Him, enjoy the Lord our God.
Hence, we as God's people, must daily call on Him.
This must be our practice for God's jubilee."}
