{"1": "Simply loving everyday;
Loving through a stormy way,
Even when my faith is small,
Loving Jesus, that is all.",
"chorus": "Loving as the moments fly,
Loving as the days go by,
Loving Him whate'er befall,
Loving Jesus, that is all.",
"2": "Brightly doth His Spirit shine
Into this poor heart of mine;
While He leads I cannot fall,
Loving Jesus, that is all.",
"3": "Singing if my way be clear,
Praying if the path be drear;
If in danger, for Him call,
Loving Jesus, that is all.",
"4": "Loving Him while life shall last,
Loving Him till earth is past,
Till His gracious advent call,
Loving Jesus, that is all."}
