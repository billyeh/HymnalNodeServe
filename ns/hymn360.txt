["nonum But if I delay,\nI write that you may know\nHow one ought to conduct\nHimself in the house of God,\nWhich is the church,\nThe church of the living God,\nThe pillar and base,\nThe pillar and base of the truth.", "chorus And confessedly,\nGreat is the mystery,\nThe mystery of godliness:\nAnd confessedly,\nGreat is the mystery,\nThe mystery of godliness:", "nonum He who was manifested in the flesh,\nJustified in the spirit,\nSeen by angels,\nPreached among the nations,\nBelieved on in the world,\nTaken up in glory.", "chorus And confessedly,\nGreat is the mystery,\nThe mystery of godliness:\nAnd confessedly,\nGreat is the mystery,\nThe mystery of godliness."]
