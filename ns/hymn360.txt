{"nonum": "But if I delay,
I write that you may know
How one ought to conduct
Himself in the house of God,
Which is the church,
The church of the living God,
The pillar and base,
The pillar and base of the truth.",
"chorus": "And confessedly,
Great is the mystery,
The mystery of godliness:
And confessedly,
Great is the mystery,
The mystery of godliness:",
"nonum": "He who was manifested in the flesh,
Justified in the spirit,
Seen by angels,
Preached among the nations,
Believed on in the world,
Taken up in glory.",
"chorus": "And confessedly,
Great is the mystery,
The mystery of godliness:
And confessedly,
Great is the mystery,
The mystery of godliness."}
