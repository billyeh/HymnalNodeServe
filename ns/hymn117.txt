With you to build up His Body.
Christ in you is the hope for me!
You also need Christ lived in me.",
"chorus": "I live, if you stand firm in the Lord.
You live, if I stand firm in the Lord.
My going on is for you,
Your going on is for me,
Not sep'rate entities,
I need you saints desp'rately!",

Built up in Him, His bride to be!
In Him steadfast, you help me be;
Encouraged by Christ whom I see.",

My progress depends upon you!
As I seek Christ, with you in view,
My heart, full of prayers, is for you.",

His lovers, seek Him corp'rately.
On each other spent constantly;
My life is for you, yours for me.",

Without your supply I would fall.
Never think that your Christ is small.
Christ needs you, and so do we all."}
