["1 If you wish to find the Lord,\nDo not seek Him in the world,\nFor the world is not the place in which He dwells.\nIn which He dwells, in which He dwells,\nIn which He dwells, in which He dwells,\nFor the world is not the place in which He dwells.", "2 If you wish to find the Lord,\nDo not seek Him in the mind,\nFor the mind can only know, it cannot taste.\nIt cannot taste, it cannot taste,\nIt cannot taste, it cannot taste,\nFor the mind can only know, it cannot taste.", "3 If you wish to find the Lord,\nYou must open up your heart,\nYou must open up your heart and let Him in.\nLet Him in, let Him in,\nLet Him in, let Him in,\nYou must open up your heart and let Him in.", "4 If you wish to let Him in,\nYou just call upon His name,\nYou just call upon His name and let Him in.\nCall His name, call His name,\nCall His name, call His name,\nYou just call upon His name and let Him in."]
