{"1": "If you wish to find the Lord,
Do not seek Him in the world,
For the world is not the place in which He dwells.
In which He dwells, in which He dwells,
In which He dwells, in which He dwells,
For the world is not the place in which He dwells.",
"2": "If you wish to find the Lord,
Do not seek Him in the mind,
For the mind can only know, it cannot taste.
It cannot taste, it cannot taste,
It cannot taste, it cannot taste,
For the mind can only know, it cannot taste.",
"3": "If you wish to find the Lord,
You must open up your heart,
You must open up your heart and let Him in.
Let Him in, let Him in,
Let Him in, let Him in,
You must open up your heart and let Him in.",
"4": "If you wish to let Him in,
You just call upon His name,
You just call upon His name and let Him in.
Call His name, call His name,
Call His name, call His name,
You just call upon His name and let Him in."}
