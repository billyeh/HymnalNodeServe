{"1": "It's a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord
And to sing praises unto our God.
It's a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord
And to sing praises unto our God.
To show forth Thy lovingkindness
In the morning and every night.
It's a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord.
To show forth Thy lovingkindness
In the morning and every night.
It's a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord."}
