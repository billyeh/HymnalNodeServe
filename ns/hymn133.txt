["1 I love my Master, and I will not go out free.\nFor He has died for me, the highest price He has paid for me.\nI love my Master, I will serve Him willingly. \nRemaining near, and close to Thee this my plea.", "chorus I love You Master, from You I will never leave.\nYou are my liberty, and my joy complete.\nI love my Master, and I will not go out free.\nTo Him I give my all, my life eternally!", "2 Oh Jesus, Master, to the door post now bring me.\nOpen my ears to hear, Your voice and all You say to me.\nOh Jesus, Master, I will obey willingly.\nTo love and serve Him all my life, this my plea!"]
