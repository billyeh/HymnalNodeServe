{"1": "I love my Master, and I will not go out free.
For He has died for me, the highest price He has paid for me.
I love my Master, I will serve Him willingly. 
Remaining near, and close to Thee this my plea.",
"chorus": "I love You Master, from You I will never leave.
You are my liberty, and my joy complete.
I love my Master, and I will not go out free.
To Him I give my all, my life eternally!",
"2": "Oh Jesus, Master, to the door post now bring me.
Open my ears to hear, Your voice and all You say to me.
Oh Jesus, Master, I will obey willingly.
To love and serve Him all my life, this my plea!"}
