["1 What a wonderful church life,\nAll the saints truly are one,\nNo matter where and who we are,\nWe are one!\nNothing can set us apart,\nFor we have the same life,\nAlthough Satan tried and tried,\nWe are one!", "chorus We are, we are, we are one in Christ!\nAbiding in the true vine,\nReceiving all the riches of the life divine,\nWe are one!\nWe are, we are, we are one in Christ!\nGrowing in the tree of life,\nIn Him we fellowship unto eternal life,\nWe are one!", "2 What a glorious church life,\nChrist in us has made us one,\nEating the tree of life,\nWe are one!\nHow can we ever depart\nSuch a sweet and blessed life?\nChrist in us and we in Christ!\nWe are one!"]
