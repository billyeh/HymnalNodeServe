["1 Though the world may promise me more,\nI'm just made to be filled with the Lord.\nNor it's life worth living a day,\nFor the things that will soon pass away.\nDoesn't matter how rich or successful I'd be,\nOr how many pleasures be offered to me.\nThere's nothing that compares to my destiny-\nTo be thoroughly filled with the Lord.", "2 Now although I'm still kind of small,\nAnd the future is in front of me.\nIn my heart I've heard the Lord's call,\nJust to follow Him absolutely.\nThough the path may be holding\nMuch joy or much pain,\nWhat matters is that more of Him I would gain,\nRegardless what happens,\nI never would change.\n'Cause I'm made to be filled with the Lord.\nYes, I'm made to be filled with the Lord."]
