{"1": "Your love and beauty has drawn me;
To run after You lovingly.
In Your chambers I am brought,
Nourished by You, dear Lord.",
"chorus": "My Beloved, I belong to You.
My love, you're so beautiful.
We're the same in life and in nature,
United in love forever.",
"2": "I partake of Your nature divine,
I enjoy Your divine life to shine.
Renewed in submission sweet,
Rise up with You to meet.",
"3": "Viewing You like a dove uniquely,
Trusting You singly as a lily.
Transformed and built up to be
Your rest and joy wholly.",
"4": "Let us go to the fields, my Beloved,
Working here with You, Lord, in love.
Your queen longs to be matured,
And hopes to be raptured.",
"chorus": "Set me as a seal on Your heart,
In Your love, keep me-ne'er apart.
Lord, make haste, I long for Your coming,
Come quickly, Beloved, we're waiting!"}
