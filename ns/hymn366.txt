{"1": "My heart longs for absolute surrender
That I'd wholly consecrated be,
Not in word alone but all my being
Would be fully given unto Thee.",
"2": "There is little willingness within me
To place all I am before Thy feet,
So I lay my hands on Thy dear head, Lord
As the burnt off'ring, perfect, complete.",
"3": "Lord, You are the only One who offered
Yourself without reluctance unto God;
Full obedience to the Father given,
Absolute, You sacrificed Your all.",
"4": "As this One, You're dwelling in my spirit;
Moving, spreading outward day by day.
There's a whisper of Amen within me
In response to all that You would say.",
"5": "I say Yes and give You full permission
To touch every corner of my heart;
Break through all the barriers in my being;
Do not let me withhold any part.",
"6": "'Tis my joy to give You all the ground, Lord;
Make my heart a dwelling place for You;
I want You to be at home within me;
Come and settle down in every room.",
"7": "Lord, do cleanse my heart from all self-seeking
That I'd truly want nothing but Thee;
Let my soul be occupied, possessed, Lord,
That You would be magnified in me."}
