["1 My heart longs for absolute surrender\nThat I'd wholly consecrated be,\nNot in word alone but all my being\nWould be fully given unto Thee.", "2 There is little willingness within me\nTo place all I am before Thy feet,\nSo I lay my hands on Thy dear head, Lord\nAs the burnt off'ring, perfect, complete.", "3 Lord, You are the only One who offered\nYourself without reluctance unto God;\nFull obedience to the Father given,\nAbsolute, You sacrificed Your all.", "4 As this One, You're dwelling in my spirit;\nMoving, spreading outward day by day.\nThere's a whisper of Amen within me\nIn response to all that You would say.", "5 I say Yes and give You full permission\nTo touch every corner of my heart;\nBreak through all the barriers in my being;\nDo not let me withhold any part.", "6 'Tis my joy to give You all the ground, Lord;\nMake my heart a dwelling place for You;\nI want You to be at home within me;\nCome and settle down in every room.", "7 Lord, do cleanse my heart from all self-seeking\nThat I'd truly want nothing but Thee;\nLet my soul be occupied, possessed, Lord,\nThat You would be magnified in me."]
