{"1": "New Jerusalem-the ultimate sign;
The ultimate goal of God's economy;
An incorp'ration, 'tis human-divine;
Through deification, this building we'll be.",
"2": "In constitution, nothing physical; 
Fully organic and everything of life.
In reality, fully spiritual;
In our living and work, at this we'll arrive.",
"3": "New Jerusalem in all its aspects
Was fully realised by the Lord's apostles
In their living and work in all respects;
O what a pattern to all His disciples!",
"4": "Its base, its gates, its wall, its foundations,
Its throne, its temple, its light and its supply-
All are shown as signs in Revelation,
Their rich significance we cannot deny.",
"5": "No more other goals; one work, one living:
Reaching the highest point where we'll be the same;
No more flesh, no more natural being;
Going up step by step, God's goal to attain."}
