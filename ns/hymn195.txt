["1 Breathing in the Lord\nIs how we live today.\nNot by thinking do we live,\nBut breathing is the way.\nWe just call \"O Lord!\"\nFrom very deep within,\nAnd with joy we testify\nWe're breathing in of Him.\nBreathe in Christ,\nBreathe in Life,\nBreathe Him in today!\nHe's our very life supply,\nSo breathe Him right away! (Repeat)", "2 He's so wonderful,\nThe Breath of Life is He;\nOnce he simply was a man,\nBut now He's breath to me.\nHe has changed His form;\nThe Spirit now is He.\nHe's the Christ breathed out from God,\nThe Breath breathed in by me.\nEverywhere, everywhere,\nChrist is life to me;\nI just call upon His name,\nAnd breath comes into me! (Repeat)"]
