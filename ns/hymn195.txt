{"1": "Breathing in the Lord
Is how we live today.
Not by thinking do we live,
But breathing is the way.
We just call "O Lord!"
From very deep within,
And with joy we testify
We're breathing in of Him.
Breathe in Christ,
Breathe in Life,
Breathe Him in today!
He's our very life supply,
So breathe Him right away! (Repeat)",
"2": "He's so wonderful,
The Breath of Life is He;
Once he simply was a man,
But now He's breath to me.
He has changed His form;
The Spirit now is He.
He's the Christ breathed out from God,
The Breath breathed in by me.
Everywhere, everywhere,
Christ is life to me;
I just call upon His name,
And breath comes into me! (Repeat)"}
