{"1": "Lord, I give myself to You again today
Lord, on this consecration path I choose to stay
You bought me with a price
My life I sacrifice
Lord, I am not my own.",
"2": "Lord, I give myself to You again today
Your mercy reached me though I was so far away
You gave Yourself for me
From whose earthly dreams You freed
Lord, I am Yours alone.",
"3": "Lord, I give myself to You again today
I open to You so that You may have a way
To work in me that I
Might serve You my whole life
Lord, I love You alone."}
