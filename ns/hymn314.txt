{"1": "And they sing a new song, saying:
You are worthy to take the scroll
And to open its seals, for You were slain and have purchased for God
By Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
Men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation",
"chorus": "And have made them a kingdom and priests to our God;
And they will reign on the earth,
And they will reign on the earth.",
"2": "You are worthy,
You were slain,
You have purchased men for God
Out of every
Tribe and tongue
And people and nation."}
