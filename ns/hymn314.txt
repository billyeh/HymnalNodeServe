["1 And they sing a new song, saying:\nYou are worthy to take the scroll\nAnd to open its seals, for You were slain and have purchased for God\nBy Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,\nMen out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation", "chorus And have made them a kingdom and priests to our God;\nAnd they will reign on the earth,\nAnd they will reign on the earth.", "2 You are worthy,\nYou were slain,\nYou have purchased men for God\nOut of every\nTribe and tongue\nAnd people and nation."]
