{"nonum": "For which cause, I remind you
To fan into flame the gift of God
Which is in you
Through the laying on of my hands,
You fan into flame the gift of God,
Which is in you.",
"chorus": "For God has not given us
A spirit of cowardice,
But of power and of love
And of sobermindedness.",
"nonum": "Do not be, be not ashamed
Of the testimony of our Lord
Nor of me;
Suffer with me and with the gospel,
It's the testimony of our Lord
For the gospel."}
