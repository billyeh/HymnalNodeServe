{"1": "You fill me Lord Jesus
You enlighten my darkness;
Your life brings me freedom
Your love heals my pain
Your dream is my treasure;
Your majesty awes me
You've filled me Lord Jesus
Come fill me again.",
"2": "Let Your north wind blow on me,
Let Your Spirit surround me
'Til my being is open, trusting You once again.
Then burn and consume me
With Your jealous God's fire
'Til me being is obedient,
'Til my soul You have gained.",
"3": "I will turn my heart to You;
Seal and pledge Yourself in me.
Mingle with me completely
Like the fire in the flame;
Til my being is glowing;
Your workmanship showing;
I will turn my heart to You
Again and again."}
