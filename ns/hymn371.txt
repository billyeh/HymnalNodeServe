{"1": "My inner parts have yearned for Him;
To my Beloved I now open;
My Beloved's gone, He has withdrawn,
I open but He was gone.",
"chorus": "I am sick with love, I am sick with love for Him.
If you find Him, please tell Him that
I am sick with love for Him.",
"2": "I sought Him but I found Him not.
I called Him yet He answered not.
If you find my love please tell Him that
I'm sick with love for Him."}
