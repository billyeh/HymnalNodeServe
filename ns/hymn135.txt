["1 Thank You, Lord Jesus, for dying for me.\nIt's Your precious blood cleansing all iniquities.\nIt's there on the cross where You bled and died for me.\nLord Jesus, I thank You, I'm fully justified in Thee.", "chorus Lord Jesus, I love You,\nYou're precious to me.\nIt's here in Your presence,\nI've seen Your beauty.\nYou're matchless, You're priceless,\nYou're everything to me.\nI'll love You forever-\nYou are the only One for me.", "2 Daily I come to be supplied by Your word.\nIt's by this supply that I'm richly satisfied.\nIt's here that I'm strengthened to live the Christian life.\nIt's nothing I do, but Your overflowing grace to me.", "3 Each day as I wake up I come to You, Lord.\nOur fellowship sweet must be daily restored.\nVoid of offense, keep my conscience so pure.\nSoften me, Lord, so that You alone may have my heart."]
