{"1": "Draw me, Lord;
Lest these earthly cares consume
My driven soul.
Move me Lord;
As a coursing river turns
Within Thine hands.",
"chorus": "Draw me, Lord!
Draw me, Lord!",
"2": "Capture me;
Be the conqueror of this
Wild, charging mare.
Win me Lord,
And subdue all pow'r of self
To yield to Thee.",
"3": "Draw me, Lord;
Ev'ry heartbeat tends to drift
My course from Thee.
Draw me, Lord;
I would gladly let Thee win
And yield my sword.",
"4": "Draw me, Lord;
Oh, Thy love compels me as
An ocean's tide!
Draw me, Lord;
For Thy drawing maketh hearts
To fast pursue."}
