{"chorus": "O Lord Jesus, Precious Jesus, Rescue me, Savior.
O Lord Jesus, Precious Jesus, Rescue me, Savior.",
"1": "You have come as light to me, Jesus, my Lord;
That I shall not be in darkness from now and on.
I was lost in sin, but then You came and restored my soul.
You left all to find me,
You received me with open arms,
All the angels sang and rejoiced,
Lovingly You treated me.
Father, I come back to You in Your light."}
