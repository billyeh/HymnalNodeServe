["1 How I love Your reigning life, Lord.\nHow I love abundant grace.\nHow I love to have Your presence,\nAs I live before Your face.", "chorus By Your life, Lord, I am reigning.\nI am over, over everything.\nAs I'm joyfully confessing,\nJesus, as my Lord and King.", "2 Sin, you helpless little fellow,\nLost your pow'r on Calvary.\nI have made exchange of masters,\nNow it's Christ who rules in me.", "3 World, with all your little trappings,\nYou oppress with doubts and cares.\nI have found a new provider,\nMy anxiety He bears.", "4 Self, you cruel manipulator,\nYou are wholly crucified,\nI have no more need to struggle,\nIn Christ's vict'ry I abide!", "5 Lord, when You return in glory,\nWhen You then the kingdom bring;\nBy Your life my Lord then make me\nManifested as a king."]
