{"1": "How I love Your reigning life, Lord.
How I love abundant grace.
How I love to have Your presence,
As I live before Your face.",
"chorus": "By Your life, Lord, I am reigning.
I am over, over everything.
As I'm joyfully confessing,
Jesus, as my Lord and King.",
"2": "Sin, you helpless little fellow,
Lost your pow'r on Calvary.
I have made exchange of masters,
Now it's Christ who rules in me.",
"3": "World, with all your little trappings,
You oppress with doubts and cares.
I have found a new provider,
My anxiety He bears.",
"4": "Self, you cruel manipulator,
You are wholly crucified,
I have no more need to struggle,
In Christ's vict'ry I abide!",
"5": "Lord, when You return in glory,
When You then the kingdom bring;
By Your life my Lord then make me
Manifested as a king."}
