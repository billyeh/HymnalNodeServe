{"1": "From the moment I first met Thee,
How my heart was filled with joy.
Hallelujah! Full joy in me,
As Thou flood me without alloy.
Oh the sweetest love is this first love;
Jesus, O Jesus my love!
Far excelling all other loves,
Such love reaches me.
Such a sweet love, such a true love-
Jesus, O Jesus my love!"}
