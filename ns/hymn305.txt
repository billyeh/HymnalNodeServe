["1 From the moment I first met Thee,\nHow my heart was filled with joy.\nHallelujah! Full joy in me,\nAs Thou flood me without alloy.\nOh the sweetest love is this first love;\nJesus, O Jesus my love!\nFar excelling all other loves,\nSuch love reaches me.\nSuch a sweet love, such a true love-\nJesus, O Jesus my love!"]
