["1 Jesus Lord, I just love You.\nYou've attracted me, and my heart renewed.\nI pursue You like a dove;\nI belong to You, and You're my Beloved.\nEverything under the sun is vanity:\nIt's like chasing after wind, so emptily;\nYou have put within me, Lord, eternity...", "2 Now I rise to come away;\nIn the cleft rock, Lord, I would ever stay.\nKiss me, Lord; refresh me, too,\nAs I gaze at You, and Your death I view.\nYou were broken on the cross for me, dear Lord.\nAll Your being, life and love for me was poured.\nPrecious One, You are the One that I adore...", "3 Make me, Lord, a fragrance true,\nAs a garden filled, with Your spices new.\nTransform me, Your Bride to be,\nFor Your heart's desire, through eternity.\nAs Your lover in the veil, I long to be,\nBe conformed to Your sweet death continually,\n'Til Your city we become eternally."]
