{"1": "God realized by us,
With Christ identified-
God reconciled us to Himself,
Now Christ, identified!",
"2": "Born into Adam, we-
But transferred now to Christ;
Made one with Christ, as baptized ones,
Growing togeth'r with Him.",
"3": "In likeness of His death,
That is, newness of life-
Ourselves be reckoned dead to sin,
But live to God, in Christ.",
"4": "We would present ourselves,
To God, from dead-alive.
Present our members "righteous slaves,"
Become thus sanctified."}
