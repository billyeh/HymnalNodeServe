["1 God wants His holy people to become His army;\nRise up, all ages! March on for His testimony;\nChrist is our meaning of life, testimony and center,\nIn everything He's the way, the goal and the Leader.", "2 For God to gain His army, priesthood, and dwelling place,\nDefilement must be dealt with, that to Him we'd be chaste,\nMake us the same as You, Lord, truly righteous and holy,\nMeeting Your strict requirements, becoming Your army.", "3 In our journey to gain Christ-the good land giv'n by God,\nHindrances and trials would come when we walk with the Lord,\nThrough suff'rings we'd be humbled and in spirit contrite,\nAnd be exposed through testing, thus purged and purified.", "4 To inherit the good land, we must be renumbered;\nMake a willing vow to Him to fulfill His standard.\nFor the Lord's up-to-date move, let's fight and pay the price,\nEnter and possess the land, our all-inclusive Christ!"]
