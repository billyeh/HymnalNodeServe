{"1": "Buried? Yes, but it is seed
From which Continents may feed;
Millions yet may bless the day
When that seed was laid away.",
"2": "Buried! hidden! out of sight!
Dwelling in the deepest night;
Losing, underneath the sod,
Everything, except its God.",
"3": "Buried, unremember'd, lost
So thinks man: "but all the cost
God has counted to display
Life abundant one glad day.",
"4": "Art thou buried? God's pure seed
Doth thy heart in silence bleed?
Change thy sighing into song,
Thus alone can harvests come."}
