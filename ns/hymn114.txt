["1 Nothing's quite so precious\nAs Jesus in my spirit.\nHe takes away the care\nAnd fills me with His peace.\nHe never leaves me,\nE'en as the days grow weary.\nHis presence goes with me.\nMy soul delights to hide in His arms.", "chorus I call His name, \"Lord Jesus,\nHelp me in my weakness.\"\nSo faithfully each day in me\nHe proves His life is so sufficient.", "2 Nothing's quite so precious\nAs Jesus in my spirit.\nHe turns my heart to Him,\nTo feast upon His life.\nIt's nothing I do-\nHis mercy's just upon me.\nAnd God's free gift of grace\nBecomes an endless joy to me."]
