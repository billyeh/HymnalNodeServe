["1 Who can be entrusted, God's gospel spread,\nWilling to respond, be commissioned, sent?\nHis love's constraining me, 'tis I no more,\nThis day my response bursts forth: \"Send me, Lord!", "chorus How I long to live this gospel life,\nAfresh consecrate, spread Christ with might,\nRespond to His call, press boldly forward, following the Lamb,\nKnock on every door! Lord, may You quickly come!", "2 In life and in death, in love mutually \nStanding in one spirit, co-laboring,\nOnly for the Body of Christ, and not for self,\nForming His victorious Bride, age turning."]
