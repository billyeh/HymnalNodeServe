{"1": "Who can be entrusted, God's gospel spread,
Willing to respond, be commissioned, sent?
His love's constraining me, 'tis I no more,
This day my response bursts forth: "Send me, Lord!",
"chorus": "How I long to live this gospel life,
Afresh consecrate, spread Christ with might,
Respond to His call, press boldly forward, following the Lamb,
Knock on every door! Lord, may You quickly come!",
"2": "In life and in death, in love mutually 
Standing in one spirit, co-laboring,
Only for the Body of Christ, and not for self,
Forming His victorious Bride, age turning."}
