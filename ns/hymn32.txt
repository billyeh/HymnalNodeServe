["chorus The processed and consummated Triune God,\nAccording to the good pleasure of His desire\nAnd for the highest intention in His economy,\nIs building Himself into His chosen people\nAnd His chosen people into Himself\nThat He may have a constitution in Christ\nAs the mingling of divinity with humanity\nTo be His organism and the Body of Christ\nAs His eternal expression and the mutual abode\nFor the redeeming God and the redeemed man.\nThe ultimate consummation of this miraculous structure of treasure\nWill be the New Jerusalem for eternity."]
