{"chorus": "The processed and consummated Triune God,
According to the good pleasure of His desire
And for the highest intention in His economy,
Is building Himself into His chosen people
And His chosen people into Himself
That He may have a constitution in Christ
As the mingling of divinity with humanity
To be His organism and the Body of Christ
As His eternal expression and the mutual abode
For the redeeming God and the redeemed man.
The ultimate consummation of this miraculous structure of treasure
Will be the New Jerusalem for eternity."}
