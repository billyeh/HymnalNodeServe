{"1": "Christ's divinity is glorious indeed;
Was concealed in Him as in a grain of wheat.
While incarnated, He was pressed, constrained
For the release of His glory within.",
"chorus": "Incorporation! Incorporation-
The issue of Christ's glorification.
In our daily walk, we must join to Him
And must live in Him, and work as one with Him.",
"2": "Christ was glorified through death on the cross;
Releasing His glory-'tis not a loss!
He became the Spirit for life-giving
As the last Adam for His dispensing.",
"3": "In resurrection, Christ was born to be
God's firstborn Son with humanity.
Through resurrection, many sons were born;
Christ the Lord Spirit, their being He will transform.",
"4": "His believers were regenerated;
God and man are thus incorporated.
Tis accomplished through Christ's resurrection
For His divine, glorious multiplication.",
"5": "Three aspects rest in this incorporation:
The Father's house for His satisfaction,
The true vine for His multiplication,
The child of the Spirit for His move on earth."}
