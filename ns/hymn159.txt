["1 Christ's divinity is glorious indeed;\nWas concealed in Him as in a grain of wheat.\nWhile incarnated, He was pressed, constrained\nFor the release of His glory within.", "chorus Incorporation! Incorporation-\nThe issue of Christ's glorification.\nIn our daily walk, we must join to Him\nAnd must live in Him, and work as one with Him.", "2 Christ was glorified through death on the cross;\nReleasing His glory-'tis not a loss!\nHe became the Spirit for life-giving\nAs the last Adam for His dispensing.", "3 In resurrection, Christ was born to be\nGod's firstborn Son with humanity.\nThrough resurrection, many sons were born;\nChrist the Lord Spirit, their being He will transform.", "4 His believers were regenerated;\nGod and man are thus incorporated.\nTis accomplished through Christ's resurrection\nFor His divine, glorious multiplication.", "5 Three aspects rest in this incorporation:\nThe Father's house for His satisfaction,\nThe true vine for His multiplication,\nThe child of the Spirit for His move on earth."]
