{"1": "Lord, I still love You,
Though it seems, sometimes, hard to do.
So many things, in all my life
I do not understand. Oh my Lord,
I need You. I love You.",
"2": "Lord, the church-Your Bride,
You've included me-qualified!
So, in the whole wide world,
My city, home, and heart-Spread dear Lord,
House to house, for whom You've died."}
