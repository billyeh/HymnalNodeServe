["nonum Lord, nothing but Thy smiling presence will satisfy me.\nI do not want anything but the smile of Thy glorious face.\nAs long as I have this,\nI care not whether the heaven comes down\nor the earth falls apart.\nThe whole world may rise up against me,\nbut as long as I have Thy smile upon me,\nI can praise Thee, I can praise Thee,\nand everything is well."]
