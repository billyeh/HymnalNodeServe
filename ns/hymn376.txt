{"nonum": "Lord, nothing but Thy smiling presence will satisfy me.
I do not want anything but the smile of Thy glorious face.
As long as I have this,
I care not whether the heaven comes down
or the earth falls apart.
The whole world may rise up against me,
but as long as I have Thy smile upon me,
I can praise Thee, I can praise Thee,
and everything is well."}
