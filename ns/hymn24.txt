{"1": "Lord, You are more precious than silver;
Lord, You are more costly than gold;
Lord, You are more beautiful than diamonds;
And nothing I desire compares with You.",
"2": "Lord, Your life is divine, eternal.
Lord, Your life regenerated me.
Lord, Your life is growing within me,
Until I am fully conformed to Thee.",
"3": "Lord, Your love is wide as the ocean.
Lord, Your love is deep as the sea.
Lord, Your love encompasses the nations,
And that is all I want to live in me.",
"4": "Lord, Your light is shining within us;
Lord, Your light drives darkness away.
Lord, Your light is guiding us onwards,
Preparing us for the coming wedding day."}
