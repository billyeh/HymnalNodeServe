{"1": "The risen Christ my Shepherd is.
He graciously my soul doth feed.
My Christ is mine, and I am His.
How can I lack or e'er have need?",
"2": "In pastures green He makes me lie.
My soul He satisfies always,
The restful water leads me by,
In fellowship and perfect peace.",
"3": "I often stray; He seeketh me
To yield my heart to His control.
For His name's sake He leadeth me
And shepherds my oft-shaken soul.",
"4": "Incredible the thought beside-
Pursuing Thee all care is stilled.
Thy rod and staff support and guide;
My way is with Thy presence filled.",
"5": "Emboldened in Thy victory,
I feast surrounded by my foes,
My head anointed bountifully,
My cup with blessings overflows.",
"6": "Thy love the measure of my days,
Thy grace a boundless treasure store;
Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise
Within Thy house forevermore."}
