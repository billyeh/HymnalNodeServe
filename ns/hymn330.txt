{"1": "Turn, turn my heart to You;
Lord, I confess my heart is untrue.
Turn, turn my wandering heart;
Lord, unto me Thy love impart.",
"chorus": "Lord, I call,
I call on Thee.
You're the only One for me!",
"2": "Rich, rich, He's rich to all,
Rich unto all that call on His name.
Rich, rich, He's rich, so call;
Now and forever, Jesus the same.",
"3": "Love, love, the love of God
Flows as a river, full to the brim.
Love, love, I'm filled with love,
Crazy in love with Jesus within."}
