{"1": "I love You,
Always and forever more,
For in darkness where I lived in death
You showed Your light to me.",
"2": "Yes, I love You,
And that is what You are,
For this love You suffered death for me
And the world to be redeemed.",
"chorus": "Though I'm worth no more than dust,
In Your eyes I am prized.
Your mercy purchased me
From my sin and my death.
You are love, You are love.",
"3": "I love You,
I give my all to You,
All my mind, my heart and all my strength
I'll offer all to You.",
"4": "Lord, I love You,
And now You live in me,
Oh Lord, strengthen me to take my cross
To follow You each day.",
"chorus": "Now I learn to call Your name.
Oh, Your riches come in
As my grace, reality,
My life and destiny.
You are love, You are love.",
"nonum": "Though my sins are colored scarlet,
You have cleansed them white as snow;
With Your blood poured out on Calvary,
My redemption will always be.
Lord, I need You and You'll always be
My life through eternity.
Lord, I love You. Yes, I love You.
I always will love You."}
