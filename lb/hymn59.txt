{"1": "I love You, Lord Jesus,
You're worthy of my life.
I relinquish all control
And give You every right.
Only You, only You,
You're the One attracting me!
In all things, nothing may I see
Or want but You!",
"2": "Every concept, all desires,
I now forsake for You!
Shine on all that I can't see,
On all that is not You!
Live Your life, live Your life.
I've been crucified with You.
Every moment, I would live in oneness,
Lord, with You!",
"3": "When I struggle, grant me grace
To turn my eyes on You!
Keep my heart so close to You,
My love, so fresh and new!
Come in, Lord! Come in more!
I would seek none else but You!
All my life, my love, my all, I pour it,
Lord, on You!"}
