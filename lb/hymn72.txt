{"nonum": "Lord, I have given up my pride
And turned away from my arrogance
For I choose to follow You.
I'm not concerned with wonderful matters
Or subjects too difficult for me
For You're my only concern.
Instead I am content and at peace
As a child lies quietly
In its mother's arms.
Now my heart is peaceful within me.
Now my heart is peaceful within me.
Now my heart is peaceful within me."}
