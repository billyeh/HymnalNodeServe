["nonum Lord, I have given up my pride\nAnd turned away from my arrogance\nFor I choose to follow You.\nI'm not concerned with wonderful matters\nOr subjects too difficult for me\nFor You're my only concern.\nInstead I am content and at peace\nAs a child lies quietly\nIn its mother's arms.\nNow my heart is peaceful within me.\nNow my heart is peaceful within me.\nNow my heart is peaceful within me."]
