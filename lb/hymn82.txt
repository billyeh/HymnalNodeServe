{"1": "How could a country girl like me
Become Your match - Your bride to be?
You're holy and You are divine
But I'm fallen and human.

Without You, Lord, I have no chance
To be like You in this romance.
But You chose me ere the world began
Nothing could change Your plan.",
"chorus": "This divine romance
Is My heart's deep plan.
I became a lowly man
To court My country girl.",
"chorus": "Nothing could deter,
Nothing can alter
My eternal love for her;
I'll gain My country girl.",
"2": "No man or angel ever knew
This secret hidden deep in You
That You desired to be one with man
Before the world began.

Though sin came in to ruin me
Through Satan's scheme and subtlety
Nothing could break Your love for me
To gain me totally.",
"chorus": "This divine romance
Is My heart's deep plan,
I became a lowly man
To court My country girl.",
"chorus": "Nothing could deter,
Nothing can alter
My eternal love for her;
I'll gain My country girl.",
"3": "As King of kings You became a man,
You died for me-I've been redeemed,
In resurrection made us queen
To marry You, my King.

From death You 'rose and entered me,
I now possess Your divinity;
In life and nature we're the same:
Both human and divine.",
"chorus": "In Your love I'm drawn,
To You I belong;
I am not my own, Lord,
I'm Yours alone.",
"chorus": "By Your love I'm drawn,
In Your name I'm charmed,
And Your Person captured me,
For I've been kissed by Thee.",
"4": "Lord, in this close sweet fellowship,
Lord, be with me so intimate,
So personal and affectionate;
A sweet relationship.

Lord, daily change my inward being
Lord, all my heart possessing
In all my being-transforming
To be Your bride and queen.",
"chorus": "In Your love I'm drawn,
To You I belong;
I am not my own, Lord,
I'm Yours alone.",
"chorus": "By Your love I'm drawn,
In Your name I'm charmed,
And Your Person captured me,
For I've been kissed by Thee."}
