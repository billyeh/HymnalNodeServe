["1 In His shadow have I rapture and sit down;\nAnd His fruit is sweet to my taste.\nHe hath brought me to the house of wine,\nAnd His banner over me is love.\nSustain Ye me with raisin cakes,\nRefresh me with apples;\nFor I am sick with love.\nHis left hand is under my head,\nAnd His right hand doth embrace me."]
