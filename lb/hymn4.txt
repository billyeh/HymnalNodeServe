["1 Jesus, dear Jesus,\nYou're so glorious!\nYou're such a mystery.\nI've been captured by Thee.\nYou're the greatest attraction,\nAll-extensive, all-inclusive Person.\nYou're the Infinite, beyond measure,\nYet my portion, my priceless treasure.", "2 Jesus, dear Lord,\nYou're beyond man's word.\nYou're a God-man.\nYou're divine and human.\nYou're immortal with eternal might,\nYet became a mortal finite.\nYou're almighty, eternally the same,\nYet a man in time became.", "3 Jesus, dear Lord,\nYou partook blood and flesh.\nYou're the Eternal Word,\nGod in a man manifest.\nLord, You died for humanity\nTo redeem man for eternity.\nLord, You died on a tree for me.\nLord, You loved me eternally.", "4 Jesus, dear Christ,\nDeath can't hold You in the grave.\nNow You're the Spirit.\nYou can enter man to save.\nSatan plotted and killed You dead,\nThat destroyed him the devil instead.\nLord, You rose from the dead to be\nThe life-giving Spirit in me."]
