["1 As a lily growing out of a bramble bush;\nAs a bright star shining forth in the darkest night;\nIs a story excellent, bright and fragrant\nOf Boaz and Ruth in a divine romance.", "2 Ruth the Moabitess joined to God's holy elect;\nBoaz took care of her and redeemed all her debt.\nFirst she gleaned from his land,\nThen got married to him.\nThis is how she was joined to God's eternal plan.", "chorus Lord, I love You and treasure You.\nLord, I choose You and respond to You.\nYou're my everything, You're above all,\nYou're my Husband, and my rest,\nAnd my all in all.", "3 The eternal God entered and stepped into time;\nFor this He needed persons to carry the line -\nThose who fulfilled His plan, to bring God into man\nBringing divinity into humanity.", "4 In the universe this is the greatest event,\nThat is Christ's incarnation - in His first advent.\nRuth became an ancestor in this mystery -\nGod and man to be mingled as one entity.", "5 God had promised the seed of a woman for man\nThat would crush Satan's head and redeem fallen man;\nTo make God and man one, what a glory to Him!\nWe are qualified now to partake of Him.", "6 We are Moabites too, constituted with sin;\nWe are under God's wrath and His condemnation.\nBut through Christ's redemption, He's our portion we claim;\nIn this organic union, we're married to Him."]
