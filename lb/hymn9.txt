{"1": "Oh, Jesus, Jesus, wonderful Jesus
Who art enthroned in heav'n above,
Crowned both with glory and with honor,
Attract us by Thy charming love.",
"chorus": "Oh! Jesus, Jesus, most desired,
Oh! Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord,
Thy charming beauty us hath captured,
We love, we love Thee, precious Lord.",
"2": "Thy glory is the splendor related
To Thy dear Person, Jesus Lord;
While honor is the preciousness
Related to Thine own great worth.",
"3": "Thou art, dear Lord, the greatest attraction,
Within the universe to see,
And like unto an immense magnet,
Drawing Thy seekers unto Thee.",
"4": "Without Thyself, the charming Object,
How could we from all things turn 'way?
How could we from so many distractions
Upon this earth, Lord, look away?"}
