["1 Oh, Jesus, Jesus, wonderful Jesus\nWho art enthroned in heav'n above,\nCrowned both with glory and with honor,\nAttract us by Thy charming love.", "chorus Oh! Jesus, Jesus, most desired,\nOh! Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord,\nThy charming beauty us hath captured,\nWe love, we love Thee, precious Lord.", "2 Thy glory is the splendor related\nTo Thy dear Person, Jesus Lord;\nWhile honor is the preciousness\nRelated to Thine own great worth.", "3 Thou art, dear Lord, the greatest attraction,\nWithin the universe to see,\nAnd like unto an immense magnet,\nDrawing Thy seekers unto Thee.", "4 Without Thyself, the charming Object,\nHow could we from all things turn 'way?\nHow could we from so many distractions\nUpon this earth, Lord, look away?"]
