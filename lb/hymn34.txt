{"1": "The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.
He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
He leads me beside still waters.",
"2": "He restores my soul: "He guides me.
In the paths of righteousness
For His Name's sake.",
"3": "Even though I walk through the valley,
The valley of the shadow of death;
Even though I walk through the valley,
The valley of the shadow of death;
I fear no evil for Thou art with me;
Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.",
"4": "Thou dost prepare a table for me
In the presence of mine enemies
And anointest my head with oil.",
"5": "Only goodness and mercy will follow me
All the days of my life,
Only goodness and mercy will follow me
All the days of my life,
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."}
