{"1": "When we are with unveiled face
Beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord,
He infuses us with the elements
Of what He is and of what He has done.",
"chorus": "But we all with unveiled face,
Beholding and reflecting
Like a mirror the glory of the Lord,
Are being transformed
Into the same image
From glory to glory,
Even as from the Lord Spirit.",
"2": "Thus we are being transformed
Metabolic'lly to have His life-shape
By His life-pow'r with His life-essence,
Transfigured by renewing our mind."}
