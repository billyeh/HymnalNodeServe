{"1": "Jesus, Lord Jesus!
Lord, You're rich to all,
Unto those who call
Your highest name above all.

Jesus, Lord Jesus!
Oh, Your name most precious!
Lord, You are so glorious!
Lord, You're so marvelous!",
"chorus": "Highest name above all names!
Call on Him and He will save.
Jesus, Lord Jesus,
Oh most precious name!",
"2": "Jesus, Lord Jesus!
Why would Christians feel ashamed
And not call Your precious name?
That is the devil's scheme.

Jesus, Lord Jesus!
All my friends they tell me
I have changed completely.
You satisfy me thoroughly.",
"3": "Jesus, Lord Jesus!
Calling Your dear Person,
Once I was opposing,
But now I am enjoying.

Jesus, Lord Jesus!
Let me call You all day long.
To the world that's something wrong.
Your precious name, the sweetest song.",
"4": "Jesus, Lord Jesus!
Oh, the devil's trembling!
When we all start calling
The enemy we're crushing!

Jesus, Lord Jesus!
Lord, You're not a doctrine
In the mind for thinking
But Your dear name's so refreshing!",
"5": "Jesus, Lord Jesus!
How I love to touch You!
It's by calling on You!
No other One will do!

Jesus, Lord Jesus!
As I call, I'm drinking,
Triune God partaking.
Lord, You're my cup of salvation!"}
