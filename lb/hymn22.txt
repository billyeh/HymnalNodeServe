{"1": "Shepherd, receive man,
Come near and eat with them,
Publicans and sinners.
Go out to carry them home
On Your shoulders, rejoicing.
Lord, carry them home.",
"2": "Spirit, dear Spirit,
Where is the one lost coin?
Yes, You have the nine,
But the one You must find.
Dear Spirit, You're sweeping
All over the earth.",
"3": "Father, dear Father,
Have mercy on mankind!
He's fallen to the pigs' pen.
When will he return?
Dear Father, just kiss them,
Your sons coming home.",
"4": "Father of mercy,
Clothe him with the best robe
And kill the fatted calf
And eat and be merry -
He was lost, but found,
Was dead, but now he lives."}
