{"1": "Now from my heart comes,
A happy song;
It's just for You, Lord,
There's only One:
J-E-S-U-S, I love You.",
"chorus": "How I long to sing
With my spirit and heart to You.
Jesus, You're so rich;
In who You are and what You do.
Ev'ry time I turn and open up,
I drink of You.
'Cause I love You.",
"2": "I've seen how they,
Pierced Your side,
You gave Your all,
To win Your bride
J-E-S-U-S, I love You.",
"3": "Without Your love, Lord,
I'm so empty
Life has no meaning;
Just vanity,
J-E-S-U-S, Reality.",
"4": "Jesus in me.
What a wonder;
Bubbling over,
Living water.
J-E-S-U-S, What a joy!"}
