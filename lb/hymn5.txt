{"1": "The Bible is a romance
In the most holy sense:
God and His chosen people
In love it so presents.
This Universal Couple
Throughout it is displayed;
God in Christ is the Bridegroom,
His saints, the Bride, portrayed.",
"2": "Through shadows, types and figures,
God's deepest thought is known;
As typified by Adam,
The Husband, Christ, is shown.
A rib brought forth from Adam
Reveals the source of life
By which God built a woman:
Eve, as the church, His wife.",
"3": "To be His people's Husband,
To take them as His wife:
This is what God desires
To live in marriage life.
Their sacrifice and worship
Alone could not content;
But with them to be married
Was God's foremost intent.",
"4": "This romance is the finest
As seen in Song of Songs;
For her Beloved's kisses
His seeking lover longs.
Love's work in her produces
No person of her own,
But she becomes the City,
Her Person, Christ alone.",
"5": "Christ is our coming Bridegroom;
We are the Church, His Bride,
Redeemed, regenerated,
The issue of His side,
In source, in life, in nature
And person fully one,
His counterpart forever,
The New Jerusalem."}
