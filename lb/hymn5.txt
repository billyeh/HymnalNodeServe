["1 The Bible is a romance\nIn the most holy sense:\nGod and His chosen people\nIn love it so presents.\nThis Universal Couple\nThroughout it is displayed;\nGod in Christ is the Bridegroom,\nHis saints, the Bride, portrayed.", "2 Through shadows, types and figures,\nGod's deepest thought is known;\nAs typified by Adam,\nThe Husband, Christ, is shown.\nA rib brought forth from Adam\nReveals the source of life\nBy which God built a woman:\nEve, as the church, His wife.", "3 To be His people's Husband,\nTo take them as His wife:\nThis is what God desires\nTo live in marriage life.\nTheir sacrifice and worship\nAlone could not content;\nBut with them to be married\nWas God's foremost intent.", "4 This romance is the finest\nAs seen in Song of Songs;\nFor her Beloved's kisses\nHis seeking lover longs.\nLove's work in her produces\nNo person of her own,\nBut she becomes the City,\nHer Person, Christ alone.", "5 Christ is our coming Bridegroom;\nWe are the Church, His Bride,\nRedeemed, regenerated,\nThe issue of His side,\nIn source, in life, in nature\nAnd person fully one,\nHis counterpart forever,\nThe New Jerusalem."]
