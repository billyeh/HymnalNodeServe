{"1": "Lord, I love You.
Lord, I need You.
Lord, without You
Nothing would be the same.
Without You knowing,
Without You flowing,
Without You growing,
In me my life is vain.

Lord, I love You more and more;
I just want You.
Fill me with Your life and Your virtues.
Fill me 'til I'm only living You.
Fill me every minute, every hour, every day
Until I am expressing You always.
Fill this earthen vessel, Lord, I pray.",
"2": "Lord, You're moving,
Operating
In my being
Saturate every part.
You're infusing,
Permeating.
You're indwelling,
Making home in my heart.

Lord, I love You more and more;
I just want You.
Fill me with Your life and Your virtues.
Fill me 'til I'm only living You.
Fill me every minute, every hour, every day
Until I am expressing You always.
Fill this earthen vessel, Lord, I pray.",
"3": "Lord, You're building
Your expression;
Lord, by mingling
All that You are in me.
I'm responding,
Cooperating,
Consecrating
Myself to You totally.

Lord, for Your expression
I would now outpour,
Partaking of Your Person more and more,
Partaking of Your Person more and more.
Lord, for Your expression
I would now outpour,
This is what I was created for,
This is what I was created for."}
