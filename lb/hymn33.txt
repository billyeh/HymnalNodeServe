{"1": "My heart was far from You.
My worship was not true.
My lips were honoring Thee
But I was so empty.",
"chorus": "Lord, help me! Have mercy!
Lord, now deliver me!
All else is vanity.
You are reality!",
"2": "Traditions are a lie.
Mere practice can't satisfy.
No matter how hard you try
Inside you feel so dry.",
"chorus": "Lord water me! I'm so thirsty!
I come to drink of Thee.
You are the Spirit of life
To free me from all strive.",
"3": "The doctrines and the creeds
Have never met my needs.
The letters have killed me dead
My need is Living Bread.",
"chorus": "Lord, feed me! I'm so hungry!
I come to eat of Thee.
Your Person now I can take.
The Living Word partake.",
"4": "I need You desperately
To get You into me!
I drink You as the Spirit, Lord,
And eat You in the Word.",
"chorus": "I'm satisfied! And You're testified!
There is no lack in Thee.
You are the river and the tree,
My feast eternally."}
