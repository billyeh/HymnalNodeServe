["1 My heart was far from You.\nMy worship was not true.\nMy lips were honoring Thee\nBut I was so empty.", "chorus Lord, help me! Have mercy!\nLord, now deliver me!\nAll else is vanity.\nYou are reality!", "2 Traditions are a lie.\nMere practice can't satisfy.\nNo matter how hard you try\nInside you feel so dry.", "chorus Lord water me! I'm so thirsty!\nI come to drink of Thee.\nYou are the Spirit of life\nTo free me from all strive.", "3 The doctrines and the creeds\nHave never met my needs.\nThe letters have killed me dead\nMy need is Living Bread.", "chorus Lord, feed me! I'm so hungry!\nI come to eat of Thee.\nYour Person now I can take.\nThe Living Word partake.", "4 I need You desperately\nTo get You into me!\nI drink You as the Spirit, Lord,\nAnd eat You in the Word.", "chorus I'm satisfied! And You're testified!\nThere is no lack in Thee.\nYou are the river and the tree,\nMy feast eternally."]
