{"1": "Lord, I love You more and more each day.
Lord, I love You more this very day.
I can't live without You anymore.
I can't make it like I did before.",
"2": "Oh, those years when I was void of You.
Lord, You rescued me when I was through.
When I reminisce those other years,
Emptiness, heartaches, and many tears.",
"chorus": "Lord, I do love You more everyday.
Lord, I do love You much more this very day.",
"3": "Oh, that thirst that gnawed me deep within:
Drove me seeking satisfaction.
Oh, the many things that I have tried:
Left me thirsting and dissatisfied.",
"4": "In this endless search for something new,
All the time this cry was just for You.
I was blind in trying many things
'Til I drank You as my living Spring.",
"5": "Lord, You came and filled my inmostbeing.
You're the sweetest satisfaction.
You're the Spirit as my everything,
Spirit in my spirit bubbling.",
"6": "Thank You, Lord, for coming into me.
Now You're spreading in me constantly.
Lord, You're making home in all my heart,
As my treasure filling every part."}
