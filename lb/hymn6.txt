{"1": "And He showed me a river
Of water of life,
Bright as crystal,
Proceeding out
Of the throne of God
And of the Lamb.
And Thou shalt make them to drink
Of the river of Thy pleasures.",
"2": "There is a river,
The streams whereof make glad.
The city of God.
She shall not be moved.
God shall help her.
God's in her midst.
They shall be abundantly satisfied
With the fatness of Thy house."}
