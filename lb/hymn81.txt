{"1": "The greatest king on earth, that is King Solomon,
Fell in love with a country girl.
The king had to go to the countryside
And become a country man,
To change his status,
That he could court her.
In His courtship with her
She was changed to be his match,
To become his queen and Shulammite,
To become his counterpart
And become His loving bride.
This is the story of the Song of Songs.",
"2": "The Song of Songs depicts our story with God
Of fallen man with the King of kings.
Because of His love for us,
He became a lowly man
To reach us and to die for our sins.
Then in resurrection He
Regenerated me
And now we're daily being transformed.
To become the same as He with His life and nature
To become His counterpart, His match and bride."}
