{"1": "In Revelation see
God's final mystery;
Why God created you and me.
He predestinated me!
Our mutual destiny;
Christ and the churches are for me!",
"chorus": "In spirit we must be,
To hear His voice and see.
Turn to the Son of Man
In the golden lampstands.",
"2": "You're walking in her midst;
She is Your heart's interest.
To You, Lord, nothing else exists.
No, nothing can deter,
No person can alter
The love, dear Lord, You have for her.",
"chorus": "This mystery, Oh how great!
Oh, saints it's not too late!
All else is vanity;
Take this reality.",
"3": "Your eyes, a flame of fire.
To one, Lord, You aspire:
It's her, Lord, You completely desire.
The breastplate on Your chest,
Golden girdle on Your breast.
Your Bride: "on her Your heart is set!",
"chorus": "Saints, stand together
One with another.
Christ and the churches are
The end of our search.",
"4": "The speaking of Your voice
Trumpets Your single choice:
Oh Son of Man, Your gold lampstand.
Lord, keep me in Your hand
In the seven golden lampstands,
Shining You for Your eternal plan.",
"chorus": "We at Your feet do fall.
Have mercy on us all.
Your face, the shining sun,
Touch me, Oh Living One!",
"5": "You're never satisfied
Until You have Your Bride.
Our hearts with Yours must coincide;
Transfuse me with Your sense.
Your call is so immense.
Responding to Your love intense!",
"chorus": "Saints, open wide to Him!
Don't let this vision dim.
Lord, take our being!
Wreck us from everything!",
"6": "I hate to lukewarm be!
Lord, burn me thoroughly.
My first, My best, I come to Thee.
The seven Spirits burn,
Intensified to turn
My heart for You to be so firm.",
"chorus": "Grant me a hot pursuit!
All else in me uproot!
Oh Lord, do burn each part!
Grant me a fresh new start.",
"7": "Lord, be my first and best.
All else I would detest.
My all in You, Lord, I invest.
I now pour out on Thee.
Lord, You have conquered me.
You are my choice eternally.",
"chorus": "We're in the final stage,
The age of every age.
Oh Lord, in me advance!
Thank You for this last chance."}
