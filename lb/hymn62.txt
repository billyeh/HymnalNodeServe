{"1": "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
Our life is a life that's in organic union.
As a branch is in the vine,
Grafted, His life and mine intertwine.
Lord, I am joined to You!",
"chorus": "One spirit with You;
One spirit, not two.
Lord, we are joined to You:
One spirit... with You.",
"2": "Through resurrection the Lord is now the Spirit.
Our spirit by Him has been regenerated.
The Lord, the Spirit, mingling
With our spirit, is the most wondrous thing.
Our spirit's mingled, Lord!",
"3": "Do you not know that our bodies
are Christ's members?
This body's a temple of the Holy Spirit
Who, from God, is now inside,
Owning us that God may be glorified.
Lord, we've been bought by You!",
"4": "We are united with Christ in our spirit.
He dwells within us
and makes His home in our heart,
To our body giving life,
Purified to be a member of Christ;
Our every part is Christ!"}
