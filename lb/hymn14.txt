{"1": "Just one touch of You, dear Lord,
Just one look into Your eyes, 
Just one kiss from You,
You're all I need, my Love.

Let me hear again Your voice.
You are now my final choice.

I'll waste myself on Thee.",

	but You anymore.
Jesus, I love You, my only desire.
Oh Lord, I just love You.",
"2": "Let me touch You as before,
Craving for You more and more,
You're the very best!
I'll drop the rest for You.

Oh, the kisses of Your mouth
Make my lips to praise and shout.
Lord, You're full of grace
Oh, what a taste my Love!",

Jesus, my first Love, oh set me on fire
For You, my only desire.",

Oh! This union satisfies!
As I gaze on You.
I'm filled with You, my Love.

Only You alone will do.
I can't make it without You.
Keep me close to You,
Just joined to You as one.",

	but You anymore.
Jesus, I love You, my only desire.
Oh, set my heart on fire.",

Grant my heart for You to burn.
Flame in me this zeal.
Lord, be in me so real!

I repent and now return,
Grant my heart for You to burn.
Flame in me this zeal.
Lord, be in me so real!",
"chorus": "Jesus, my first Love! Oh Jesus, my best Love,

Jesus, my first Love! Oh Jesus, my best Love,
I love You. I just love You!"}
