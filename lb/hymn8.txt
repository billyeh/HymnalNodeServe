{"1": "We treasure Thee, Lord Jesus,
As God's reality.
Whate'er our God possesses
Is surely found in Thee.
His very life and essence
Within Thy Being dwells.
His glory and expression
Thy Person fully tells.",
"2": "Oh! Vast Unmeasured Portion,
Oh! Bountiful Supply,
In light the saints enjoy Thee,
And Thou dost reign thereby.
Within the Father's bosom
Beloved Son Thou art;
The sweetness of the Godhead
To us Thou dost impart.",
"3": "Most Excellent of mankind,
Creation's firstborn One!
God saw Thee and foreknew Thee,
The first created One.
Yet, twice to Thee 'tis given,
Yea, born and born again,
A man in resurrection,
The firstborn from the dead.",
"4": "The universal Fullness
So pleased resides in Thee.
Within Thee dwells the Godhead,
And Thou, Lord, dwell in me!
Preeminent, transcendent,
Unique in all Thou art,
O'erflowing all the heavens,
Thou now dost fill my heart!",
"5": "Thou art the hope of glory,
Thou art the mystery,
The center and the focus
Of God's economy;
The secret of the ages,
Veiled from eternity,
The hidden dispensation,
The Triune God in me!",
"6": "In all things Thou art foremost,
In everything the best,
In quality the finest,
In quantity boundless.
Superlative in nature,
In form resplendent Thou,
Surpassing e'en the highest,
The peerless One art Thou."}
