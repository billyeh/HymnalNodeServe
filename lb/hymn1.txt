{"1": "Let me stand behind You, Lord.
Let me wash Your feet with my tears.
Let me wipe them with my hair.
Let me kiss them and anoint them
With the ointment.

I love You!
Jesus, I love You!
May I waste my all and life on You.
Let me pour the ointment pure
On Your head and on Your feet,
On You, most precious One
Because I love You.",
"2": "Let me take a pound of ointment pure
Of great value to anoint Your feet
And wipe them with my hair
That the house be filled with the fragrance
Of the ointment.

I love You!
Jesus, I love You!
May I waste my all and life on You.
Let me pour the ointment pure
On Your head and on Your feet,
On You, most precious One
Because I love You.",
"3": "Lord, they said if You were a prophet,
You should know who and what I am.
I'm a sinner that toucheth You,
A woman not worthy to anoint You.

But I love You!
Jesus, I love You!
You forgave me the most",
now I love You, Lord, the most.
Let me pour the ointment pure
On Your head and on Your feet,
On You, most precious One,
Because You love me.",
"4": "Let my love from my being wash Your feet
And my glory without wipe them too
Let me kiss them where the nails would pierce.
All my love, Lord, and glory I'll waste on You.

I love You!
Jesus, I love You!
All my glory and love I pour
and waste on You.
Receive my ointment, Lord.
It's all I have, dear Lord.
For You, most precious One,
Because I love You."}
