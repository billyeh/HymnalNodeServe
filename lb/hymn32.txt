{"nonum": "Lord, we want to live You
In the most intimate
And the closest contact,
Closest contact with You.
Acting according
To the index of Your eyes;
A person one with Christ,
Full of Christ.",
"nonum": "And one who is saturated
with Christ
One who is so broken
And even terminated
In his natural life,
Softened and flexible
in his will,
Affectionate, yet restricted
in emotions,
Sober and considerate
in his mind,
And pure, genuine
in his spirit.",
"nonum": "This is for the benefit
Of all the believers
That they may experience
And enjoy Christ
For the fulfillment of God's purpose
In the building up of Christ's Body,
In the building up of Your Body."}
