{"1": "A lover of Christ should be one
Who's attracted by His love
And drawn by His sweetness
To pursue after Him, pursue after Him,
Pursue Him for full satisfaction.",
"2": "A lover of Christ should be one
Who is called by Him
To be delivered
From the self through His oneness
With the cross, with the cross of Christ.",
"3": "A lover of Christ should be one
Who is called by Him to live in ascension
As the new creation, creation of God,
In the resurrection of Christ.",
"4": "A lover of Christ should be one
Who's called by Him more strongly to live within
The veil, thru His cross after the lover's
Experience of His resurrection."}
