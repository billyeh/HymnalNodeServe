{"1": "What's the use? There is no hope for me,
Deep inside just fear and misery.
Man's enslaved by this haunting melody-
Everything, my friend, is temporary.",
"chorus": "There is an answer: "a wonderful Person!
He's Jesus the Lord; He's God's beloved Son!
This wonderful Person is now your solution.
Just take and receive Him; He's God's Firstborn Son!",
"2": "Day by day, I tried to stop this song.
What is it? There must be something wrong...
Oh! This life is just a hopelessness!
Always searching, but tasting emptiness.",
"chorus": "There is an answer: "a wonderful Person!
He's Jesus the Lord; He's God's beloved Son!
This wonderful Person is now your solution.
Just take and receive Him; He's God's Firstborn Son!",
"3": "All day long you play the "same ole song":
"Good morning", "How are you?", "No, there is nothing wrong."
You're swept by the world of deceptive vanity,
A tide looking good, but it's void of reality.",
"chorus": "Just call "Oh Lord Jesus": "the truth you're confessing
That God raised this Jesus from among the dead.
Your heart this believing, just call to receive Him.
He's Jesus the Savior, your great salvation.",
"4": "You're conformed to unreality,
Trapped in a wheel of human anxiety.
You are caught, you're in the web already.
You're spun to this song: "you're just the spider's prey.",
"chorus": "Jesus crushed the devil and overcame evil.
That kingdom He leveled and destroyed the devil.
He will free you from sin, from death, world and Satan.
Just call "Oh Lord Jesus" and He will enter in.",
"5": "Life is a song as a time hour glass,
Sand by sand, my friend it cannot last.
You're born, you live, and eventually you die.
Friend, you can't change it, no need to even try.",
"chorus": "There is a new song, a wonderful Person!
He's Jesus the Lord, He's God's beloved Son!
This wonderful Person is now your solution!
Just take and receive Him; He's God's Firstborn Son!"}
