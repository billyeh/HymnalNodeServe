["1 Thank You, Lord, You died for me.\nYou took my place upon the tree.\nAll my sins were laid on Thee;\nYou bore them all away...\nI was just an enemy,\nLost and sold to sin.\nBut You came to shed\nYour blood for me,\nYou the One with no sin!", "2 Many plotted to kill You,\nJudas he betrayed You.\nDisciples, they forsook You,\nFalse witnesses were hired.\nThen Peter, he denied You,\nThree times in one night.\nAn illegal trial condemned You.\nHow we afflicted You!", "3 They smote You with their palms,\nAnd spit into Your precious face.\nBuffeting and mocking,\nThey led You away!\nPilate and Herod\nSent You back and forth.\nThen the soldiers, they scourged You\nAnd made a crown of thorns.", "4 With a reed, they beat Your head,\nPressing the thorns much deeper.\nStripping You, they nailed You\nUp on a cross of wood.\nIn front of You, they gambled\nFor Your clothes and seamless coat.\nAll the people passed, despising You.\nThen God forsook You too!", "5 The two thieves on either side,\nAs they hung, reviled You.\nThough You were dead, a soldier\nStill would pierce Your side.\nBlood and water poured out,\nOut from Your broken heart.\nThat same blood and water saved me!\nLord, how I love You!", "6 When I see the price You paid,\nYou chose to pay my every debt!\nWillingly, You bore such shame\nAnd tasted death for me!\nHow could I ever love the world\nThat crucified You, dear One?\nI am not my own, bought with a price.\nI give myself to You!"]
