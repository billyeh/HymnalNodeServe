{"1": "Deep in God's heart there's been,
Before the time began,
God's desire to be expressed,
This He planned in eternal past.",
"chorus": "God eternal had a purpose
In eternal past.
He created man in His image
that man would God express.",
"2": "Genesis, the blueprint -
Revelation, the fulfillment -
From God's plan and economy
To the city in eternity.",
"3": "Man from the dust of the ground
At the end, New Jerusalem.
Here God's wisdom and love abound.
Oh! This is most profound!",
"4": "Deep in God's heart He planned
To mingle Himself with man.
God, as a river and a tree,
Man's food and drink to be.",
"5": "God our enjoyment
Issues the fulfillment:
A city as His expression
Built with gold, pearl and precious stones."}
