{"1": "I do not know where they have laid Him.
The stone is taken away from the tomb.
Oh! They have taken Him away!
Oh! Where is He?",
"2": "Disciples came and saw the empty tomb
But went away so soon to their own homes.
They're satisfied with just the facts.
But where's my Lord?",
"chorus": "Where is He, my Jesus?
Where is He, my Beloved?
Where is He Whom my soul doth love?
Jesus, my Love, I just want You.",
"3": "My heart is broken from my deepest need.
Don't ask me, angels, why I'm weeping.
Nothing but Jesus fills my inner being.
Oh! Where's my Love?",
"4": "Someone is standing right behind me.
It's just the gardener I can barely see.
Sir, if you carried Him away...
Oh! Where is He?",
"chorus": "Where is He my Jesus?
Where is He my Beloved?
Tell me where you have laid Him
And I'll carry Him away, I'll carry Him away.",
"5": "And then I heard a voice say, "Mary."
That sweetest voice that penetrated me.
It is the voice of my Beloved,
Jesus, my Love.",
"chorus": "I have found my Jesus!
I have found my Beloved!
I have found Whom my soul doth love,
Jesus, my love, I just love You!",
"6": "But Jesus told me not to touch Him yet.
He must ascend first to the Father
And to My Father and your Father
To My God and your God.",
"chorus": "Go and tell My brothers,
I ascend to the Father
To My Father and your Father,
And My God and your God, go tell My brothers."}
