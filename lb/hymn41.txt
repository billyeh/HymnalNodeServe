Count all things loss for Him.
Just gain Him, obtain Him; lay hold of Him.

Press on, pursue with this mind.
By any means each hour now redeem;
Stretch forth, lay hold of Him.",

Just love this precious Person.
Forgetting and leaving all other things,
Love Him with your whole being.",
"3": "Christ now is my center and reality,
My life for eternity.
All things are just dung compared to Him,
So love and just gain Him!"}
