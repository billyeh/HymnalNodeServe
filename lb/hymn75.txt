["1 Wherever you go, I will go,\nWherever you dwell, I will dwell;\nYour people will be my people,\nAnd your God will be my God.\nWherever you go, I will go,\nWherever you dwell, I will dwell;\nYour people will be my people,\nAnd your God will be my God.\nWherever you die, I will die;\nAnd there will I be buried.\nJehovah do to me, and more as well,\nIf anything but death parts me from you.\nJehovah do to me, and more as well,\nIf anything but death parts me from you."]
