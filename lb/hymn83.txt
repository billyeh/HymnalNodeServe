["1 All my life I searched for God\nFor joy and peace and happiness\nI prayed to idols on my knees\nBut \"my life summed up\" was hopelessness.\nMy hope was gone, I'm all alone.\nI'm facing death, darkness and gloom\nI had no joy or happiness\nBut fear with emptiness.", "2 My doctor and my children too\nThey tried their best to take me through\nBut none could heal my inward part\nSo let me die with a broken heart.\nMy hope was gone, I'm all alone\nI'm facing death, darkness and gloom\nI had no joy or happiness\nBut fear with emptiness.", "3 When death came knocking at my door\nI knew my life would be no more\nIt's then, Lord Jesus, You came in\nYour love and light came beaming in.\nMy hope was gone, I'm all alone\nI'm facing death, darkness and gloom\nThat's when You came with compassion\nJesus-Praise to Your name.", "4 Your blood cleansed me, Your love touched me\nI called Your name, Your life filled me\nAnd now I'm full of joy and peace\nYou're now my life and happiness.\nOh, rising Sun, in me You shined\nAnd now I know, Jesus You're mine\nYour shining face makes my heart sing\nWith healing in Your wings."]
