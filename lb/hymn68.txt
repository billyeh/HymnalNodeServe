{"1": "If there is no resurrection,
God would be God of the dead;
Christ Himself would not be living,
Ne'er have been raised from the dead.",
"chorus": "But there is a resurrection
Which is the vitality,
Both the life pulse and the lifeline
Within God's economy.",
"2": "If there is no resurrection,
Christ a Savior dead would be,
Not the One Who lives forever,
Who can save most utterly.",
"3": "If there is no resurrection,
There would be no living proof,
No proof that justification
Was accomplished by Christ's death.",
"4": "If there is no resurrection,
Life imparting would be stayed.
And so would regeneration
With renewing pass away.",
"5": "If there is no resurrection,
Then whatever would there be?
There would be no transformation,
Nor to Christ conformity.",
"6": "If there is no resurrection,
Where the members of the Christ?
There to Him would be no Body,
Which His fullness is in life.",
"7": "If there is no resurrection,
Then the church ne'er have been
Which is both to Christ His dear bride
And to God the one new man.",
"8": "If there is no resurrection,
Then would be God's economy,
With the voiding of His purpose,
In collapse fall totally."}
