{"1": "The divine dispensing starts with the Father.
He selected us 'ere the world began.
Predestinated to be His sons
Through His rich life dispensing.",
"2": "The Son accomplished the Father's purpose
By His redemption of fallen man
Through His own blood and according to
The riches of God's grace.",
"3": "The Spirit's sealing, the application
It works within us to permeate
And transform us with God's element
Unto our full redemption.",
"4": "The Spirit's pledging is just a foretaste
Of our divine inheritance.
It guarantees the full taste of God
As our eternal portion.",
"5": "We thank You, Father, Son, and Spirit
For all the blessings we have received.
We've given nothing, yet You give all.
How worthy of our praise!"}
