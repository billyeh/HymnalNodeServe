["1 God made me to be a man.\nI'm so glad I'm in His plan.\nHe chose me before the world began-\nI'm so happy that I'm a man.\nLook at the many items in the\nHeaven and earth we see;\nBillions of things that He has made;\nIt's all for you and me.\nI am a vessel made by God,\nPredestined as His son to be;\nHe chose me way back\nIn eternity.", "2 Satan came to corrupt man,\nAnd spoil God's wonderful plan.\nBut our God took on the flesh of man\nTo die for weak, sinful man.\nI never thought the\nMighty God became a man like me,\nTo put on flesh and blood\nAnd lay aside His glory.\nHe took up all our sins\nUpon His body to a tree\nTo redeem us from our sins,\nWe're now set free!", "3 Christ came in my deepest part-\nInto my spirit and heart.\nHe came in to never leave apart,\nNow we have a fresh, new start.\nChrist came into my spirit\nVery, very deep within.\nSimply by calling on His name\nI have experienced Him.\nChrist is my life and person now\nIn resurrection.\nOh, just call on Him,\nHe'll fill you to the brim!", "4 Fill, fill, fill! I'm full of Him.\nJoy, joy, joy! Overflowing.\nLove, love, love! Coming from Him within.\nOh, I have touched the King!"]
