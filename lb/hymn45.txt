["1 Abba, Father, hear our cry,\nMingled spirit deep within.", "chorus Abba, Father,\nAbba, Father.", "2 Thank You, Father, for sending Him;\nThe Spirit of Your Son Who cries within.", "3 Oh! How sweet is Abba's Name\nFrom our spirit through our heart.", "4 Every moment this mingled cry;\nTo Your Beloved we're joined thereby.", "5 Day by day, this cry so new;\nIn Your Son we come back to You.", "6 In Your bosom here we'll stay,\nIn Your Son and never stray."]
