{"1": "What about my sinful past?
And my conscience has no rest.
Deep within I feel the pain.
I'm condemned from all my guilty stains.",
"2": "O my life of misery,
In this world of vanity,
As I searched for happiness,
My reward I received just emptiness.",
"3": "God was far away from me,
Great and highest One is He.
Yet You took on humanity.
You came for me,
Hung on a tree,
Bled there to die for me.",
"chorus": "That's why I love Him.
That's why I treasure Him.
That's why I give my life and all to Him.
That's why I love Him.
That's why I treasure Him.
That's why I give my life and all to Him."}
