["1 What about my sinful past?\nAnd my conscience has no rest.\nDeep within I feel the pain.\nI'm condemned from all my guilty stains.", "2 O my life of misery,\nIn this world of vanity,\nAs I searched for happiness,\nMy reward I received just emptiness.", "3 God was far away from me,\nGreat and highest One is He.\nYet You took on humanity.\nYou came for me,\nHung on a tree,\nBled there to die for me.", "chorus That's why I love Him.\nThat's why I treasure Him.\nThat's why I give my life and all to Him.\nThat's why I love Him.\nThat's why I treasure Him.\nThat's why I give my life and all to Him."]
