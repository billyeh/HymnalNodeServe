{"1": "Just to be in You as You're in me.
Just abide in You, Lord, constantly.
Here I'm one with You, as You're with me.
Here we're joined as one, Lord, mutually.",
"chorus": "God's dispensing, His economy,
In His Trinity,
He's transfusing, and He's mingling
All He is to me.",
"2": "I am just a branch, and You're the vine.
As I dwell in You, everything is fine.
Here I'd like to be, Lord, all the time.
Here I'm Yours, dear Lord, and You are mine.",
"3": "I'm a branch that's been, Lord, grafted in.
I'm supplied in You in this life union.
Here Your riches, Lord, in this sweet life flow.
As I dwell in You, I will surely grow.",
"4": "As I dwell in You, and You in me,
Here I'm joined to You, Lord, practically.
As I stay with You, as You're with me,
We will mingle, Lord, subjectively.",
"5": "As I'm loving You and enjoying You, Lord,
You become in me the rhema word.
Here I'll pray in You as You pray in me.
You'll bear fruit in me, Lord, abundantly.",
"6": "As I dwell in You, Lord You're flowing through.
Lord, You're filling me, overflowing too.
Here we all are one and expressing You.
Here our joy is full as we dwell in You."}
