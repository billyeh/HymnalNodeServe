["1 We're the river-crossers, Hebrews is our name;\nCrossed the Euphrates, idols all are slain.\nEntered into Canaan, left the other side;\nSeeking a city, which shall e'er abide.\nWe are the Hebrews, that's our real name;\nWe've crossed the river, we are not the same.\nBuilding God's house that He may dwell on earth,\nBuilding God's house that He may dwell on earth.", "2 We were bound in Egypt, building for the foe;\nGod of the Hebrews said, \"Let My people go!\"\nWe have crossed the Red Sea, reached the other side;\nPharaoh, his army, perished in the tide.\nGod of the Hebrews, speak again today;\nGod of the Hebrews, lead us all the way.\nSave all Your people from this crooked age,\nSave all Your people from this crooked age.", "3 We're released, and now we build the house of God;\nHis tabernacle is our true abode.\nForty years of oldness left in Jordan's tide,\nFight we for Canaan on the kingdom side.\nSalvation's Captain sounds the trump of war;\nCity by city, take we more and more,\nTo gain His kingdom, enter into rest,\nTo gain His kingdom, enter into rest.", "4 What was once God-given soon a form became;\nThen John the Baptist did God's word proclaim-\nMake another crossing, God is going on;\nJudaism's over; listen to My Son!\nTurn from the prophets, turn unto the Son;\nHe's My Beloved, He and I are one;\nHis Word will save you to the uttermost,\nHis Word will save you to the uttermost.", "5 Now we're overcomers on the sea of glass;\nThis final crossing will forever last.\nSing the song of Moses, make the praise complete,\nLook! All our enemies beneath our feet.\nWe're overcomers, that's our real name.\nGod has His city; Satan gets the shame.\nGod is our portion for eternity,\nGod is our portion for eternity."]
