The holy, new Jerusalem;
It is God'sdwelling place with man
The spotless bride of Christ, the Lamb.",

Heirs of the promise God bestowed
Components of the city are
Together built for God's abode.",
"3": "Perfectly square the city lies
All sides are equal-length, width, height;
No measurement more long orshort
No part oblique, itstands upright.",

As clear asglass transparent is
Showing that God's transcendent life,
Itsquality and nature is.",

Thus man is through redemption shown,
Reborn and as a pearl transformed
Entering to a realm God's own.",

Are with twelve precious stonesadorned;
Through fire and pressure recomposed,
And with eternal value formed.",
"7": "The wall of jasper, crystal clear
God's glory by it fully shown;
His glorious light through it does shine
And He appears as jasper stone.",

Excluding all that is unclean;
Gold, pearls, and precious stones alone,
The holy city has within.",

Flows midst the street a living stream
And on its banks, on either side
The tree of life is thriving seen.",

Not just for food or water flows
But carries God's authority,
As it throughout the city goes.",
"13": "The street of purest gold therein,
God's nature as the way doth show;
A river in it flows for drink,
And fruits of life abundant grow.",
"14": "The number twelve means government
Perfection which eternal is;
God blent with man it also tells-
Three multiplied by four shows this.",
"15": "Darkness and death shall be no more
Sorrow and pain shall pass away
Old will be gone and all be new
God will abide with man for aye.",
"16": "The city has God's image full
It rules for Him, the sovereign King
Fulfilling His eternal plan
Complete content to Him to bring."}
