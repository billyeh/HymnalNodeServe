["1 While we pray and while we plead,\nWhile you see your soul's deep need,\nWhile our Father calls you home,\nWill you not to Jesus come?", "chorus Why not now? Why not now?\nWhy not come to Jesus now?\nWhy not now? Why not now?\nWhy not come to Jesus now?", "2 You have wandered far away;\nDo not risk another day;\nDo not turn from God thy face,\nBut today accept His grace.", "3 In the world you've failed to find\nAught of peace for troubled mind;\nCome to Christ, on Him believe,\nPeace and joy you shall receive.", "4 Come to Christ, confession make;\nCome to Christ, and pardon take;\nTrust in Him from day to day,\nHe will keep you all the way."]
