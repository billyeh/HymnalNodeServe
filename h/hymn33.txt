["1 Father, long before creation,\nThou hadst chosen us in love;\nAnd that love, so deep, so moving,\nDraws us close to Christ above,\nAnd will keep us, and will keep us,\nFirmly fixed in Christ alone,\nFirmly fixed in Christ alone.", "2 Though the world may change its fashion,\nYet our God is e'er the same;\nHis compassion and His cov'nant\nThrough all ages will remain.\nGod's own children, God's own children,\nMust forever praise His name,\nMust forever praise His name.", "3 God's compassion is my story,\nIs my boasting all the day;\nMercy free and never failing\nMoves my will, directs my way.\nGod so loved us, God so loved us,\nThat His only Son He gave,\nThat His only Son He gave.", "4 Loving Father, now before Thee\nWe will ever praise Thy love;\nAnd our song will sound unceasing\nTill we meet Thy Son above,\nGiving glory, giving glory,\nTo our God and to the Lamb,\nTo our God and to the Lamb."]
