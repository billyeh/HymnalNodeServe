{"1": "Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain,
Free to all-a healing stream,
Flows from Calv'ry's mountain.",
"chorus": "In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
From the cross my ransomed soul
Nothing then shall sever.",
"2": "Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.",
"3": "Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadow o'er me.",
"4": "Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I see my Savior's face,
Leave His presence never."}
