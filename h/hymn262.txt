["1 Come, Lord, as the Spirit come,\nLo! we stretch our hands to Thee;\nFrom the Father to the Son,\nLet us now Thy glory see.", "chorus Come, oh Lord, Great Spirit, come!\nLet the mighty deed be done!\nSatisfy our soul's desire,\nSee us waiting for the fire,\nWaiting, waiting,\nSee us waiting for the fire.", "2 On the altar now we lay\nSoul and body, mind and will;\nAll the evil passions slay,\nCome, and every corner fill.", "3 Now the sacrifice we make,\nThough as dear as a right eye,\nFor our blessed Savior's sake,\nWho for us did bleed and die.", "4 Now, by faith, the gift I claim,\nBought for me by blood divine:\nThrough the all-prevailing Name\nAll the promises are mine."]
