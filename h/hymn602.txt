{"1": "O how glorious! O how holy!
God is the eternal life!
Full, unlimited, and pow'rful
Pure, and merciful, and bright!
In this life are all His riches
All His nature, love and light.",
"2": "O how loving! O how gracious!
God Himself is life to man!
He in man hath made a spirit,
That He might fulfill His plan.
'Tis His heart's delight and longing,
E'er to be received by man.",
"3": "O what love and grace unbounded!
God as life to man doth flow!
He no more is hid in secret,
But Himself to man doth show
First in flesh and then as Spirit,
That His life all men may know.",
"4": "How approachable! How near us!
God in Christ our life to be!
Christ is God in flesh incarnate
Manifest for man to see.
Died and risen, now He enters,
Into man, his life to be.

"5": "O what wonder! As the Spirit,
God as life to man is shown!
'Tis His other transformation
He as Spirit thus is known;
Men convicting and inspiring
He within them makes His home.",
"6": "O how glorious! O how precious!
Thus the triune God to know!
First the Father in the Son came
Now the Son as Spirit flows.
When in man the Spirit enters,
God as life He doth bestow.",
"7": "How mysterious, yet how real!
God Himself now flows in me!
In my heart, with me in oneness
He has come my life to be.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I will praise unceasingly!"}
