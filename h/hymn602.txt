["1 O how glorious! O how holy!\nGod is the eternal life!\nFull, unlimited, and pow'rful\nPure, and merciful, and bright!\nIn this life are all His riches\nAll His nature, love and light.", "2 O how loving! O how gracious!\nGod Himself is life to man!\nHe in man hath made a spirit,\nThat He might fulfill His plan.\n'Tis His heart's delight and longing,\nE'er to be received by man.", "3 O what love and grace unbounded!\nGod as life to man doth flow!\nHe no more is hid in secret,\nBut Himself to man doth show\nFirst in flesh and then as Spirit,\nThat His life all men may know.", "4 How approachable! How near us!\nGod in Christ our life to be!\nChrist is God in flesh incarnate\nManifest for man to see.\nDied and risen, now He enters,\nInto man, his life to be.\n,", "5 O what wonder! As the Spirit,\nGod as life to man is shown!\n'Tis His other transformation\nHe as Spirit thus is known;\nMen convicting and inspiring\nHe within them makes His home.", "6 O how glorious! O how precious!\nThus the triune God to know!\nFirst the Father in the Son came\nNow the Son as Spirit flows.\nWhen in man the Spirit enters,\nGod as life He doth bestow.", "7 How mysterious, yet how real!\nGod Himself now flows in me!\nIn my heart, with me in oneness\nHe has come my life to be.\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nI will praise unceasingly!"]
