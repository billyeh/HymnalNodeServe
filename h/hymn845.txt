{"1": "Release my spirit! This is what I need:
O may my spirit with the saints' be knit;
No more in private ways Thyself to seek
But freed from self and for Thy building fit.",
"2": "Release my spirit! This is what I ask
That self-confined or closed I may not be;
How deep within myself I long have been
If Thou deliver not, I'll ne'er be free.",
"3": "Release my spirit! 'Tis for this I pray
That from myself I fully may come forth;
Thy Spirit then through me may freely flow
And Thou Thy presence fully may show forth.",
"4": "Release my spirit! This is what I want
That I from my seclusion may depart;
My private seeking poverty has brought
Now save from self, Thy wealth to me impart.
,",
"5": "Release my spirit! This is what I seek
That prisoned in my self no more I'll be;
By Satan's cunning cheated nevermore
But loosed from self to Thine infinity.",
"6": "Release my spirit! 'Tis for this I yearn
That self may bind my spirit nevermore;
With all the saints I'd mingle in Thy life
And all Thou art enjoy forevermore."}
