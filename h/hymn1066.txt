["1 Down at the cross where my Savior died,\nDown where for cleansing from sin I cried,\nThere to my sin was the blood applied;\nGlory to His name!", "chorus Glory to His name,\nGlory to His name;\nThere to my sin was the blood applied;\nGlory to His name!", "2 I am so wondrously saved from sin,\nJesus so sweetly abides within;\nThere at the cross where He took me in;\nGlory to His name.", "3 Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin,\nI am so glad I have entered in;\nThere Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;\nGlory to His name.", "4 Come to this fountain so rich and sweet;\nCast thy poor soul at the Savior's feet;\nPlunge in today, and be made complete;\nGlory to His name."]
