{"1": "In dealings with the Lord as life,
We need a proper heart
That of His riches, in His grace
We fully may take part.",
"2": "We need a heart in all things pure
With mind both sound and clear
To understand His mind and heart,
In trembling and in fear.",
"3": "We need a fervent, loving heart
A heart on fire with love
With an emotion filled with zeal,
For Him, all else above.",
"4": "We need a true, obedient heart
With a submissive will
A will made pliable, yet strong
God's purpose to fulfill.",
"5": "We need a heart condemning not
In all things right with God;
A heart which has a conscience purged,
And covered with the blood.",
"6": "Lord, grant us such a heart as this
Forever fixed on Thee
That of Thyself we may partake,
And Thy true fulness be."}
