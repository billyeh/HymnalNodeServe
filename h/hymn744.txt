["1 In dealings with the Lord as life,\nWe need a proper heart\nThat of His riches, in His grace\nWe fully may take part.", "2 We need a heart in all things pure\nWith mind both sound and clear\nTo understand His mind and heart,\nIn trembling and in fear.", "3 We need a fervent, loving heart\nA heart on fire with love\nWith an emotion filled with zeal,\nFor Him, all else above.", "4 We need a true, obedient heart\nWith a submissive will\nA will made pliable, yet strong\nGod's purpose to fulfill.", "5 We need a heart condemning not\nIn all things right with God;\nA heart which has a conscience purged,\nAnd covered with the blood.", "6 Lord, grant us such a heart as this\nForever fixed on Thee\nThat of Thyself we may partake,\nAnd Thy true fulness be."]
