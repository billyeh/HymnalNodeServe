["1 Earthen vessel I was made\nChrist in me the treasure laid;\nHis container I must be\nAs the content He in me.", "2 In His image I was made\nFit that Christ should all pervade;\nThus the vessel God did form,\nWith the content uniform.", "3 In my spirit He remains\nWith His power He sustains;\nAs the Spirit one with me\nHe is my reality.", "4 Moving in me day by day\nMingling with me all the way\nAll my steps He regulates\nEvery part He saturates.", "5 Him expressing from within\nMaking Him to others seen\nI transparent have to be,\nThat He may be shown thru me.", "6 Transformation is my need\nTo be broken more indeed\nThat the clay may change in form\nTo the treasure to conform."]
