{"1": "Earthen vessel I was made
Christ in me the treasure laid;
His container I must be
As the content He in me.",
"2": "In His image I was made
Fit that Christ should all pervade;
Thus the vessel God did form,
With the content uniform.",
"3": "In my spirit He remains
With His power He sustains;
As the Spirit one with me
He is my reality.",
"4": "Moving in me day by day
Mingling with me all the way
All my steps He regulates
Every part He saturates.",
"5": "Him expressing from within
Making Him to others seen
I transparent have to be,
That He may be shown thru me.",
"6": "Transformation is my need
To be broken more indeed
That the clay may change in form
To the treasure to conform."}
