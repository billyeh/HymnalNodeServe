{"1": "O glorious Christ, Savior mine
Thou art truly radiance divine;
God infinite, in eternity
Yet man in time, finite to be.",
"chorus": "Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great
Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
God mingled with humanity,
Lives in me my all to be.",
"2": "The fulness of God dwells in Thee;
Thou dost manifest God's glory;
In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;
As Spirit, oneness with me sought.",
"3": "All things of the Father are Thine;
All Thou art in Spirit is mine;
The Spirit makes Thee real to me
That Thou experienced might be.",
"4": "The Spirit of life causes Thee,
By Thy Word to transfer to me.
Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received
Thy life in me is thus conceived.",
"5": "In spirit while gazing on Thee
As a glass reflecting Thy glory
Like to Thyself transformed I'll be
That Thou might be expressed thru me.",
"6": "In no other way could we be,
Sanctified and share Thy vict'ry;
Thus only spiritual we'll be,
And touch the life of glory.",
"7": "Thy Spirit will me saturate,
Every part will God permeate
Deliv'ring me from the old man
With all saints building for His plan."}
