["1 When Christ of old with healing pow'r\nWent forth through all the suffering land,\nHis word so oft was wont to be,\n\"Stretch forth thy hand, stretch forth thy hand!\"\nAnd though the palsied arm might shrink\nAnd tremble at the strange command,\nThe healing touch was only felt\nWhile stretching forth the withered hand.", "chorus O suffering one, stretch forth your hand,\nUpon His promise take your stand.\nAt His command stretch forth your hand,\nAnd Christ shall make you whole.", "2 That changeless Christ is still as near\nAnd just as kind and strong to save;\nHe came to lift our fallen race\nFrom sin and sickness and the grave.\nAs in the days of Galilee,\nDisease still flees at His command;\nBut ere His touch your frame can feel,\nYou, too, must still stretch forth your hand.", "3 What though you feel so weak and faint?\nHe can your will with strength endue,\nNew faith and courage breathe within\nAnd work in you to will and do.\nReach out to meet His quickening touch;\nTake up your bed, arise and stand;\nAnd pressing through to meet your Lord,\nStretch forth your hand, stretch forth your hand."]
