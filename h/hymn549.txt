{"1": "Enter the veil and go without the camp
Taste heaven's sweetness, thus the earth forsake;
If by the Holiest I am satisfied
How can I of earth's vanities partake?",
"2": "Enter the veil and go without the camp
By heaven's presence will the earth depart;
If heaven's glory doth my spirit charm
How can earth's happiness possess my heart?",
"3": "Enter the veil, behold the glorious Christ
Go out the camp to Jesus, let Him lead;
If throne and crown my spirit here enthrall
Manger and cross cannot my steps impede.",
"4": "Enter the veil for resurrection pow'r
Go out the camp to bear the cross and woe
If I His radiant face in heaven see
His footsteps I will follow here below.",
"5": "Enter the veil, on heaven's fatness feast
Without the camp, in hardship persevere;
Though earthly trials sorely pain my heart
Heaven's communion doth my spirit cheer.",
"6": "Enter the veil, Christ's riches there enjoy
Without the camp, the needs of men supply;
The life of heaven living out thru me,
The souls of earth will bless and satisfy.",
"7": "Enter the veil till it exists no more
Go out the camp till all the camps are gone;
Until the heavens and the earth unite
Till God and man together dwell in one."}
