["1 Pressed out of measure, pressed beyond all length;\nPressed so intensely, seeming beyond strength;\nPressed in the body, pressed within the soul,\nPressed in the mind till darksome surges roll.", "chorus God is my hope and God is my joy;\nHe is the resurrection life I enjoy.", "2 Pressure by foes, and pressure from our friends;\nPressure on pressure, till life nearly ends;\nPressed into knowing none to help but God,\nPressed into loving both the staff and rod.", "3 Pressed into liberty where nothing clings,\nPressed into faith for hard and hopeless things;\nPressed into life, a life in Christ the Lord,\nPressed into life, the life of Christ outpoured."]
