{"1": "If our hearts would be established;
If in spirit we would be;
If we would be overcomers;
Follow Jesus constantly.
Follow Jesus in the spirit;
Be the overcomers true;
Follow Jesus every moment-
Jesus, help us follow You.",
"2": "If we would be built together;
If related we would be;
To be fitly framed together;
Follow brothers constantly.
Follow brothers for the building;
Never independent be;
Follow brothers, be in order,
Functioning in harmony.",
"3": "If we're for the Lord's recovery;
If the earth the Lord's would be;
If we would bring in the kingdom;
Follow churches constantly.
Follow all the local churches;
Thus, the kingdom we will see.
Follow in the churches' flowing
For the Lord's recovery.",
"4": "We would all be better followers,
Taking in with joy the Word;
It enables us to follow
Brothers, churches, and our Lord.
Follow Jesus; follow brothers;
Follow churches in the flow;
By the Word of God amening
We can all attain this goal."}
