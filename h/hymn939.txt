["1 O day of resurrection,\nO day of joy and light,\nO seal of our redemption,\nMost beautiful, most bright:\nOn thee the high and lowly,\nBending before the throne,\nSing \"Holy, holy, holy,\"\nTo the great Three in One.", "2 On thee at the creation\nThe light first had its birth;\nOn thee, for our salvation,\nChrist rose from depths of earth;\nOn thee, our Lord, victorious,\nThe Spirit sent from heaven;\nAnd thus on thee, most glorious,\nA triple light was given.", "3 Today on weary nations\nThe heavenly manna falls!\nTo holy convocations\nThe silver trumpet calls,\nWhere gospel light is glowing\nWith pure and radiant beams,\nAnd living water flowing\nWith soul-refreshing streams.", "4 New graces ever gaining\nFrom this of days the best,\nWe reach the rest remaining\nFor people who are blest;\nTo Holy Ghost be praises,\nTo Father and to Son;\nThe Church her voice upraises\nTo Thee, blest Three in One."]
