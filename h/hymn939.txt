{"1": "O day of resurrection,
O day of joy and light,
O seal of our redemption,
Most beautiful, most bright:
On thee the high and lowly,
Bending before the throne,
Sing "Holy, holy, holy,"
To the great Three in One.",
"2": "On thee at the creation
The light first had its birth;
On thee, for our salvation,
Christ rose from depths of earth;
On thee, our Lord, victorious,
The Spirit sent from heaven;
And thus on thee, most glorious,
A triple light was given.",
"3": "Today on weary nations
The heavenly manna falls!
To holy convocations
The silver trumpet calls,
Where gospel light is glowing
With pure and radiant beams,
And living water flowing
With soul-refreshing streams.",
"4": "New graces ever gaining
From this of days the best,
We reach the rest remaining
For people who are blest;
To Holy Ghost be praises,
To Father and to Son;
The Church her voice upraises
To Thee, blest Three in One."}
