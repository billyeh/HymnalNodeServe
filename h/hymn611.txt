{"1": "God's glorious substance Spirit is
His essence, holy and divine;
To contact God and Him enjoy
His Spirit I must touch with mine.",
"2": "The spirit is the innermost
The part of man most deep and real;
If he would contact God in life
'Tis with the spirit he must deal.",
"3": "The worship which the Father seeks,
Is in the spirit's strength alone;
His Spirit into man's would come
That His and man's may thus be one.",
"4": "When Spirit unto spirit calls,
The two commingle and are one;
Man's spirit is the Spirit's home
The Spirit doth man's life become.",
"5": "Man's spirit must God's Spirit touch,
If in God's fulness he would live;
'Tis only with the spirit thus,
That he to God may worship give.",
"6": "In ministry and fellowship,
Man to the spirit we must bring;
All ministry should turn to prayer
Spirit to spirit answering.",
"7": "In spirit we must pray and serve
In spirit touch the life divine
In spirit grow, in spirit build
That Christ thru us may fully shine.",
"8": "Lord, to the spirit I would turn,
And learn to truly contact Thee;
Thy Spirit thus will flow with mine,
And overflow eternally."}
