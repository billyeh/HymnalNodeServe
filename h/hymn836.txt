{"1": "Christ is made the sure foundation,
Christ the head and cornerstone,
Chosen of the Lord and precious,
Binding all the Church in one;
Holy Zion's help forever,
And her confidence alone.",
"2": "Founded on the Lord victorious,
Christ the everlasting Rock,
Stands the Church in heav'nly places,
Dreading not the storm or shock;
Built with life divine she ever
Stands against attack and mock.",
"3": "Though the gates of hades frustrate,
Yet the Church still stands for God,
Overcoming evil spirits
By her Lord's victorious blood;
And at Christ's return in triumph
All her foes will then be trod."}
