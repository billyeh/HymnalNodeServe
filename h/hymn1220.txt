{"1": "Remove the veils, Lord, from my heart;
True revelation grant to me;
A vision clear, O Lord, impart
Of Thy recovery.",
"2": "By revelation I perceive
The power that raised Christ from the dead;
When I by faith this power receive,
I to the church am led.",
"3": "Thy mighty power has set me free
From all the world's distracting things;
An entrance to the local church
This mighty power brings.",
"4": "Once in the local church, I need
To take Thee as my person, Lord;
My outward man each day recede,
My heart is for the Lord.",
"5": "I take Thee as my person, Lord;
I have been crucified with Thee.
My inner man has been restored;
I'm now indwelt by Thee.",
"6": "When all Thy members self forsake,
Thy glorious Body, Lord, is known;
When of Thy Person we partake,
The one new man is shown.",

In every local church expressed;
Thy Body is a corporate man,
One Person manifest.
