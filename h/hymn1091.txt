["1 We praise Thee, O Lord Jesus, Thou didst come,\nThe way into God's presence to reveal.\nWe worship Thee that Thou didst leave Thy throne,\nTo come as our High Priest with sin to deal.\nLord Jesus, Thou hast offered Thine own blood,\nAnd settled once for all our peace with God.", "2 Thy blood has now been sprinkled on the throne\nIn full redemption for Thy people's sin.\nThe sweetness of the love that Thou hast shown\nHas ris'n to fill the holiest place within.\nAnd by the blood once offered in that place\nGod flows to us in mercy and in grace.", "3 Yet, Lord, Thou camest not just to atone,\nBut Thou didst come and bear our sins away.\nWe, with a conscience purged, approach the throne,\nFor all our sins were laid on Thee that day.\nThou, separated from the Father's face,\nDidst pay the awful price for us in grace.", "4 The way into God's presence thus is cleared,\nFor ransomed sinners who have heard Thy call.\nThou, Lord, hast taken all that we had feared\nWhen Thou didst shed Thy blood and give Thine all;\nOur heart in grateful praise to Thee we bind,\nAnd now our life in Thee alone we find."]
