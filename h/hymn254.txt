{"1": "O Lord of life, breathe on us now.
And move within us while we pray:
The spring of our new life art Thou,
The very light of our new day.",
"2": "O strangely art Thou with us, Lord,
Neither in height nor depth to seek;
In nearness shall Thy voice be heard:
Spirit to spirit Thou dost speak.",
"3": "Thou art our Advocate on high:
He is our Advocate within;
O plead the truth, and make reply
To every argument of sin.",
"4": "But ah, this faithless heart of mine!
The way I know, I know my guide;
Forgive me, O my Friend divine,
That I so often turn aside.",
"5": "Be with me when no other friend
The myst'ry of my heart can share:
And be Thou known, when fears transcend.
By Thy best name of Comforter."}
