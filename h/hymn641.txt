["1 Art thou hung'ring for the fulness\nOf the blessing Christ doth give?\nLonging now to learn the secret\nOf the life He bids thee live?\nIn His word thine answer standeth,\n\"Christ who is our Life\" it saith;\nOpen now thy heart, and trust Him,\nThere to dwell, henceforth, by faith.", "2 Christ, the Lord's Anointed, reigning\nO'er the life He died to win,\nDaily shall reveal more fully\nHis great power, without, within.\nWhat thou never could'st accomplish\nShall His Spirit work through thee,\nWhile thy soul this witness beareth,\n'Tis not I, but Christ in me.", "3 In Him dwelleth all God's fulness,\nIn Him thou art made complete;\nRise, and claim thy heavenly birthright,\nKneeling at thy Father's feet.\nHe will never disappoint thee,\nPraise Him that the gift is thine;\nThen go forth to live each moment\nOn sufficiency divine.", "4 Lord, I come, and simply resting\nOn Thy faithful, changeless word,\nI believe the blood doth cleanse me,\nAnd that Christ is crowned Lord.\nGrant henceforth a ceaseless outflow\nOf Thy life and love through me;\nReaching those who sit in darkness,\nWinning priceless souls to Thee."]
