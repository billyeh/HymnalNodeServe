{"1": "O what a miracle, my Lord
That I'm in Thee and Thou in me
That Thou and I are really one;
O what a wondrous mystery!",
"2": "For me Thy body Thou didst give
That I may ever share in Thee;
For me Thy precious blood was shed
That from my sins I might be free.",
"3": "By resurrection Thou didst change,
Thy form and as the Spirit come;
Thou wouldst that I be filled with Thee,
That all Thy riches mine become.",
"4": "Now as the symbols we behold
Thy loving self we see anew;
We thank Thee for Thy heart's desire,
As all Thy travail we review.",
"5": "We eat the bread and drink the wine
And to Thy sweetness we are led;
In spirit each receiving Thee
Our spirits with Thyself are fed.",
"6": "We long to eat and drink e'en more
To take Thyself in spirit thus
Till Thou shalt all our being fill,
And true remembrance have from us."}
