{"1": "In Chicago* land we must take our stand
To meet Thy demand in these days.
Lord, Thy purpose great doth our heart elate,
As Thy name we now exalt and praise.",
"chorus": "Purpose, purpose, Thine eternal purpose;
Show forth Christ and shame the enemy;
Purpose, purpose, Thine eternal purpose
In Chicago realized must be.",
"2": "All things we forsake for Thy Body's sake,
Soul-life for us break in Thy way.
We've been wrecked by Thee, since Thy plan we see;
On Thine altar everything we lay.",
"chorus": "Break us! Break us! For Thy purpose break us.
Grant our spirits, Lord, a full release;
Break us! Break us! For Thy purpose break us;
In Chicago, Jesus must increase.",
"3": "With this vision clear and Thy presence dear,
Our hearts have no fear-forth we go.
Lord, Thy heart's desire has set us afire;
To Thy chosen ones this vision show:",
"chorus": "Lampstand, lampstand, see the golden lampstand,
Shining with the glory of the Lord.
Lampstand, lampstand, see the golden lampstand,
In Chicago, Jesus Christ is Lord.
