{"1": "The Spirit of life is within us today
Who's likened to water our thirst to allay;
Of Him we may drink and be filled thus with Him
Until as a river He flows from within.",
"2": "The Spirit of pow'r comes upon us today
Who's likened to clothing ourselves to array;
In Him we are baptized, with Him we are dressed
For service equipping with power possessed.",
"3": "The Spirit of life is as breath glorious
As spirit of life it is breathed into us;
The Spirit of pow'r doth the wind typify
Which bloweth upon us with pow'r from on high.",
"4": "Into His disciples the risen Lord breathed
The Spirit of life thus to them He bequeathed;
Th' ascended Lord poured at the Pentecost hour,
Upon His disciples the Spirit of pow'r.",
"5": "The Spirit of life is within as the life
The Spirit of power is giv'n for this life;
As blowing of wind- brings the fresh air to breathe
The Spirit of power to life doth bequeath.",
"6": "These are not two spirits apart and afar
But of the one Spirit the two functions are
To clothe us with God and to fill us within
That we may be thoroughly mingled with Him.",
"7": "Lord, fill with Thy Spirit of life every part
That we may grow up in Thy life as Thou art;
And clothe us without with Thy Spirit of pow'r,
Thy will to fulfill in Thy service each hour."}
