Thy wisdom with Thy grace;
As wisdom Thou mad'st Him to us
In Him Thy way we trace.",

Thy way of grace is He;
In Him, Thy Wisdom, we have all
That glory be to Thee.",

Have we been justified;
In Him, who is our holiness
We're being sanctified.",
"4": "Redemption too He is to us
According to Thy plan
That we may fully be redeemed,
To be a perfect man.",

In Thine economy;
For Him we offer praise to Thee,
With all humility.",
"6": "Thy wisdom we have seen in Him
So rich and so profound;
Yet richer, deeper, in Thy way
By us will it be found."}
