["1 There is a healing branch that grows\nWhere every bitter Marah flows;\nThis is our health-renewing tree.\n\"I am the Lord that healeth thee.\"", "2 There is an old appointed way\nFor those who hearken and obey;\nAbove the gate these words we see:\n\"I am the Lord that healeth thee.\"", "3 There is an ordinance that has stood\nSince Israel crossed the parted flood;\nIt stands today for you and me-\n\"I am the Lord that healeth thee.\"", "4 There is a great Physician still\nWhose hand has all its ancient skill;\nAt His command our pains will flee-\n\"I am the Lord that healeth thee.\""]
