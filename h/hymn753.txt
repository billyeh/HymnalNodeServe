{"1": "There is a healing branch that grows
Where every bitter Marah flows;
This is our health-renewing tree.
"I am the Lord that healeth thee."",
"2": "There is an old appointed way
For those who hearken and obey;
Above the gate these words we see:
"I am the Lord that healeth thee."",
"3": "There is an ordinance that has stood
Since Israel crossed the parted flood;
It stands today for you and me-
"I am the Lord that healeth thee."",
"4": "There is a great Physician still
Whose hand has all its ancient skill;
At His command our pains will flee-
"I am the Lord that healeth thee.""}
