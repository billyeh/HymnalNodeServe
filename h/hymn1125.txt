God's righteous nature was satisfied;
There to my sin was the blood applied,
Glory to His name!",

Glory to His name;
There to my sin was the blood applied,
Glory to His name!",

Fully enjoy our redemption free;
This we'll enjoy for eternity,
Glory to His name!",
"3": "Oh, precious fact, when my Savior died,
Not only sin's debt was satisfied;
Life's flowing fountain was opened wide!
Glory to His name!",
"chorus": "Glory to His name,
Glory to His name;
Life's flowing fountain was opened wide,
Glory to His name!",
"4": "Now both redemption and life we share,
Cleansed in His blood, we're abiding there
Drinking the water of life fore'er;
Glory to His name!"}
