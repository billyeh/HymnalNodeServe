["1 To those who fear Jehovah's name\nHow sweet the word the prophet brings:\nThe Sun of Righteousness shall rise\nWith healing in His wings.", "2 It is to those that fear His name\nHis healing power the Savior brings;\nOh, let us hide with contrite hearts\nBeneath His healing wings.", "3 He is the Sun of Righteousness;\nAnd while to sin our being clings\nWe cannot know His healing touch\nOr rest beneath His wings.", "4 It is His wings that heal our pains\nAnd soothe the serpent's poisoned stings;\nClose to His bosom we must press\nTo feel His healing wings.", "5 Beneath those healing wings I rest,\nWhile all my heart with rapture sings:\nThe Sun of Righteousness has risen\nWith healing in His wings."]
