{"1": "To those who fear Jehovah's name
How sweet the word the prophet brings:
The Sun of Righteousness shall rise
With healing in His wings.",
"2": "It is to those that fear His name
His healing power the Savior brings;
Oh, let us hide with contrite hearts
Beneath His healing wings.",
"3": "He is the Sun of Righteousness;
And while to sin our being clings
We cannot know His healing touch
Or rest beneath His wings.",
"4": "It is His wings that heal our pains
And soothe the serpent's poisoned stings;
Close to His bosom we must press
To feel His healing wings.",
"5": "Beneath those healing wings I rest,
While all my heart with rapture sings:
The Sun of Righteousness has risen
With healing in His wings."}
