["1 On His Father's throne is seated\nChrist the Lord, the living One!\nAll His toil on earth completed,\nAll His work for sinners done.\nIn the glory, in the glory,\nSee Him-God's eternal Son!", "2 Every knee shall bow before Him,\nEvery tongue confess His name,\nRansomed myriads shall adore Him,\nWho endured the sinner's shame!\nFrom the glory, from the glory,\nGod doth now His worth proclaim.", "3 Man, the cross to Him awarded;\nMan, the Savior crucified;\nThis world's judgment stands recorded.\nGod's own justice satisfied!\nBy the glory, by the glory,\nChrist was claimed on earth who died.", "4 Son of Man, His incarnation\nOpened first the tale of grace;\nSon of Man, in new creation\nLeader of a chosen race!\nWell may glory, well may glory,\nGive to Him the honored place!"]
