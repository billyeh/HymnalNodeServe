["1 God, we praise Thee for Thy mercy\n'Tis so great and so profound!\nIn our weakness and our failures;\nWith its greatness it abounds.\nWe adore Thee! we adore Thee!\nWith such mercy we've been crowned!", "2 How we marvel at this mercy,\nSo far-reaching and so vast!\nIt has reached us, e'en the sinners\nAnd will ever hold us fast.\nFrom this mercy, from this mercy\nWhat can cause us to be cast?", "3 For Thy mercy we are grateful\n'Tis so rich, so plenteous!\nThru Thy mercy in redemption\nThou hast richly favored us.\nIf without this, if without this\nHow could we be favored thus?", "4 Oh, Thy mercy, so inspiring!\nGentle, tender, dear and sweet!\nWith Thy patience and Thy kindness\nUs in all our need it meets.\nIt we treasure, it we treasure\nNothing can with it compete.", "5 Father, we enjoy Thy mercy\nEver fresh and ever new;\nEvery morning shed upon us\nIt refreshes as the dew.\nHow we taste it! how we taste it!\nGiving Thee the praises due.", "6 We can never cease to praise Thee\nAs Thy mercy e'er endures;\nAll Thy grace and all Thy favor\nEver for us it secures.\nTrusting in it, trusting in it\nThy sure mercy us assures."]
