["1 O soul-inspiring story-\nGod's majesty and grace\nIn lustrous strokes of glory\nDeep-carved in Jesus' face!\nHearts rapt in contemplation\nOf Godhead's Image bright,\nBreak forth in adoration,\nIn wonder and delight!", "2 There Manhood, all perfection,\nAnd Godhead-fulness shine;\nGod's love and Man's affection,\nThe human, the divine;\nA life, a death, transcendent,\nRevealing God as love:\nHere, lowly Man, dependent-\nGod over all, above!", "3 Unsullied blaze of glory!\nO ever-radiant Face!\nThy rich, unfathomed story\nTransfigures us in grace!\nMade like Thee, soon, completely,\nWith love-lit eyes we'll scan\nGod's face unveiled so sweetly\nIn Thine, Thou Son of man!"]
