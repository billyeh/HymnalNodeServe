["1 Marvel not that Christ in glory\nAll my inmost heart hath won;\nNot a star to cheer my darkness,\nBut a light beyond the sun.\nAll below lies dark and shadowed,\nNothing here to claim my heart,\nSave the lonely track of sorrow\nWhere of old He walked apart.", "2 Others in the earthly sunshine\nWearily may journey on,\nI have seen a light from heaven\nPast the brightness of the sun-\nLight that knows no cloud, no waning,\nLight wherein I see His face,\nAll His love's uncounted treasures,\nAll the riches of His grace:", "3 All the wonders of His glory,\nDeeper wonders of His love-\nHow for me He won, He keepeth\nThat high standing all above;\nNot a glimpse-the veil uplifted-\nBut within the veil to dwell,\nGazing on His face forever,\nHearing words unspeakable.", "4 I have seen the face of Jesus-\nTell me not of aught beside;\nI have heard the voice of Jesus-\nAll my soul is satisfied.\nIn the radiance of the glory\nFirst I saw His blessed face,\nAnd forever shall that glory\nBe my home, my dwelling-place."]
