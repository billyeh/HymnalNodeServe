{"1": "The work is Thine, O Christ our Lord,
The cause for which we stand;
And being Thine, 'twill overcome
Its foes on every hand.
Yet grains of wheat, before they grow,
Are buried in the earth below;
All that is old doth perish there
To form a life both new and fair:
So too are we from self and sin made free.",
"2": "Through suff'ring Thou, O Christ, didst go
Unto Thy throne above,
And leadest now the selfsame way
Those true in faith and love;
So lead us, then, though suff'rings wait,
To share Thy kingdom's heav'nly state;
Thy death has broken Satan's might,
And leads the faithful to the light;
Eternal light, from darkness into light.",
"3": "Thou hast, O Savior, led the way
Through agony and death;
O give, we pray, yet more and more
Thy Spirit's living breath!
Send messengers o'er land and sea
To bring Thy children all to Thee;
Thy name can save, Thy name makes free;
We consecrate ourselves to Thee
As servants true, as warriors brave and true."}
