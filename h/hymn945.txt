{"1": "The Son of God has come to sow,
Himself, the seed of life, in man
That thru Himself God's Kingdom grow,
And thus fulfill th' eternal plan.",
"2": "He was the only grain of wheat,
Whence many grains have been produced,
To be the Kingdom's children meet
Thru whom God's reign is introduced.",
"3": "But Satan, enemy of God
Sowed many tares among the wheat
The Kingdom's children to confuse
And awful damage to create.",
"4": "'Tis by this subtle work of his
The mixing of the tares with wheat
The Kingdom in appearance is,
Abnormal and grotesquely great.",
"5": "The Kingdom should as mustard be
A little herb, yet good for food
But it has changed into a "tree,
A system of great magnitude.",
"6": "Instead of being good for food
A lodge of "birds" it has become:
'Tis now a place where evil men,
And evil spirits make their home.",
"7": "A great religion of the world,
Its outward form to us reveals.
Including pagan, evil things
As leaven mingled with the meal.",
"8": "A system of the world as such
It thus has changed in outward form;
By evil things which it imbibes
Corruption inwardly doth swarm.",
"9": "But something hidden God doth seek
As "pearl" and "treasure in the field"
As such the Lord would us transform,
That pearl and treasure be revealed.",
"10": "'Tis hidden from vast Christendom,
And from the Kingdom's great facade
Yet in its full reality,
'Tis transformed like to Christ and God.",
"11": "Lord, separate us from the "tares,
And save us from the monstrous "tree"
From all the "leaven" purge us now,
That we may purely be of Thee.",
"12": "May Thou in life transform our souls,
That we as precious stones may be
Meet for Thy house to build and in,
Thy Kingdom's full reality."}
