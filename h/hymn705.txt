{"1": "In some way or other the Lord will provide.
It may not be my way, it may not be thy way;
And yet in His own way, "the Lord will provide."",
"chorus": "Then we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide;
Yes, we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide.",
"2": "At some time or other the Lord will provide:
It may not be my time, it may not be thy time;
And yet in His own time, "the Lord will provide."",
"3": "Despond then no longer; the Lord will provide:
And this be the token-no word He hath spoken
Was ever yet broken: ""The Lord will provide."",
"4": "March on then right boldly: "the sea shall divide;
The pathway made glorious, with shoutings victorious,
We'll join in the chorus, "The Lord will provide.""}
