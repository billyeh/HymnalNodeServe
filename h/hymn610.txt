{"1": "God's Spirit His transmission is
In Him God enters into us;
It is in Him that God in Christ,
May be experienced by us.",
"2": "God as the Father is the source
And God the Son doth Him express;
God as the Spirit enters us
That God as all we may possess.",
"3": "The Father, who is veiled in light
The Son to man hath fully shown;
The Spirit then transmitteth Him,
That He may inwardly be known.",
"4": "The Son within the Father is
And now the Spirit is the Son.
The Spirit, Son, and Father God,
Are now in us and with us one.",
"5": "God as the Father in the Son,
Has been embodied and expressed
And God the Spirit is the Son's,
Reality to be possessed.",
"6": "May God the Father's love to us,
In God the Son as grace be known
Thru God the Spirit's fellowship
That God our portion we may own."}
