["1 In the secret of His presence\nHow my soul delights to hide!\nOh, how precious are the lessons\nWhich I learn at Jesus' side!\nEarthly cares can never vex me,\nNeither trials lay me low;\nFor when Satan comes to tempt me,\nTo the secret place I go.", "2 When my soul is faint and thirsty,\n'Neath the shadow of His wing\nThere is cool and pleasant shelter,\nAnd a fresh and crystal spring;\nAnd my Savior rests beside me,\nAs we hold communion sweet;\nIf I tried, I could not utter\nWhat He says when thus we meet.", "3 Only this I know: \"I tell Him\nAll my doubts and griefs and fears;\nOh, how patiently He listens!\nAnd my drooping soul He cheers;\nDo you think He ne'er reproves me?\nWhat a false friend He would be,\nIf He never, never told me\nOf the sins which He must see.", "4 Would you like to know that sweetness\nOf the secret of the Lord?\nGo and hide beneath His shadow;\nThis shall then be your reward;\nAnd whene'er you leave the silence\nOf that happy meeting-place,\nBy the Spirit bear the image\nOf the Master in your face.\nnote: \"(Repeat the last line of each stanza)"]
