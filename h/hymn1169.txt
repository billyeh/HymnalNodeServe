{"1": "Our worship in reality
Is typified in Moses' law:
With Canaan's produce, rich and sweet,
All Israel came and worshipped God.",
"2": "'Tis thus that we must come today
To worship in reality:
When we bring Christ as produce sweet
God fully satisfied will be.",
"3": "The worship that God so desired
Was not with manna sent from heav'n,
But from their labor on the land
The people's gifts to God were giv'n.",
"4": "Thus, what God so desires today.
Are not the miracles so grand,
But daily, normal life in Christ,
As worship, produce of the land.",
"5": "The manna came from God alone;
The produce, from man's work on Him.
So all our worship now must come
From mingling with the Lord within.",
"6": "As day by day we live in Christ,
And take Him as our everything,
The produce of the land comes forth
And worship true to God we'll bring.",
"7": "The manna, Lord, no more we'll seek,
But Christ in all we will apply;
Then we will have some produce sweet,
Thine own dear heart to satisfy."}
