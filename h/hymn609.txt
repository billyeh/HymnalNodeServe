{"1": "I praise Thee for Thy mystery
That I may truly contact Thee;
In unapproachable light Thou wast,
But now as Spirit nigh to me.",
"2": "The Father, Son, and Spirit, Thou
The triune God, my life fore'er;
In me Thou art the full supply,
That I Thy holy nature share.",
"3": "The triune God the Spirit is
And comes as breath and wind to me;
'Tis thus I may experience,
The Godhead's wondrous mystery.",
"4": "All that the Father is and has,
In His beloved Son doth rest
And all the riches of the Son,
Are by the Spirit now possessed.",
"5": "The Spirit doth descend on me,
And to my spirit enters in
That He, the Father in the Son
My blessed portion be within.",
"6": "The Father is the fountainhead
The Son expression gives to Him;
The Spirit is His very flow
As my reality within.",
"7": "The Father in the Son has come,
That God to man Himself may show;
The Son as Spirit enters me,
That God I inwardly may know.",
"8": "The Father purposed that the Son,
Should be the first in everything;
The Son the Father takes as Head,
And over all His headship brings.",
"9": "The Spirit perfectly desires,
That Christ, the Son, be glorified
And He reveals Him unto me
That He be fully testified.",
"10": "Thy final form the Spirit is
Our worship to receive within;
If I Thy riches would enjoy
In spirit I must contact Him.",
"11": "If I in spirit worship Thee
In spirit live, in spirit pray
The Holy Spirit I will touch,
And Thee enjoy in every way."}
