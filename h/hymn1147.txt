{"1": "Christ is our manna true,
Our bread of life indeed;
He's our supply of nourishment,
As on Him now we feed.",
"2": "From Egypt Israel fled
Into a desert land;
Egyptian food they left behind,
And wandering began.",
"3": "One day, the manna fell,
Oh, what a wondrous feat;
This was the bread the Lord had giv'n
For Israel to eat.",
"4": "Unique this manna is,
It comes with morning dew;
The visit of God's grace it is,
Forever fresh and new.",
"5": "God is majestic, high,
And greater than us all;
But that we may partake of Him,
In Christ, He's fine and small.",
"6": "Though ground, or beat, or baked,
He's so available;
As bread and cakes and wafers fresh,
We eat Him to the full.",
"7": "Manna shows Him to be
The germ of life, the seed;
'Tis God Himself sown into us,
The source of all we need.",
"8": "Between the morning dew
And cold of winter snow,
This manna too is frost which kills
Things negative below.",
"9": "How pure and white and clean;
In type our Christ we see;
As we digest His element,
He washes inwardly.",
"10": "Manna with honey is;
Two lives this type does show;
One for the Lord's redemptive work,
And one His life to grow.",
"11": "By eating more of Christ
We'll be the less opaque;
We'll then appear as bdellium,
Transparent us to make.",
"12": "Lord, as we're eating here
And in the manna see
The riches of this glorious Christ,
We're filled with praise to Thee."}
