{"1": "Jesus, Thy life is mine,
Dwell evermore in me;
And let me see
That nothing can untwine
Thy life from mine.",
"2": "Thy life in me be shown,
Lord, I would henceforth seek
To think and speak
Thy thoughts, Thy words alone,
No more my own.",
"3": "Thy love, Thy joy, Thy peace,
Continuously impart
Unto my heart,
Fresh springs that never cease,
But still increase.",
"4": "The blest reality
Of resurrection power,
Thy Church's dower,
Life more abundantly,
Lord, give to me.",
"5": "Thy fullest gift, O Lord,
Now at Thy word I claim,
Through Thy dear Name,
And touch the rapturous chord
Of praise forth-poured.",
"6": "Jesus, my life is Thine,
And evermore shall be
Hidden in Thee,
For nothing can untwine
Thy life from mine."}
