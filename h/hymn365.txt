["1 Jesus, Thy life is mine,\nDwell evermore in me;\nAnd let me see\nThat nothing can untwine\nThy life from mine.", "2 Thy life in me be shown,\nLord, I would henceforth seek\nTo think and speak\nThy thoughts, Thy words alone,\nNo more my own.", "3 Thy love, Thy joy, Thy peace,\nContinuously impart\nUnto my heart,\nFresh springs that never cease,\nBut still increase.", "4 The blest reality\nOf resurrection power,\nThy Church's dower,\nLife more abundantly,\nLord, give to me.", "5 Thy fullest gift, O Lord,\nNow at Thy word I claim,\nThrough Thy dear Name,\nAnd touch the rapturous chord\nOf praise forth-poured.", "6 Jesus, my life is Thine,\nAnd evermore shall be\nHidden in Thee,\nFor nothing can untwine\nThy life from mine."]
