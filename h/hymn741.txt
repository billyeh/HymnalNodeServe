["1 God ordained us unto sonship\nEre creation's work was done\nTo conform us by His Spirit,\nTo the image of His Son;\nThat His only dear Begotten,\nMight become the firstborn One\nAnd by Him with many brethren,\nHis expression full be won.", "2 By divine regeneration,\nWe the sons of God became\nBut we must mature to fullness\nThus the birthright to obtain.\nBorn and fully grown to manhood\nGod's adoption we may share;\nBy the measure of full stature\nWe God's sonship will declare.", "3 All our spirit, soul and body,\nUnto Christ conformed must be;\nThis will be accomplished fully,\nWhen our glorious Lord we see.\nBy our body's full redemption,\nShall adoption be complete;\nBy the final transformation,\nAll God's purpose we shall meet.", "4 By that final transformation\nWe'll be fully sanctified;\nGod will bring us into glory\nWith His Son identified.\nAll creation is expecting,\nSons of God revealed to be\nThat they might be freed from bondage,\nInto glorious liberty."]
