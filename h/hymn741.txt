{"1": "God ordained us unto sonship
Ere creation's work was done
To conform us by His Spirit,
To the image of His Son;
That His only dear Begotten,
Might become the firstborn One
And by Him with many brethren,
His expression full be won.",
"2": "By divine regeneration,
We the sons of God became
But we must mature to fullness
Thus the birthright to obtain.
Born and fully grown to manhood
God's adoption we may share;
By the measure of full stature
We God's sonship will declare.",
"3": "All our spirit, soul and body,
Unto Christ conformed must be;
This will be accomplished fully,
When our glorious Lord we see.
By our body's full redemption,
Shall adoption be complete;
By the final transformation,
All God's purpose we shall meet.",
"4": "By that final transformation
We'll be fully sanctified;
God will bring us into glory
With His Son identified.
All creation is expecting,
Sons of God revealed to be
That they might be freed from bondage,
Into glorious liberty."}
