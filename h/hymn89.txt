{"1": "What grace, O Lord, and beauty shone
Around Thy steps below!
What patient love was seen in all
Thy life and death of woe!",
"2": "Forever on Thy burdened heart
A weight of sorrow hung,
Yet no ungentle, murm'ring word
Escaped Thy silent tongue.",
"3": "Thy foes did hate, despise, revile,
Thy friends unfaithful prove;
Unwearied in forgiveness still,
Thy heart could only love!"}
