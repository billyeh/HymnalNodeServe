["1 What grace, O Lord, and beauty shone\nAround Thy steps below!\nWhat patient love was seen in all\nThy life and death of woe!", "2 Forever on Thy burdened heart\nA weight of sorrow hung,\nYet no ungentle, murm'ring word\nEscaped Thy silent tongue.", "3 Thy foes did hate, despise, revile,\nThy friends unfaithful prove;\nUnwearied in forgiveness still,\nThy heart could only love!"]
