["1 I have found, I have found the way\nWhich leads to heav'nly rest;\nI have found, I have found the peace\nWhich filled my Savior's breast.\nO friends in the desert past,\nCome, join in prayer and praise;\nE'en now He waits our cry,\nThe Savior who saves always.", "2 He hath taken our sins away,\nWhen on Calv'ry's cross He bled;\nThe disease of our soul He heals\nBy His Spirit freely shed;\nThough Satan hath pierced us deep,\nAnd great the grace each prays;\nThe more we prove His might,\nThe Savior who saves always.", "3 Long, alas! in the gloom I fought,\n'Mid strife of wind and waves;\nJesus seemed only this to me:\nA Savior who sometimes saves.\nBut sweet are the light and calm\nThat fill my happy days,\nSince now I fully trust\nThe Savior who saves always.", "4 O my Sun and my Shield art Thou\nLead on where Thou hast trod;\nMy Salvation, my Joy, my Song,\nMy Brother, and yet my God.\nWhate'er then my life betide,\nI now can trust and praise;\nEach moment Thou wilt save,\nO Savior, who sav'st always."]
