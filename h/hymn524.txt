{"1": "I have found, I have found the way
Which leads to heav'nly rest;
I have found, I have found the peace
Which filled my Savior's breast.
O friends in the desert past,
Come, join in prayer and praise;
E'en now He waits our cry,
The Savior who saves always.",
"2": "He hath taken our sins away,
When on Calv'ry's cross He bled;
The disease of our soul He heals
By His Spirit freely shed;
Though Satan hath pierced us deep,
And great the grace each prays;
The more we prove His might,
The Savior who saves always.",
"3": "Long, alas! in the gloom I fought,
'Mid strife of wind and waves;
Jesus seemed only this to me:
A Savior who sometimes saves.
But sweet are the light and calm
That fill my happy days,
Since now I fully trust
The Savior who saves always.",
"4": "O my Sun and my Shield art Thou
Lead on where Thou hast trod;
My Salvation, my Joy, my Song,
My Brother, and yet my God.
Whate'er then my life betide,
I now can trust and praise;
Each moment Thou wilt save,
O Savior, who sav'st always."}
