{"1": "In nothing be anxious; the Lord is at hand.
In peace and in vict'ry triumphantly stand;
Let nothing affright thee and nothing dismay,
For Jesus is coming! It may be today.",
"2": "In nothing be anxious; on Him roll thy care.
Thy sins were laid on Him, thy sorrows He'll bear;
Care free and triumphant press on, still to prove
The strength of His arm and the balm of His love.",
"3": "In nothing be anxious; should Jesus delay
His strength will be thine till the end of the day.
His arm thou canst lean on; His Spirit will cheer;
Then wherefore be anxious, press on without fear."}
