["1 In nothing be anxious; the Lord is at hand.\nIn peace and in vict'ry triumphantly stand;\nLet nothing affright thee and nothing dismay,\nFor Jesus is coming! It may be today.", "2 In nothing be anxious; on Him roll thy care.\nThy sins were laid on Him, thy sorrows He'll bear;\nCare free and triumphant press on, still to prove\nThe strength of His arm and the balm of His love.", "3 In nothing be anxious; should Jesus delay\nHis strength will be thine till the end of the day.\nHis arm thou canst lean on; His Spirit will cheer;\nThen wherefore be anxious, press on without fear."]
