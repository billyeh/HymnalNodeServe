{"1": "Lord, the Spirit, Truth divine,
Dawn upon this heart of mine;
Word of God, and inward light,
Wake my spirit, clear my sight.",
"2": "Lord, the Spirit, Love divine,
Glow within this heart of mine,
Kindle every high desire,
Perish self in Thy pure fire.",
"3": "Lord, the Spirit, Power divine,
Fill and nerve this will of mine;
By Thee may I strongly live,
Bravely bear, and nobly strive.",
"4": "Lord, the Spirit, Peace divine,
Still this restless heart of mine,
Speak to calm this tossing sea,
Stayed in Thy tranquillity.",
"5": "Lord, the Spirit, Joy divine,
Gladden Thou this heart of mine;
In the desert ways I'll sing:
Spring, O Well, forever spring!
