{"1": "God's Spirit is of Christ today
The Spirit of reality
He dwells in me with Christ as life,
To make this Christ so real to me.",
"2": "As Christ is God's embodiment
Expressing God as life divine;
So is the Spirit unto Christ
Revealing Him in life sublime.",
"3": "The fulness of the Father God,
In Christ the Son dwells bodily;
And all the riches of the Son,
Are Spirit, our reality.",
"4": "Oh in the Son the Father is
And now the Spirit is the Son;
The Father with the Son is joined
The Spirit with the Son is one.",
"5": "'Tis when the Spirit strengthens us,
And Christ His home makes in our hearts
The Father's fulness with His love,
Will fill us in our inward parts.",
"6": "In Christ, the Father we possess
Receiving Him for all our need;
In Spirit we experience Christ,
As life and everything indeed.",
"7": "With Thy divine reality
Lord, fill us by Thy Spirit now
That we may all be full of Thee
And all Thy riches thus avow."}
