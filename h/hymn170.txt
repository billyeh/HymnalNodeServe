{"1": "Lord, Thou art the lovely Bridegroom
God appointed, dear to us;
Thy dear self is so attractive
To our heart so beauteous!",
"2": "Dear Beloved, we admire Thee
Who can tell Thy preciousness;
All Thy love we deeply treasure,
And Thine untold loveliness.",
"3": "Thou art fairer than the fairest
Thou art sweeter than the sweet;
Thou art meek and Thou art gracious
None can e'er with Thee compete.",
"4": "Full of myrrh are all Thy garments
And Thy lips are filled with grace;
In the savor of Thy suffering
We in love Thyself embrace.",
"5": "It is with the oil of gladness,
Thy God hath anointed Thee;
From the palaces of ivory,
Praise shall ever rise to Thee.",
"6": "God hath blessed Thee, Lord, forever
Thou hast won the victory;
Now we see Thee throned in glory,
With Thy pow'r and majesty.",
"7": "Thou art the desire of nations
All Thy worth they'll ever prove;
Thou, the chiefest of ten thousand
Ever worthy of our love."}
