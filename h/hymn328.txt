["1 Complete in Thee! no work of mine\nMay take, dear Lord, the place of Thine;\nThy blood hath pardon bought for me,\nAnd I am now complete in Thee.", "chorus Yea, justified! O blessed thought!\nAnd sanctified! Salvation wrought!\nThy blood hath pardon bought for me,\nAnd glorified, I too, shall be!", "2 Complete in Thee-no more shall sin,\nThy grace hath conquered, reign within;\nThy voice shall bid the tempter flee,\nAnd I shall stand complete in Thee.", "3 Complete in Thee-each want supplied,\nAnd no good thing to me denied;\nSince Thou my portion, Lord, wilt be,\nI ask no more, complete in Thee.", "4 Dear Savior! when before Thy bar\nAll tribes and tongues assembled are,\nAmong Thy chosen will I be,\nAt Thy right hand-complete in Thee."]
