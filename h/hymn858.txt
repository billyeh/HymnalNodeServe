{"1": "All praise to our redeeming Lord,
Who joins us by His grace,
And bids us, each to each restored,
Together seek His face,
Together seek His face.",
"2": "He bids us build each other up;
And, gathered into one,
To our high calling's glorious hope,
We hand in hand go on,
We hand in hand go on.",
"3": "The gift which He on one bestows,
We all delight to prove;
The grace through every vessel flows,
In purest streams of love,
In purest streams of love.",
"4": "We all partake the joy of one;
The common peace we feel;
A peace to worldly minds unknown,
A joy unspeakable,
A joy unspeakable.",
"5": "And if our fellowship below
In Christ yet be so sweet,
What height of rapture shall we know,
When round His throne we meet,
When round His throne we meet!"}
