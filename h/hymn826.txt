{"1": "I saw great throngs-each was a brother dear,
Linked with each other in one Body here;
Each in close union with the living Head,
The witness-folk, by Jesus' Spirit led.",
"2": "At every time, in every clime I found
Those, not with words to Christ, but Spirit bound.
He strengthens them with might each day, each hour;
Through them true works divine are wrought in power.",
"3": "This is the Church the Spirit hath begot,
Elect from every people, Christ their lot.
They follow where His shepherd-staff doth lead;
The members of this host are blessed indeed.",
"4": "And when on earth they meet His death to show,
To Him their vows of love they oft renew.
Some little flock will gather there or here;
Christ, Head of all, to every soul most near.",
"5": "This is the temple which our Lord approves,
The Church which truly honors Him and loves,
Whose sacrifice is on the altar bound;
She soon in glory will His throne surround."}
