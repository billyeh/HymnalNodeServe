Off'ring Him as service true.",

"2": "As the Israelites did offer,
From the surplus of their land
Thus some produce reaped of Jesus,
Must be in our serving hand.",
"3": "We on Christ, as land, must labor
Harvest Him for all our fare;
Tasting Him to overflowing
Christ with others we may share.",
"4": "Holding Christ, as members growing
Each his function must observe;
Christ receiving, Christ partaking
To His Body Christ we serve.",
"5": "Fellowship and testimony
Ministry and worship too
In all helps and ministrations,
Christ is all our service true."}
