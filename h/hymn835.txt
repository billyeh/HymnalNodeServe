["1 On Christ, salvation rests secure;\nThe Rock of Ages must endure;\nNor can that faith be overthrown\nWhich rests upon the \"Living Stone.\"", "2 No other hope shall intervene;\nTo Him we look, on Him we lean;\nOther foundations we disown,\nAnd build on Christ, the \"Living Stone.\"", "3 In Him it is ordained to raise\nA temple to Jehovah's praise,\nComposed of all His saints, who own\nNo Savior but the \"Living Stone.\"", "4 View the vast building, see it rise:\nThe work how great! the plan how wise!\nO wondrous fabric! pow'r unknown:\nThat rests it on the \"Living Stone.\"", "5 But most adore His precious name:\nHis glory and His grace proclaim!\nFor us, the lost, condemned, undone,\nHe gave Himself, the \"Living Stone.\""]
