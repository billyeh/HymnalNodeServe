["1 Lord Jesus Christ, we would remember Thee,\nAs, on the table, we the emblems see;\nThy holy body shadowed in the bread,\nThy precious blood is in the cup portrayed.", "2 Lord, we adore Thee for Thy matchless grace,\nThat Thou, for us, didst take the servant's place;\nFrom Godhead's glory to the shameful tree,\nFrom wealth, so vast, to abject poverty!", "3 O Lamb of God, we join to bless Thy name,\nThat Thou, on Calv'ry, bore our sin and shame\nAnd, by Thy death, didst put our guilt away,\nTriumphant rose, our night to turn to day.", "4 We see Thee now, at God's right hand enthroned,\nVested with honor and with glory crowned;\nBlessed Redeemer, Savior, Lord, to Thee\nBe all the glory, pow'r and majesty!"]
