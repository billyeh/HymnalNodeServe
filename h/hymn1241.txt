{"1": "God's life and building can be seen
Within the Song of Songs;
He shows by types His seeking ones,
The Bride for whom Christ longs!",
"2": "She, as a team of horses shows
A love, so swift and strong!
But this is love that's natural-
It pulls the world along!",
"3": "As time goes by, her concepts change,
With dove's eyes she can see
That naught can with her love compare-
There's none so dear as He!",
"4": "A lily she is now to Him
(For still the Lord draws on),
Her faith is not in earthly toil,
But in the wondrous Son.",
"5": "She's next a dove who hides herself
Within the cloven rock;
Now in her Lord's ascended life
Is love which knows no shock!",
"6": "Of smoke, a pillar she's become,
And now, as wand'ring ends,
Her wills to His will are subdued,
What fragrance sweet ascends!",
"7": "Behold His couch . . . (O, can this be?)
E'en midst the fearsome night . . .
She now affords her Lord such rest,
The foe is put to flight!",
"8": "A vessel to contain the King!
(This type is full of worth.)
A palanquin He's made Himself
For His move on the earth!",
"9": "Of wood this vessel is composed:
Christ's ris'n humanity.
Its silver pillars for support
And floor of gold we see!",
"10": "The seat of purple signifies
Christ is of kings the King.
To Him, as fittings for within,
Their love His dear ones bring!",
"11": "The day will come-('tis surely soon)
And glad will be Thy heart-
What boast and glory to Thyself;
Thy crown, Thy counterpart!",
"12": "A garden fair, enclosed is she
With spices, fragrant, sweet.
She now brings forth materials
The building to complete!",
"13": "A city pleasant, comely, too;
No greater building, this!
So beautiful, yet to the foe
A conq'ring army 'tis!",
"14": "As we eat Jesus, praise the Lord,
The transformation's done,
Until at last, the work's complete-
Christ and His Bride are one!"}
