["1 An uplifted gospel have we,\nOne we're not ashamed to proclaim.\nOur gospel's the highest of all,\nFor it is God's goal and God's aim.\nNo longer so lowly and poor,\nWe've found that we're God's holy sons.\nNo more will we preach as before;\nNow each man on earth can be won.", "2 Our Brother's inherited all\nGod made Him to rule His affairs\nAppointed-this office He fills\nAnd shares it with us, His joint-heirs.\nElected before earth was formed,\nWe've found that we are qualified\nTo share all His glory and worth.\nHow could men but for Christ decide?", "3 Yes, we're holy brothers with Christ,\nNo higher could any man be.\nThis highest of all gospels is;\nThis gospel each human must see.\nPartakers of this heavenly call,\nCould any this gospel reject?\nWith Christ sitting far above all-\nThis highest of all gospels yet!"]
