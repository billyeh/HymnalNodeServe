{"1": "O God of burning altar fire,
O God of love's consuming flame,
Make pure the flame of our desire
To win the lost to seek Thy Name.",
"2": "There is no coldness, Lord, in Thee,
Oh, keep us kindled lest we bring
To our dear Lord of Calvary,
Dead ashes for our offering.",
"3": "Dead ashes, husk of corn for wheat
Lord of our consecration vow,
We gather round Thy wounded feet,
We see the thorn about Thy brow.",
"4": "Oh, by Thy cross and passion, Lord,
Grant us this plea, this sovereign plea,
Save us from choosing peace for sword,
And give us souls to give to Thee."}
