["1 Abba, Father! we adore Thee,\nHumbly now our homage pay;\n'Tis Thy children's bliss to know Thee,\nNone but children \"Abba\" say.\nThis high honor we inherit,\nThy free gift through Jesus' blood;\nGod the Spirit, with our spirit,\nWitnesseth we're sons of God.", "2 Thine own purpose gave us being,\nWhen in Christ, in that vast plan,\nThou in Christ didst choose Thy people\nE'en before the world began.\nOh, what love Thou, Father, bore us!\nOh, how precious in Thy sight!\nWhen to Thine own Son Thou gav'st us,\nTo Thy Son, Thy soul's delight.", "3 Though our nature's fall in Adam\nShut us wholly out from God,\nThine eternal counsel brought us\nNearer still, through Jesus' blood;\nFor in Him we found redemption,\nGrace and glory in Thy Son;\nO the height and depth of mercy!\nChrist and His redeemed are one.", "4 Hence, through all the changing seasons,\nTrouble, sickness, sorrow, woe,\nNothing changeth Thine affections,\nLove divine shall bring us through;\nSoon shall all Thy blood-bought children\nRound the throne their anthems raise,\nAnd, in songs of rich salvation,\nShout to Thine eternal praise."]
