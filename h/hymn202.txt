{"1": "O Lord, Thou art the Alpha,
And the Omega too;
Thou art the First, before all
And art the Last so true.
Thou art the sole Beginning
The only End of all;
In Thee all is included
Creations great and small.",
"2": "Lord, since Thou art the Alpha
All things commenced of Thee;
And as the sole Omega
All things will end in Thee;
As God's full Alphabet, Lord
All is of Thee composed;
Since Thou art all the letters
All is in Thee enclosed.",
"3": "As First of all the creatures
Thou art the Head of all;
As Last in God's creation
Thou art the close of all.
As First of all the creatures
All things by Thee consist;
As Last in God's creation
All things for Thee subsist.",
"4": "Since Thou art the Beginning
Thou hast preceded all;
And since Thou art the Ending
Thou wilt inherit all.
Thou, the unique Beginning
Didst all originate;
Thou, as the only Ending
Wilt all things terminate.",
"5": "O Lord, how we adore Thee,
And treasure Thee with love;
As Alpha and Omega
Thou art all things above.
We praise Thee, the Beginning
The very First we call;
We worship Thee, the Ending
The only Last of all."}
