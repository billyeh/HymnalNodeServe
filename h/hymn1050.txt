["1 Out of my bondage, sorrow, and night,\nJesus, I come! Jesus, I come!\nInto Thy freedom, gladness, and light,\nJesus, I come to Thee!\nOut of my sickness into Thy health,\nOut of my want and into Thy wealth,\nOut of my sin and into Thyself,\nJesus, I come to Thee!", "2 Out of my shameful failure and loss,\nJesus, I come! Jesus, I come!\nInto the glorious gain of Thy cross,\nJesus, I come to Thee!\nOut of earth's sorrows into Thy balm,\nOut of life's storm and into Thy calm,\nOut of distress to jubilant psalm,\nJesus, I come to Thee!", "3 Out of unrest and arrogant pride,\nJesus, I come! Jesus, I come!\nInto Thy blessed will to abide,\nJesus, I come to Thee!\nOut of myself to dwell in Thy love,\nOut of despair into raptures above,\nUpward for aye on wings like a dove,\nJesus, I come to Thee!", "4 Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,\nJesus, I come! Jesus, I come!\nInto the joy and pleasure, Thine own,\nJesus, I come to Thee!\nOut of the depths of ruin untold,\nInto the flock Thy love doth enfold,\nEver Thy glorious face to behold,\nJesus, I come to Thee!"]
