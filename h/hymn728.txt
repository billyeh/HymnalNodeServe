{"1": "I have been through the valley of sorrow and weeping,
The valley of trouble and pain;
But the "God of all comfort," the "God of all comfort,"
Was with me to hold and sustain.",
"2": "As the earth needs the clouds and the rain with the sunshine,
Our souls need both sorrow and joy,
So He places us oft in the fire of affliction
The dross from the gold to destroy.",
"3": "When He leads thru the valleys of trouble and sorrow,
His mercy and love there we trace;
For the trials and sorrows He sends us in wisdom
Are part of His lessons in grace.",
"4": "Yet how often we shrink from the purging and pruning,
Forgetting the Husbandman knows
That the deeper and closer the cutting and paring,
The richer the cluster that grows.",
"5": "O how well does He know that afflictions are needed;
He has a wise purpose in view,
And within the dark valley He whispers to comfort,
"Hereafter thou'lt know what I do."",
"6": "As we travel the pathway thru life's shadowed valleys,
Fresh springs of His love ever rise;
And we learn that our troubles, our sorrows and losses,
Are blessings just sent in disguise.",
"7": "So we'll follow Him faithfully where'er He leadeth,
The pathway be dreary or bright;
For we've proved that our God is the "God of all comfort,
The God who gives songs in the night."}
