["1 Objective and subjective Christ is to us\nIn heaven He's pleading objectively thus;\nSubjectively now in His members He lives,\nAnd inwardly to them His being He gives.", "2 In heaven He sits at the right hand of God\nWhere as the High Priest He presented His blood;\nOur Advocate, bearing our burdens above\nOur Surety, He careth for us in His love.", "3 He now is the Spirit, our spirit within;\nHe's there as our life, all things bringing with Him;\nHe's there as our strength and our grace every hour\nOur Paraclete in us, sustaining with pow'r.", "4 In heaven for us He's the glorified man\nThe Forerunner entered, fulfilling God's plan;\nMan into God bringing and making him one,\nWith God in the heav'nlies, in Him as the Son.", "5 In us all the fulness of God dwells in Him;\nAs Spirit He brings God Himself thus within\nRevealing and making God real unto us\nGod one with us building in life glorious.", "6 The Savior ascended in heaven now dwells\nAnd soon He's returning for us His Word tells;\nDeliverer indwelling, He now in us lives\nAnd soon will transfigure, His glory to give.", "7 The day soon is coming when heaven and earth,\nWill mingle in one in that city of worth;\nObjective and subjective will in that day,\nBe mingled within us in glory for aye."]
