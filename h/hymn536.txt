{"1": "Objective and subjective Christ is to us
In heaven He's pleading objectively thus;
Subjectively now in His members He lives,
And inwardly to them His being He gives.",
"2": "In heaven He sits at the right hand of God
Where as the High Priest He presented His blood;
Our Advocate, bearing our burdens above
Our Surety, He careth for us in His love.",
"3": "He now is the Spirit, our spirit within;
He's there as our life, all things bringing with Him;
He's there as our strength and our grace every hour
Our Paraclete in us, sustaining with pow'r.",
"4": "In heaven for us He's the glorified man
The Forerunner entered, fulfilling God's plan;
Man into God bringing and making him one,
With God in the heav'nlies, in Him as the Son.",
"5": "In us all the fulness of God dwells in Him;
As Spirit He brings God Himself thus within
Revealing and making God real unto us
God one with us building in life glorious.",
"6": "The Savior ascended in heaven now dwells
And soon He's returning for us His Word tells;
Deliverer indwelling, He now in us lives
And soon will transfigure, His glory to give.",
"7": "The day soon is coming when heaven and earth,
Will mingle in one in that city of worth;
Objective and subjective will in that day,
Be mingled within us in glory for aye."}
