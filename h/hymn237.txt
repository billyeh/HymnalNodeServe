["1 Amazing words!-He 'gave Himself for me,'\nFor me-rebellious, sinful, guilty me.\nFor me the Savior bore the cross and shame;\nRejoice, my soul, and bless His sacred name.", "2 For me He left His glorious throne above,\nFor me revealed His Father's wondrous love,\nFor me He tabernacled here below,\nFor me He drank the bitter cup of woe.", "3 For me He was reviled, despised, betrayed;\nFor me was scourged, condemned and crucified;\nFor me He suffered on th' accursed tree,\nFor me-lost, wretched, vile, unworthy me.", "4 For me in agony He groaned and died,\nFor me God's righteous law He satisfied,\nFor me His precious blood He shed to save,\nFor me He rose triumphant from the grave."]
