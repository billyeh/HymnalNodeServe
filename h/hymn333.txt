["1 I know not why God's wondrous grace\nTo me He hath made known,\nNor why, unworthy, Christ in love\nRedeemed me for His own.", "chorus But \"I know Whom I have believed\nAnd am persuaded that He is able\nTo keep that which I've committed\nUnto Him against that day.\"", "2 I know not how this saving faith\nTo me He did impart,\nNor how believing in His word\nWrought peace within my heart.", "3 I know not how the Spirit moves,\nConvincing men of sin,\nRevealing Jesus through the Word,\nCreating faith in Him.", "4 I know not what of good or ill\nMay be reserved for me,\nOf weary ways or golden days,\nBefore His face I see.", "5 I know not when my Lord may come,\nAt night or noon-day fair,\nNor if I'll walk the vale with Him,\nOr \"meet Him in the air.\""]
