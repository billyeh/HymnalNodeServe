{"1": "To Thee, dear Lord, O Christ of God,
We sing, we ever sing;
For Thou hast shed Thy precious blood
Our cup of joy to bring.
Thy mighty arm the fight hath fought,
Thou art enthroned above;
We into glory will be brought
Thy wondrous grace to prove.",
"2": "To Thee, dear Lord, O Christ of God,
We sing, we ever sing;
Thou hast invaded death's abode
And robbed him of his sting.
The house of dust enthralls no more,
For Thou, the strong to save,
Thyself doth guard that silent door,
Great Keeper of the grave.",
"3": "To Thee, dear Lord, O Christ of God,
We sing, we ever sing;
For Thou hast crushed beneath Thy rod
The world's proud rebel king,
And plunged in Thine imperial strength
To gulfs of darkness down,
And brought Thy trophy up at length
The foiled usurper's crown.",
"4": "To Thee, dear Lord, O Christ of God,
We sing, we ever sing;
Thou hast redeemed us with Thy blood
From every evil thing.
God's saving strength Thine arm upbore,
The arm that set us free;
Glory, O Christ, for evermore
Be to Thy God and Thee."}
