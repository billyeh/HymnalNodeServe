{"1": "There is a certain sense of life,
With life of every kind;
And in th' eternal life in us,
It is a sense divine.",
"2": "The higher any life may be
The better is its sense;
The life divine the highest is,
And has the highest sense.",
"3": "It is the sense of life in us
It is the sense of God;
'Tis in our spirit made alive
And more than sense of good.",
"4": "It is the inner sense in us
The inmost consciousness
Discerning matters inwardly
God's will to thus express.",
"5": "'Tis by this sense that God we know
The sense of inner life;
'Tis pow'rful and spontaneous
And not of any strife.",
"6": "The greater is our growth in life
The keener is this sense;
The more we walk and act in life
The more it is intense.",
"7": "The sense of life when exercised,
Will make our spirit bold
And by this inner sense of God,
True fellowship we hold."}
