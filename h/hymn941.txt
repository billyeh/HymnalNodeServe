{"1": "God's kingdom is God's reigning
His glory to maintain;
It is His sovereign ruling
His order to sustain.
He exercises fully,
His own authority,
Within His kingdom ever,
And to eternity.",
"2": "Upon the throne, the center,
Of government divine
God reigns, and with His purpose,
Brings everything in line.
God's headship and His lordship,
He only can maintain,
As King within His kingdom
O'er everything to reign.",
"3": "By reigning in His kingdom,
God worketh all His will
And under His dominion,
His purpose doth fulfill.
'Tis only in God's kingdom,
His blessing we may know;
'Tis from His throne almighty,
The stream of life doth flow.",
"4": "Submitted to God's ruling
All virtue thus will win;
Rebellion to His Headship,
Is but the root of sin.
The evil aim of Satan-
God's throne to overthrow;
Our aim and goal is ever,
His rule to fully know.",
"5": "Within God's sovereign kingdom,
His Christ is magnified;
When Christ in life is reigning
The Father's glorified.
When God is in dominion
All things are truly blessed;
When Christ for God is reigning.
God's glory is expressed.",
"6": "In fulness of the seasons,
God's Christ will head up all.
Then all will own His reigning,
And worship, great and small.
Such reign in life and glory,
The Church e'en now foretastes,
And to His rule submitting,
Unto His kingdom hastes."}
