I claim the gracious promise mine,
And add to His my countersign,

Dost undertake for me.",

Through Him who gave His life for me,

My spirit's spotless, heavenly dress,
I take the Lord, my righteousness,
"I take"-"He undertakes."",

I take the power of Pentecost,
To fill me to the uttermost,
"I take"-"He undertakes."",

I take my healing through His Name,
And all His risen life I claim,
"I take"-"He undertakes."",

I praise Him that my prayer is heard,
And claim my answer from the Lord,
"I take"-"He undertakes.""}
