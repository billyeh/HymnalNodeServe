["1 'Tis my happiness below\nNot to live without the cross;\nBut the Savior's pow'r to know\nSanctifying every loss.", "2 Trials must and will befall;\nBut with humble faith to see\nLove inscribed upon them all-\nThis is happiness to me.", "3 Did I meet no trials here,\nNo chastisement by the way,\nMight I not with reason fear\nI should prove a castaway?", "4 Trials make the promise sweet;\nTrials give new life to prayer;\nBring me to my Savior's feet,\nLay me low and keep me there."]
