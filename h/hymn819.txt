{"1": "As the body is the fulness,
To express our life
So to Christ the Church, His Body
Doth express His life.",
"2": "E'en as Eve is part of Adam,
Taken out of him
So the Church is Christ's own increase,
With Himself within.",
"3": "As from out the buried kernel,
Many grains are formed
As the grains together blended,
To a loaf are formed;",
"4": "So the Church, of many Christians
Christ doth multiply
Him expressing as one Body
God to glorify.",
"5": "As the branches of the grapevine,
Are its outward spread
With it one, abiding, bearing,
Clusters in its stead;",
"6": "So the Church's many members,
Christ's enlargement are
One with Him in life and living
Spreading Him afar.",
"7": "Fulness, increase, duplication
His expression full
Growth and spread, continuation
Surplus plentiful",
"8": "Is the Church to Christ, and thereby,
God in Christ may be,
Glorified thru His redeemed ones,
To eternity.",
"9": "Thus the Church and Christ together
God's great mystery
Is the mingling of the Godhead,
With humanity."}
