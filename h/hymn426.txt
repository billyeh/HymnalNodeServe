{"1": "Remove my covering, Lord
That I may see Thy light
And be deceived no more
But all things see aright.",
"chorus": "Oh, may Thy living light, Lord
Scatter all my night, Lord
And everything make bright, Lord
For this I pray to Thee.",
"2": "I hardly know myself;
Deceived so much by pride
I often think I'm right,
And am self-satisfied.",
"3": "I know Thee even less;
In doctrine, shallowly;
True revelation lack,
Of Thy reality.",
"4": "As for Thy life within
In darkness I mistake-
If spirit or the flesh
One for the other take.",
"5": "As for Thy way, O Lord
I often am not clear;
I toward seclusion tend,
And from the pathway veer.",
"6": "As for Thy will for me
I do not know it well;
I substitute my own,
And often would rebel.",
"7": "As for the church, I need,
Thy revelation more
The Body-life to know
Thy wisdom to explore.",
"8": "I long to be unveiled
In everything made clear
No more to be deceived,
Or to my pride adhere."}
