["1 Alas! and did my Savior bleed?\nAnd did my Sov'reign die,\nWould He devote that sacred head\nFor such a worm as I?", "2 Was it for sins that I had done\nHe groaned upon the tree?\nAmazing pity! grace unknown!\nAnd love beyond degree!", "3 Well might the sun in darkness hide,\nAnd shut his glories in,\nWhen the incarnate Maker died\nFor man, His creature's sin.", "4 Thus might I hide my blushing face\nWhile His dear cross appears\nDissolve my heart in thankfulness,\nAnd melt mine eyes to tears.", "5 But drops of grief can ne'er repay\nThe debt of love I owe;\nHere Lord, I give myself away:\n'Tis all that I can do."]
