["1 Have you felt the Father's love?\nStill there's more to follow;\nAnd His mercy have you proved?\nStill there's more to follow.\nOh, the love the Father shows,\nStill there's more to follow;\nFreely He His love bestows,\nStill there's more to follow.", "chorus More and more, more and more,\nAlways more to follow;\nOh, His matchless, boundless love,\nStill there's more to follow.", "2 Have you felt the Savior near?\nStill there's more to follow;\nDoes His blessed presence cheer?\nStill there's more to follow.\nOh, the grace that Jesus shows,\nStill there's more to follow;\nFreely He His grace bestows,\nStill there's more to follow.", "3 Have you felt the Spirit's power?\nStill there's more to follow;\nFalling like the gentle shower?\nStill there's more to follow.\nOh, the power the Spirit shows,\nStill there's more to follow;\nFreely He His power bestows,\nStill there's more to follow."]
