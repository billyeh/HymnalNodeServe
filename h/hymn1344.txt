{"1": "Oh, the depth of the riches
And the wisdom and knowledge of God;
How unsearchable are His judgments;
How untraceable are His paths.
For who has known the mind of the Lord,
Or who has been His counselor?
Or who has first given to Him,
And it will be repaid to Him?
Because out of Him and through Him
And to Him are all things.
To Him be the glory forever. Amen."}
