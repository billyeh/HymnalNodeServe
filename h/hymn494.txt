{"1": "Christ is the testimony true,
Of God in essence and in deed;
God's glory He has fully shown
And we in Him God's nature read.",
"2": "His testimony is more full,
Than was the witness of the law
Which only God in letter showed
And not in endless living pow'r.",
"3": "The fulness of the Godhead dwells,
In Him, His very element;
God's full embodiment is He-
A vessel, God the resident.",
"4": "The Father God He manifests;
God's glorious features He displays;
In Him consummately are seen,
The Father's heart and all His ways.",
"5": "Christ as the Spirit now has come,
That He our portion be fore'er;
In spirit we partake of Him,
And all God's being fully share."}
