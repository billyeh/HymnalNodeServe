["1 Christ is the testimony true,\nOf God in essence and in deed;\nGod's glory He has fully shown\nAnd we in Him God's nature read.", "2 His testimony is more full,\nThan was the witness of the law\nWhich only God in letter showed\nAnd not in endless living pow'r.", "3 The fulness of the Godhead dwells,\nIn Him, His very element;\nGod's full embodiment is He-\nA vessel, God the resident.", "4 The Father God He manifests;\nGod's glorious features He displays;\nIn Him consummately are seen,\nThe Father's heart and all His ways.", "5 Christ as the Spirit now has come,\nThat He our portion be fore'er;\nIn spirit we partake of Him,\nAnd all God's being fully share."]
