{"1": "O child of the Kingdom in doubt and distress!
Why linger-thy Father is waiting to bless?
Assured of the mercy and love of thy Lord,
Claim each precious promise, take God at His Word!",
"chorus": "Take God at His Word,
Take God at His Word!
Believe every promise,
Take God at His Word!",
"2": "Thy pathway through sorrows and trials may go,
Though deep be the waters, they will not o'erflow;
Oh, trust in the Savior, His name be adored!
Confide in His promise, take God at His Word!",
"3": "He says He will guide thee through sunshine and gloom;
His presence shall brighten thy path to the throne;
And down in death's valley His voice shall be heard:
Fear not, tempted Christian, take God at His Word!",
"4": "An heir to a kingdom, and promised a crown;
With God thy protector-oh, why be cast down?
Oh, think of the triumphs of faith thou hast heard;
Be not unbelieving, take God at His Word!"}
