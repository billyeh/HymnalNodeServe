["1 I have found life's Giver, and the Prince of Life;\nHe has quenched my thirst, and vanquished all my strife.\nHe, my living bread, became my daily meat;\nDeath has died in me, Life's triumph is complete.", "2 In the Church, what glory! Far horizons glow!\nAnd His Name all radiant on each brow doth show.\nChrist doth breathe upon her, He's her living Rock,\nShepherd of His sheep all gathered in one flock.", "3 There one holy flame doth burn within each breast;\nBy one blood redeemed, in Christ they find their rest.\nAll their thirst He quenches from one living stream;\nThey in adoration lowly worship Him.", "4 There as Bread of life faint souls He ever feeds;\nThere each hungry soul may take whate'er he needs.\nLovingly He draws each soul that truly lives,\nAnd in bread and wine Himself to them He gives.", "5 Gone is all the earth-taint thru abounding grace;\nHear the song of triumph from the ransomed race.\nAll in glory shining, glory not their own,\nBlended into oneness, they approach the throne."]
