{"1": "Chosen by God in ages past,
Our God will never let us go;
Salvation is assured fore'er;
'Tis such security we know.",
"2": ""I give to them eternal life,
They shall not perish," is His word;
"No one shall snatch them from Our hands,"
This is the promise of the Lord.",
"3": "Yet there's a word for God's own sons,
Which is a warning from the Lord:
For those not ready when He comes,
"Worse punishment" and not "reward."",
"4": "Reward is not eternal life,
It's based on how we run the race;
It all depends on what we build,
It's not a matter, here, of grace.",
"5": "'Tis for God's kingdom we press on,
Like Moses, we are for the Lord;
We suffer with God's people here
And look away to the reward.",
"6": "Richer by far, reproach of Christ,
Than Egypt's treasures, which are sin;
By faith we leave Egyptian land,
Avoiding next age discipline.",
"7": "Our soul gained for the kingdom's age-
For this we lose our soul life here;
If we lay down our soul life now,
We'll save it for Christ's kingdom there.",
"8": "We all must learn to pay the price,
Christ must be worked into our soul;
'Tis thus our soul is gained by Him,
This is our aim and this our goal."}
