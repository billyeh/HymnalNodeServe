["1 Chosen by God in ages past,\nOur God will never let us go;\nSalvation is assured fore'er;\n'Tis such security we know.", "2 \"I give to them eternal life,\nThey shall not perish,\" is His word;\n\"No one shall snatch them from Our hands,\"\nThis is the promise of the Lord.", "3 Yet there's a word for God's own sons,\nWhich is a warning from the Lord:\nFor those not ready when He comes,\n\"Worse punishment\" and not \"reward.\"", "4 Reward is not eternal life,\nIt's based on how we run the race;\nIt all depends on what we build,\nIt's not a matter, here, of grace.", "5 'Tis for God's kingdom we press on,\nLike Moses, we are for the Lord;\nWe suffer with God's people here\nAnd look away to the reward.", "6 Richer by far, reproach of Christ,\nThan Egypt's treasures, which are sin;\nBy faith we leave Egyptian land,\nAvoiding next age discipline.", "7 Our soul gained for the kingdom's age-\nFor this we lose our soul life here;\nIf we lay down our soul life now,\nWe'll save it for Christ's kingdom there.", "8 We all must learn to pay the price,\nChrist must be worked into our soul;\n'Tis thus our soul is gained by Him,\nThis is our aim and this our goal."]
