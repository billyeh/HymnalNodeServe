{"1": "We are for the Lord's recovery
Of the local church;
We are for the Lord's recovery
Of the city and the earth.
Standing on the ground of oneness,
Oneness in the Lord,
We are building up the temple
Of our glorious Lord.",
"chorus": "We are for the Lord's,
We are for the Lord's,
We are for the Lord's recovery!
We are for the Lord's,
We are for the Lord's,
We are for the Lord's recovery!",
"2": "We are for the Lord's recovery,
To our hearts so dear;
When we exercise our spirit,
Our vision is so clear.
Babylon the Great is fallen,
Satan is cast down,
And the local church is builded
On the local ground."}
