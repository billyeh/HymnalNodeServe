{"1": "Day is dying in the west,
Heav'n is touching earth with rest,
Wait and worship while the night
Sets her evening lamps alight
Through all the sky.",
"chorus": "Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God of Hosts!
Heav'n and earth are full of Thee!
Heav'n and earth are praising Thee,
O Lord, most high!",
"2": "Lord of life, beneath the dome
Of the universe, Thy home,
Gather us, who seek Thy face,
To the fold of Thy embrace,
For Thou art nigh.",
"3": "While the deepening shadows fall,
Heart of love, enfolding all,
Through the glory and the grace
Of the stars that veil Thy face,
Our hearts ascend."}
