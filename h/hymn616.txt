["1 Day is dying in the west,\nHeav'n is touching earth with rest,\nWait and worship while the night\nSets her evening lamps alight\nThrough all the sky.", "chorus Holy, holy, holy,\nLord God of Hosts!\nHeav'n and earth are full of Thee!\nHeav'n and earth are praising Thee,\nO Lord, most high!", "2 Lord of life, beneath the dome\nOf the universe, Thy home,\nGather us, who seek Thy face,\nTo the fold of Thy embrace,\nFor Thou art nigh.", "3 While the deepening shadows fall,\nHeart of love, enfolding all,\nThrough the glory and the grace\nOf the stars that veil Thy face,\nOur hearts ascend."]
