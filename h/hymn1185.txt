["1 In the multitude he lay there\nWith a sickness many years;\nImpotent and lying helpless,\nEver fraught with many fears.\nWaiting for the water's moving,\nWaiting for the angel's stir;\nPowerless to move, however,\nHelpless, hopeless, lying there.", "2 At this pool how clear the picture\nOf the hopeless case of all\nWho are seeking self-perfection\nTo recover from the fall.\nThough the law is good and holy,\nFlesh, to keep the law, is dead;\nWhat we need is not religion,\nBut the Word of life instead.", "3 Though it's feast day, he's not happy,\nThough the Sabbath, there's no rest;\nLying in his poor condition,\nMiserable and sore depressed.\nAt that moment Jesus saw him,\nKnowing he was thus so long.\n\"Will you be made whole?\" He asked him,\n\"Healed and walking, well and strong?\"", "4 Though he told his hopeless story,\nScarce believing what he'd heard,\nYet, soon to his feet arising,\nHe received the living word.\nThis is all our situation,\nWe-like him-were lying there\nIn the sheep-fold of religion,\nUnder law's prevailing care.", "5 While we yet were weak and helpless,\nChrist the Son of God did come.\nBy His word we're now enlivened;\nHe's the life-imparting One!\nHallelujah for this Jesus,\nHe's the Word of life to men;\nFrom law's bondage He releases,\nDeath is turned to life again!"]
