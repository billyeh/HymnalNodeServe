{"1": "We have seen the Lord is coming
For the church for whom He died;
We are in the age of ages,
When the Lord will take His Bride!",
"chorus": "'Tis a glorious age, the age of the ages,
Now, in this age, Christ will come!
So prepare ye now the church for the marriage,
Christ and the church will be one!",
"2": "Praise God, in this age we're living,
Age of God's recovery.
We are in the local churches,
Where the Bride prepared may be.",
"3": "Unreservedly we're giving
All, that He be satisfied;
For the life and for the building
Of His holy, chosen Bride.",
"chorus": "'Tis a glorious age, the age of the ages,
Now in this age Christ will come!
We're preparing now the church for the marriage,
Christ and the church will be one!"}
