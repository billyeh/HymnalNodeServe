{"1": "Christ the Savior hath ascended,
To the heavens far above
Crowned with glory and with honor,
By the Father God in love;
He hath made Him Head of all things
His supremacy to prove.",
"2": "From this Christ to God ascended,
Hath the Spirit been outpoured
Poured upon the Church, His Body
That His members be empow'red;
Thus the Lord of all in heaven,
Thru His Church will be adored.",
"3": "In the flesh by incarnation
Into man He God hath brought;
By His death and resurrection
Into God He man hath brought;
God and man together mingled
In Himself is fully wrought.",
"4": "Now in heaven by ascension,
He is seated on the throne;
All the lordship, all the headship
He Himself doth fully own;
And by pouring out His Spirit
He as such might be made known.",
"5": "By this outpour, His descension,
On the Church was realized;
'Tis by this, that in His Spirit,
All the Church He hath baptized;
Thus the baptism of the Spirit,
Was forever actualized.",
"6": "Hallelujah, 'tis accomplished
And accomplished once for all!
Hallelujah, we're included
All included, great or small!
Praise Him, He hath sent the Spirit,
And baptized the Church withal!"}
