["1 It is not by struggling\nBut by yielding all\nI may rest from labor\nAll my burden fall.\nIt is not resolving\nBut Thyself to heed\nI'm from sin delivered,\nAnd from bondage freed.", "2 It is not by letter\nBut by Spirit 'tis\nI will be approved\nShare Thy life of bliss.\nIt is not man's teaching\nBut anointing Thine\nWhich imparts Thy light and,\nFellowship divine.", "3 It is not resolving,\nNow to run the race\nBut 'tis by Thy mercy,\nI receive Thy grace.\nIt is not by knowledge\nBut by grace alone\nI can pass thru suff'ring,\nTo Thine image grown.", "4 Not by lofty phrases\nBut by power Thine\nI the lost can pilot,\nUnto life divine.\nIt is not my wisdom\nBut Thy Spirit, Lord\nWhich alone can fit me,\nTo fulfill Thy Word."]
