{"1": "It is not by struggling
But by yielding all
I may rest from labor
All my burden fall.
It is not resolving
But Thyself to heed
I'm from sin delivered,
And from bondage freed.",
"2": "It is not by letter
But by Spirit 'tis
I will be approved
Share Thy life of bliss.
It is not man's teaching
But anointing Thine
Which imparts Thy light and,
Fellowship divine.",
"3": "It is not resolving,
Now to run the race
But 'tis by Thy mercy,
I receive Thy grace.
It is not by knowledge
But by grace alone
I can pass thru suff'ring,
To Thine image grown.",
"4": "Not by lofty phrases
But by power Thine
I the lost can pilot,
Unto life divine.
It is not my wisdom
But Thy Spirit, Lord
Which alone can fit me,
To fulfill Thy Word."}
