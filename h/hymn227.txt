{"1": "Through the bread and cup, Lord Jesus
We Thy death exhibit here;
What Thy love has done reviewing
All Thy suff'ring we revere.
Bread and cup in separation
Show that Thou thru death hast gone;
Grateful now, our spirit worships
And to Thee we give our song.",
"chorus": "Thine the cup of suff'ring
Mine the cup of blessing;
For Thy love in Thy redemption
Praise we ever sing!",
"2": "Thou, in love, hast shed Thy blood, Lord
Bringing us to God in grace
That from God, no longer severed
We may ever see His face.
All God's righteousness and glory,
Have been fully satisfied;
Thru Thy death's abundant merit,
We may now with God abide.",
"3": "By Thy death the veil was riven
Opened was the holiest place
All the barriers have been broken;
We approach the throne of grace
There receiving grace and mercy
Thus the timely need to meet
Drinking as of living water
Tasting God Himself replete.",
"4": "Thou in grace hast so redeemed us
We the priests may be fore'er,
To fulfill that holy office
All God's sweetness thus to share.
Such a blessing, such a mercy
From Thy death for us ensue;
We would ever Thee remember,
Till with Thee we drink anew."}
