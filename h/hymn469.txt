["1 Who is on the Lord's side?\nWho will serve the King?\nWho will be His helpers,\nOther lives to bring?\nWho will leave the world's side?\nWho will face the foe?\nWho is on the Lord's side?\nWho for Him will go?", "chorus By Thy grand redemption,\nBy Thy grace divine,\nWe are on the Lord's side;\nSavior, we are Thine.", "2 Not for weight of glory,\nNot for crown and palm,\nEnter we the army,\nRaise the warrior psalm;\nBut for love that claimeth\nLives for whom He died;\nHe whom Jesus nameth\nMust be on His side.", "3 Jesus, Thou hast bought us,\nNot with gold or gem,\nBut with Thine own life-blood,\nFor Thy diadem;\nWith Thy blessing filling\nEach who comes to Thee,\nThou hast made us willing,\nThou hast made us free.", "4 Fierce may be the conflict,\nStrong may be the foe,\nBut the King's own army\nNone can overthrow.\nRound His standard ranging\nVictory is secure,\nFor His truth unchanging\nMakes the triumph sure.", "5 Chosen to be soldiers\nIn an alien land:\nChosen, called, and faithful,\nFor our Captain's band;\nIn the service royal\nLet us not grow cold;\nLet us be right loyal,\nNoble, true, and bold."]
