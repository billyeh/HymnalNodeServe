["1 Rock of Ages, cleft for me,\nLet me hide myself in Thee;\nLet the water and the blood,\nFrom Thy riven side which flowed,\nBe of sin the double cure,\nSave me from its guilt and power.", "2 Not the labor of my hands\nCan fulfill Thy law's demands;\nCould my zeal no respite know,\nCould my tears forever flow,\nAll could never sin erase,\nThou must save, and save by grace.", "3 Nothing in my hands I bring,\nSimply to Thy cross I cling;\nNaked, come to Thee for dress,\nHelpless, look to Thee for grace:\nFoul, I to the fountain fly,\nWash me, Savior, or I die.", "4 While I draw this fleeting breath,\nWhen mine eyes shall close in death,\nWhen I soar to worlds unknown,\nSee Thee on Thy judgment throne,\nRock of Ages, cleft for me,\nLet me hide myself in Thee."]
