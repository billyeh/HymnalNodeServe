["1 We're gathered here, O Lord, as Thy one Body:\nThough we be many, yet we all are one.\nWe share Thy life and own that we are members,\nAnd thus within, in life we all are one.", "chorus There is one Body in this universe,\nAnd we express it here on earth;\nWe stand as one in each locality\nFor all to see, for all to see.", "2 There is one loaf, the symbol of Thy body:\n'Twas broken so that all the saints may share.\nWe eat this bread and, as we are partaking,\nOur actual oneness with all saints declare.", "3 One bread, one cup are now upon the table,\nShowing that we can be naught else but one.\nChrist has redeemed us, made us His own Body:\nWhat can we say but, \"Amen, Lord, we're one!\"", "4 We stand as one, and cannot be divided,\nBecause our oneness is of Christ alone.\nWe eat as one: \"one loaf, one cup partaking,\nAnd thus our oneness visibly is shown.", "5 Oh, what a joy to have this blessed oneness!\nWe sense that Thou, O Lord, art satisfied;\nAnd we too share this blissful satisfaction-\nSweet foretaste of the Bridegroom with His Bride."]
