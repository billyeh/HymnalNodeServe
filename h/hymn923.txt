{"1": "Go to collect materials for the House
Go to convince dear souls and bring them in;
Bring in the very souls whom God has made
Bring in the souls usurped by every sin.",
"2": "Go to collect materials for the House
Go to deliver people from the world
From all Satanic darkness and deceit
From the allurements Satan has unfurled.",
"3": "Go to collect materials for the House
Go to win souls to glorify the Lord;
Go to defeat the enemy of God
Go, sinners to release, with one accord.",
"4": "Go to collect materials for the House
Go, Christ proclaiming, on the Body ground;
Go thus in oneness with the faithful saints
And let the trumpet of the gospel sound."}
