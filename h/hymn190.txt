{"1": "O Lord, as we consider Thee
We worship Thee for all Thou art;
Thou art so rich, so wonderful
So dear and precious to our heart.",
"chorus": "What Thou art meets our every need!
Our hearts o'erflow with praise to Thee!
All our desires Thou dost exceed,
And satisfy continually.",
"2": "Thou art the very God in truth
The God who is both love and light;
The God who is to us our life
The God in whom we all delight.",
"3": "Thou also art a man indeed
A man so fine, so good, so pure;
A man in whom our God delights
A man who can our love secure.",
"4": "Thou even art a lowly slave
A slave of God to serve for us;
Obedient to the cross's death,
That we might be delivered thus.",
"5": "Thou art, beside all these, a King
A King in life and love to reign
By God anointed with His pow'r,
To rule with us in His domain.",
"6": "Dear Lord, as we remember Thee
We thus partake of all Thou art;
As we enjoy Thyself in love
We share Thee as Thy counterpart."}
