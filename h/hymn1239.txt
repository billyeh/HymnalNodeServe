{"1": "In this age we're being turned
To the Spirit to be burned;
Now in spirit we can see
Christ, the church, our unity!",
"2": "In the spirit we can taste
All the riches of Thy grace;
All Thy fullness, blessed Lord
Is for those in one accord!",
"3": "In the spirit, on the ground-
Here is where Thy life is found.
Dwelling thus in unity,
We enjoy reality!",
"4": "Out of death and into life,
Done with all divisive strife!
Free indeed to love but Thee,
Growing to maturity!",
"5": ""Amen, Jesus," is our prayer
To the purging work, whate'er;
Now Thy church must desperate be
More the growth in life to see.",
"6": "O Lord, make Thy home our heart,
Our true inner man Thou art;
God and man are mingled thus-
Christ, the church, all glorious!"}
