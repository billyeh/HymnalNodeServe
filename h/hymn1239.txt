["1 In this age we're being turned\nTo the Spirit to be burned;\nNow in spirit we can see\nChrist, the church, our unity!", "2 In the spirit we can taste\nAll the riches of Thy grace;\nAll Thy fullness, blessed Lord\nIs for those in one accord!", "3 In the spirit, on the ground-\nHere is where Thy life is found.\nDwelling thus in unity,\nWe enjoy reality!", "4 Out of death and into life,\nDone with all divisive strife!\nFree indeed to love but Thee,\nGrowing to maturity!", "5 \"Amen, Jesus,\" is our prayer\nTo the purging work, whate'er;\nNow Thy church must desperate be\nMore the growth in life to see.", "6 O Lord, make Thy home our heart,\nOur true inner man Thou art;\nGod and man are mingled thus-\nChrist, the church, all glorious!"]
