{"1": "All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,",
"chorus": "And crown Him, crown Him, crown Him,
Crown Him Lord of all!",
"2": "Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God
Who from His altar call;
Extol the Stem of Jesse's rod,",
"3": "Hail Him, ye heirs of David's line,
Whom David Lord did call;
The God incarnate. Man Divine;",
"4": "Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,",
"5": "Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget
The wormwood and the gall,
Go, spread your trophies at His feet.",
"6": "Let every kindred, every tribe,
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,",
"7": "O that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall!
We'll join the everlasting song,"}
