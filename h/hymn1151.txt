["1 Drink! A river pure and clear that's flowing from the throne;\nEat! The tree of life with fruits abundant, richly grown;\nLook! No need of lamp nor sun nor moon to keep it bright, for\nHere there is no night!", "chorus Do come, oh, do come,\nSays Spirit and the Bride:\nDo come, oh, do come,\nLet him that heareth, cry.\nDo come, oh, do come,\nLet him who thirsts and will\nTake freely the water of life!", "2 Christ, our river, Christ, our water, springing from within;\nChrist, our tree, and Christ, the fruits, to be enjoyed therein,\nChrist, our day, and Christ, our light, and Christ, our morningstar:\nChrist, our everything!", "3 We are washing all our robes the tree of life to eat;\n\"O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!\"-Jesus is so sweet!\nWe our spirits exercise, and thus experience Christ.\nWhat a Christ have we!", "4 Now we have a home so bright that outshines the sun,\nWhere the brothers all unite and truly are one.\nJesus gets us all together, Him we now display\nIn the local church."]
