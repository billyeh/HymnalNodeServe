["1 Lord, Thou art God's anointed\nThou art of kings the King!\nHere in full adoration,\nOur song to Thee we bring!\nThy kingdom is forever\nEstablished is Thy throne!\nThy reign with love and justice,\nIn glory stands alone!", "2 Upon the hill of Zion,\nHath God established Thee,\nAnd all the nations given,\nThy heritage to be.\nTo Thee hath God committed,\nHis full authority,\nTo rule with might the nations,\nUnto eternity.", "3 Before the time of fulness\nWhile darkness still prevails\nTen thousands daily render,\nTo Thee their loyal hails!\nFrom shore to shore Thy people,\nTo Thee their praises sing;\nThey worship, love, and serve Thee,\nAs their dear Savior-King!", "4 When in the time appointed,\nWith glory Thou wilt come\nThe earth with all its nations,\nThy kingdom will become.\nIn majesty and splendor,\nWilt Thou be served as King\nAll kindreds and all peoples,\nTo Thee their praise shall ring!"]
