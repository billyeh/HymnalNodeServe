{"1": "Lord, Thou art God's anointed
Thou art of kings the King!
Here in full adoration,
Our song to Thee we bring!
Thy kingdom is forever
Established is Thy throne!
Thy reign with love and justice,
In glory stands alone!",
"2": "Upon the hill of Zion,
Hath God established Thee,
And all the nations given,
Thy heritage to be.
To Thee hath God committed,
His full authority,
To rule with might the nations,
Unto eternity.",
"3": "Before the time of fulness
While darkness still prevails
Ten thousands daily render,
To Thee their loyal hails!
From shore to shore Thy people,
To Thee their praises sing;
They worship, love, and serve Thee,
As their dear Savior-King!",
"4": "When in the time appointed,
With glory Thou wilt come
The earth with all its nations,
Thy kingdom will become.
In majesty and splendor,
Wilt Thou be served as King
All kindreds and all peoples,
To Thee their praise shall ring!"}
