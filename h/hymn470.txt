{"1": "Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
One in Three, and Three in One,
As by the celestial host,
Let Thy will on earth be done;
Praise by all to Thee be giv'n,
Glorious Lord of earth and heav'n!",
"2": "Vilest of the sinful race,
Lo, I answer to Thy call:
Meanest vessel of Thy grace,
Grace divinely free for all;
Lo, I come to do Thy will,
All Thy counsel to fulfil.",
"3": "If so poor a worm as I,
May to Thy great glory live,
All my actions sanctify,
All my words and thoughts receive;
Claim me for Thy service, claim
All I have, and all I am.",
"4": "Take my soul and body's powers,
Take my mem'ry, mind, and will;
All my goods and all my hours,
All I know, and all I feel;
All I think, or speak, or do;
Take my heart, but make it new.",
"5": "Now, O God, Thine own I am,
Now I give Thee back Thine own:
Freedom, friends, and health, and fame,
Consecrate to Thee alone;
Thine I live, thrice happy I;
Happier still when Thine I die."}
