["1 The name of Jesus is our stand\nIt is our victory;\nNot on ourselves do we rely\nBut, mighty Lord, on Thee.\nOur weapons are not arms of flesh\nBut ours the Spirit's sword\nAnd God's whole armor putting on\nWe battle in the Lord.", "2 Behold, the foe doth meet and plot\nStand firm in one accord!\nThough war be fierce and darkness thick\nResist him in the Lord!\nIf one thru fear should backward turn\nHe undermines the rest.\nOh, do not let your brothers down\nNor by you be distressed.", "3 The devil knows his time is short\nHe is the more enraged\nAnd by his wiles would weaken us,\nBefore the battle's waged.\nThe trials now more numerous are\nThe suff'ring e'en more sore\nThe force of hell opposing us,\nMore dreadful than before.", "4 What should our posture be today,\nIn such a desperate hour?\nShould we our ease and pleasure seek,\nAnd let the foe devour?\nOr with increasing conflict strong\nCourageous to endure?\n'Tis here that life or death is won!\nWho will God's praise secure?", "5 For Christ the Lord we then would stand\nHe is the Conqueror!\nFor Him we would endure the pain,\nUntil the fight is o'er.\nThe hour of triumph soon we'll see-\nThe Lord will come again;\nIf now we suffer for His sake\nThen we with Him shall reign."]
