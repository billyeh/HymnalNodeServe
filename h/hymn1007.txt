["1 Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing pow'r?\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?\nAre you fully trusting in His grace this hour?\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?", "chorus Are you washed in the blood,\nIn the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?\nAre your garments spotless? Are they white as snow?\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?", "2 Are you walking daily by the Savior's side?\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?\nDo you rest each moment in the Crucified?\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?", "3 When the Bridegroom cometh will your robes be white!\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?\nWill your soul be ready for His presence bright,\nAnd be washed in the blood of the Lamb?", "4 Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin,\nAnd be washed in the blood of the Lamb;\nThere's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean,\nO be washed in the blood of the Lamb."]
