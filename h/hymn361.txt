{"1": "O Love divine, by Christ revealed,
Incarnate Love that died for me,
To Thee myself I gladly yield,
I consecrate my all to Thee.",
"2": "O Light divine, by Christ displayed,
Source of all light, who flesh became,
Shed Thy bright beams upon my head,
Burn in my heart a constant flame.",
"3": "O Truth divine, by Christ made known,
All truth must Thy reflection be;
Within my heart set up Thy throne,
And in Thy freedom make me free.",
"4": "O Cross divine, by Christ endured,
Thou cross on which He groaned and died,
And man's redemption thus secured,
In Thy blest shadow let me hide.",
"5": "O Peace divine, by Christ bestowed,
Thy heavenly dove to earth come down,
May He within make His abode,
My life with His dear presence crown.",
"6": "O Joy divine, by Christ possessed,
For which He did the cross endure,
Fill with Thyself and make me blest,
Contented, restful and secure."}
