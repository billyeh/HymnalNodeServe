{"1": "Fill me with Thy gracious Spirit,
Fill my longing spirit now;
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Come, dear Lord, and fill me now!",
"chorus": "Fill me now! Fill me now!
Fill me with Thy Spirit now!
Strip me wholly, empty throughly,
Fill me with Thy Spirit now!",
"2": "Thou can'st fill me with Thy Spirit,
Though I cannot tell Thee how;
But I need Thee, greatly need Thee;
Come, dear Lord, and fill me now!",
"3": "I am weakness, full of weakness;
At Thy sacred feet I bow;
By Thy blest, eternal Spirit,
Fill with strength, and fill me now!",
"4": "Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me;
Fill my broken spirit now!
Thou art comforting and saving,
Thou art sweetly filling now."}
