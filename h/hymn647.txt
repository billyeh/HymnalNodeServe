["1 Trust Him when thy wants are many;\nTrust Him when thy friends are few;\nAnd the time of swift temptation\nIs the time to trust Him too.", "2 Trust Him when thy soul is burdened\nWith the sense of all its sin;\nHe will speak the word of pardon,\nHe will make thee clean within.", "3 Trust Him for the grace sufficient,\nEver equal to thy need;\nTrust Him always for the answer,\nWhen in His dear name you plead.", "4 Trust Him for the grace to conquer,\nHe is able to subdue;\nTrust Him for the power for service;\nTrust Him for the blessing too.", "5 Trust Him when dark doubts assail thee,\nTrust Him when thy strength is small,\nTrust Him when to simply trust Him\nSeems the hardest thing of all.", "6 Trust Him; He is ever faithful;\nTrust Him, for His will is best;\nTrust Him, for the heart of Jesus\nIs the only place of rest.", "7 Trust Him, then, through cloud or sunshine,\nAll thy cares upon Him cast,\nTill the storm of life is over,\nAnd the trusting days are past."]
