{"1": "Trust Him when thy wants are many;
Trust Him when thy friends are few;
And the time of swift temptation
Is the time to trust Him too.",
"2": "Trust Him when thy soul is burdened
With the sense of all its sin;
He will speak the word of pardon,
He will make thee clean within.",
"3": "Trust Him for the grace sufficient,
Ever equal to thy need;
Trust Him always for the answer,
When in His dear name you plead.",
"4": "Trust Him for the grace to conquer,
He is able to subdue;
Trust Him for the power for service;
Trust Him for the blessing too.",
"5": "Trust Him when dark doubts assail thee,
Trust Him when thy strength is small,
Trust Him when to simply trust Him
Seems the hardest thing of all.",
"6": "Trust Him; He is ever faithful;
Trust Him, for His will is best;
Trust Him, for the heart of Jesus
Is the only place of rest.",
"7": "Trust Him, then, through cloud or sunshine,
All thy cares upon Him cast,
Till the storm of life is over,
And the trusting days are past."}
