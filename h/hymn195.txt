{"1": "Lord, Thou art all the offerings,
Prepared by God for us;
They are so rich in meaning
So sweet and glorious.
They have fulfilled God's purpose,
And met His heart's desire;
They too have satisfied us
And faced what we require.",
"2": "Thou art the burnt-oblation
Consumed by holy fire;
To God as a sweet savor
Fulfilling His desire.
Thou walkedst in God's presence
And all His will pursued;
Thyself the spotless offering
For us to God as food.",
"3": "Thou art the meal-oblation
With "oil" and "frankincense"
'Tis holy, fine, and perfect
And sweet to every sense.
Thou art the peace-oblation
The peace for us to make
That we with God may share Thee
As food of Thee partake.",
"4": "Thou art the sin-oblation
For us Thou sin wast made;
By death for our redemption,
The ransom Thou hast paid.
Thou art the trespass-offering
Thou all our sins didst bear,
To satisfy God's justice
That we His pardon share.",
"5": "Thou art the wave-oblation
The resurrected One;
O'er hades, death and darkness
The vict'ry Thou hast won.
Thou art the heave-oblation
Thou didst ascend to God;
As such in heav'nly places,
Thou art our holy food."}
