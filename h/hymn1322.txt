{"1": "In spirit, in the church we see
The high estate we're destined for.
It's higher, vaster, more profound
Than anything we've seen before.",
"2": "It's not a view in doctrine bare
But an unveiling of the Christ.
He's marvelous and far beyond
Our mental thought or power to share.",
"3": "He's rich, unlimited, profound,
Immeasurable, and marvelous.
Yet 'tis a greater wonder still
He needs heirs of salvation-us.",
"4": "God has accomplished many things-
He's planned, created, and brought forth.
The Son is now appointed Heir,
Administrator of God's worth.",
"5": "But in th' economy of God
There is not one, but many sons.
One is the firstborn Son of God
With many other living ones.",
"6": "Christ will inherit all God's things,
And we're the heirs of God with Christ.
We're growing now to be matured;
As heirs we'll soon be legalized.",
"7": "We're joint-heirs with the firstborn Son,
Inheriting the universe.
We're in this corporation vast-
All partners of Christ and the church.",
"8": "In spirit, in the church, we see
Our calling of unrivaled worth.
We're destined, not to go to heaven.
We're destined to be kings on earth.",
"9": "We're paupers, yet we're glorious kings.
Inheriting the kingdom vast,
The earth, God's throne, and e'en all things
And all the Father is and has."}
