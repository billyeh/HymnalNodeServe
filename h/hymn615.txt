{"1": "Begin the day with God!
He is thy Sun and Day!
His is the radiance of thy dawn;
To Him address thy lay.",
"2": "Sing a new song at morn!
Join the glad woods and hills;
Join the fresh winds and seas and plains,
Join the bright flowers and rills.",
"3": "Sing thy first song to God!
Not to thy fellow men;
Not to the creatures of His hand,
But to the glorious One.",
"4": "Take thy first walk with God!
Let Him go forth with thee;
By stream, or sea, or mountain path,
Seek still His company.",
"5": "Thy first transaction be
With God Himself above;
So shall thy business prosper well
And all the day be love."}
