["1 Behold the New Jerusalem descends from God.\nThe Triune God Himself in His intrinsic essence\nNow consummately dwells in them and they in Him.\nBehold the New Jerusalem descends from God.\nIllumined by the light of life they walk the way-\nOf life, and eat the tree of life and drink the river.\nAnd thus enjoying God fore'er, they're one with Him,\nAs the very processed Triune God dispenses Himself to them."]
