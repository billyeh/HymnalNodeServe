{"1": "Behold the New Jerusalem descends from God.
The Triune God Himself in His intrinsic essence
Now consummately dwells in them and they in Him.
Behold the New Jerusalem descends from God.
Illumined by the light of life they walk the way-
Of life, and eat the tree of life and drink the river.
And thus enjoying God fore'er, they're one with Him,
As the very processed Triune God dispenses Himself to them."}
