{"1": "Thou, Father, who art Spirit true
The holiest of all;
We worship in the spirit now
In truth upon Thee call.",
"2": "A spirit Thou hast made for us,
That we may worship Thee
That echoing in spirit thus,
One spirit we will be.",
"3": "The Father in the Son has come
The Son the Spirit is
That to our spirit God may come.
O what a grace is this!",
"4": "The Son is Thine eternal Word
The Word is Spirit too;
The Spirit as our life has come,
Our spirit to renew.",
"5": "Thy Spirit in our spirit is
And thus in unity,
Thy Spirit witnesseth with ours,
That we are born of Thee.",
"6": "In everything Thy Spirit leads,
That we may follow Him;
We thus may spiritual become
With life and peace within.",
"7": "In spirit we would worship Thee
In spirit Thee address
Until our spirit is released,
Thine image to express.",
"8": "Our Father, we would praise Thee now,
That Thou the Spirit art;
In spirit and in truth to Thee,
True worship we impart."}
