["1 Every thread I wind this day,\nEvery footstep on life's way,\nEvery clod I shall unearth,\nEvery task, whate'er its worth:\nOnly for God's glory living,\nBlessing, praise and honor giving!", "2 All the burdens of the day,\nAll the words which I shall say,\nAll the works my God may send,\nAll the hours in rest I spend:\nEver for His glory living,\nBlessing, praise and honor giving!", "3 Every blood-drop in the heart,\nEvery grief and aching smart,\nEvery bitter pulse of pain,\nEvery hour of joy again:\nOnly for God's glory living,\nBlessing, praise and honor giving!", "4 As I take my daily food,\nGreet another on life's road,\nPluck a flower beside the way,\nStoop to lift a wisp of hay:\nEver for God's glory living,\nBlessing, praise and honor giving!", "5 All, from deeds of little worth,\nTo the greatest things on earth;\nMine to build some world to be,\nOr to lie and gaze on Thee:\nFor Thy glory daily living,\nBlessing, praise and honor giving!"]
