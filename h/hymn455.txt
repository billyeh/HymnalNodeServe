{"1": "Every thread I wind this day,
Every footstep on life's way,
Every clod I shall unearth,
Every task, whate'er its worth:
Only for God's glory living,
Blessing, praise and honor giving!",
"2": "All the burdens of the day,
All the words which I shall say,
All the works my God may send,
All the hours in rest I spend:
Ever for His glory living,
Blessing, praise and honor giving!",
"3": "Every blood-drop in the heart,
Every grief and aching smart,
Every bitter pulse of pain,
Every hour of joy again:
Only for God's glory living,
Blessing, praise and honor giving!",
"4": "As I take my daily food,
Greet another on life's road,
Pluck a flower beside the way,
Stoop to lift a wisp of hay:
Ever for God's glory living,
Blessing, praise and honor giving!",
"5": "All, from deeds of little worth,
To the greatest things on earth;
Mine to build some world to be,
Or to lie and gaze on Thee:
For Thy glory daily living,
Blessing, praise and honor giving!"}
