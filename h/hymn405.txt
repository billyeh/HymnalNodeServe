["1 Having seen the world's fair beauty,\nLord, I would be blind once more,\nLest I lose the loving Presence\nAnd Delight I knew before.", "chorus Having seen the world's fair beauty,\nLord, I would be blind once more,\nLest I lose the loving Presence\nAnd Delight I knew before.", "2 Dawn and sunset, star and moonlight,\nI can see in paradise,\nBut while here on earth His mercy\nFor my blindness will suffice.", "3 I no more would be delivered\nFrom my thorn, but look for grace,\nWhile within the veil His glory\nShineth brightly on my face.", "4 In the deep dark night, His beauty\nI by faith, not sight, may trace;\nHe was ridiculed and hated,\nYet I see His glorious face.", "5 Sun and moonlight far surpassing,\nClouds and Milky Way o'erspread,\nIs the glory all transcending\nShining from His thorn-crowned head."]
