{"1": "O God, Thou art the source of life
Divine, and rich and free!
As living water flowing out,
Unto eternity!",
"2": "In love Thou in the Son didst flow,
Among the human race;
Thou dost as Spirit also flow,
Within us thru Thy grace.",
"3": "Though we in sin and wickedness,
Went far from Thee apace
Yet in the Son Thou didst redeem
Bestowing life and grace.",
"4": "Though we have often slighted Thee
Thy Spirit often grieved
Yet Thou dost still as Spirit come,
As life to be received.",
"5": "Thou as the Spirit in the Son,
Hast mingled heretofore;
Thou wilt thru fellowship anoint,
And increase more and more.",
"6": "The love of God, the grace of Christ
The Spirit's flowing free
Enable us God's wealth to share,
Thru all eternity.",
"7": "The Father, Son, and Spirit-one
So richly care for us;
Thy love with one accord we sing,
And e'er would praise Thee thus."}
