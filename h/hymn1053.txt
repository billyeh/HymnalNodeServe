["1 With broken heart and contrite sigh,\nA trembling sinner, Lord, I cry;\nThy pard'ning grace is rich and free:\nO God, be merciful to me!", "2 I smite upon my troubled breast,\nWith deep and conscious guilt oppressed;\nChrist and His cross my only plea:\nO God, be merciful to me!", "3 Far off I stand with tearful eyes,\nNor dare uplift them to the skies;\nBut Thou dost all my anguish see,\nO God, be merciful to me!", "4 With alms, or deeds that I have done,\nNot one sin's pardon can be won;\nTo Calvary alone I flee;\nO God, be merciful to me!", "5 And when redeemed from sin and hell,\nWith all the ransomed throng I dwell,\nMy raptured song shall ever be,\nGod has been merciful to me!"]
