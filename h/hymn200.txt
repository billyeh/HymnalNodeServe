{"1": "Thou art the Sun of righteousness,
With healing in Thy wings;
The shining of Thy glorious face,
To us Thy riches brings.",
"2": "The tender mercy of our God,
Caused Thee on us to dawn
To those in darkness giving light,
That shades of death be gone.",
"3": "Thou art the Morning without clouds
And as the Morning Light;
We are the tender grass on earth
Who in Thy rays delight.",
"4": "Thy shining light with pleasant rays,
Increases all the way;
It shines within us more and more,
Until the perfect day.",
"5": "It shines thru woe with clearest beams
As shining after rain;
And in Thy mercy with Thy love,
Thy shining e'er remains.",
"6": "Thou also art the Morning Star,
To us as a reward;
While still 'tis dark it shines with light,
To those who love the Lord.",
"7": "Lord, help us e'er to love Thy light,
And see things from afar;
And look for Thee in watch and prayer,
As for the Morning Star."}
