["1 When we survey the wondrous cross\nOn which the Lord of glory died, \nOur richest gain we count but loss,\nAnd pour contempt on all our pride.", "2 Our God forbid that we should boast,\nSave in the death of Christ, our Lord;\nAll the vain things that charm us most,\nWe'd sacrifice them to His blood.", "3 There from His head, His hands, His feet,\nSorrow and love flowed mingled down;\nDid e'er such love and sorrow meet,\nOr thorns compose so rich a crown?", "4 His dying crimson, from His head\nSpreads o'er His body on the tree;\nTo all the world then am I dead,\nAnd all the world is dead to me.", "5 Were the whole realm of nature ours,\nThat were an offering far too small;\nLove that transcends our highest pow'rs,\nDemands our heart, our life, our all."]
