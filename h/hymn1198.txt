["1 A mighty flowing-out is God,\nHe flows throughout the ages.\nAnd so to flow Himself to man\nHe is in many stages;\nYet still one God is He,\nOne flow eternally;\nHis stages pave the way\nTo flow through man today,\nAnd now He flows within us!", "2 In the beginning we can see,\nGod as a flowing river,\nThe river to convey the tree,\nHimself as life deliver.\nAnd at the end the same,\nThe river doth remain,\nGod in the Lamb doth flow,\nThe tree prevails to grow,\nAnd God flows on forever.", "3 God flowed Himself into a man,\nThe man we call Christ Jesus.\nHe gave up His own life for man\nAnd God's own life releases.\nThough Satan did his best\nTo put God's flow to rest-\nHe had Him crucified\nAnd cruelly pierced His side-\nBut out came blood and water!", "4 The blood and water flowed from Him,\nIn streams of pure salvation.\nThe blood brings cleansing from all sin;\nWater, regeneration.\nAnd now the Spirit flows,\nBrings God where'er He goes.\nAll he could do, the foe,\nWas just release the flow.\nAnd God just keeps on flowing."]
