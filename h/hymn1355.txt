["1 God has forgiven all my sins;\nBehind His back they all are cast.\nHe'll never call to mind again\nThe sins He vanquished in the past.", "chorus God has forgiven all my sins,\nAnd as a gloomy cloud is blown,\nMy sins are vanished all away!\nNo more will they be seen or known.", "2 My sins were like a heavy stone\nGod cast and buried in the sea.\nAs east so far from west is thrown,\nMy sins have been removed from me!"]
