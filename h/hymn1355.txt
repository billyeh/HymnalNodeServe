{"1": "God has forgiven all my sins;
Behind His back they all are cast.
He'll never call to mind again
The sins He vanquished in the past.",
"chorus": "God has forgiven all my sins,
And as a gloomy cloud is blown,
My sins are vanished all away!
No more will they be seen or known.",
"2": "My sins were like a heavy stone
God cast and buried in the sea.
As east so far from west is thrown,
My sins have been removed from me!"}
