["1 Out in the highways and byways of life,\nMany are weary and sad;\nCarry the sunshine where darkness is rife,\nMaking the sorrowing glad.", "chorus Make me a blessing, make me a blessing,\nOut of my life may Jesus shine;\nMake me a blessing, O Savior, I pray,\nMake me a blessing to someone today.", "2 Tell the sweet story of Christ and His love,\nTell of His pow'r to forgive;\nOthers will trust Him if only you prove\nTrue, every moment you live.", "3 Give as 'twas given to you in your need,\nLove as the Master loved you;\nBe to the helpless a helper indeed,\nUnto your mission be true."]
