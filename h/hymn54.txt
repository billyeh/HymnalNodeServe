["1 O God and Father, we our praises bring,\nFor who more worthy of our praise could be\nThan Thou, who seekest worshipers who sing\nIn spirit and in truth adoringly!", "2 All worlds Thou hast created by the Son,\nAll things are held by His unmeasured power;\nYet we approach Thee in that glorious One:\nWhat cause for worship in this holy hour!", "3 'Tis He who leads us in this blessed sphere,\nIn the assembly singing praise to Thee;\nWhat joy to Him that we should thus be near\nAs suited and in perfect liberty!", "4 Here we unite, our song of joy is one!\nAnd Thou, O God, art fully satisfied.\nAmidst the praises led by Christ, Thy Son,\nThou hast a dwelling ever to abide."]
