{"1": "Oh, blow upon us, Lord, while here we wait on Thee;
Oh, blow with mighty wind and bring us liberty;
Oh, blow till in our midst revival we shall see;
Oh, blow upon us, Lord, we pray!",
"chorus": "Oh, blow upon us, Lord, today!
Oh, blow all sloth and sleep away!
Oh, may Thy wind descend
All our backsliding end!
Oh, blow upon us, Lord, we pray!",
"2": "Oh, blow with love divine and stir up our cold heart;
Oh, blow and to our soul the breath of' heav'n impart:
Oh, blow till from each one indifference shall depart;
Oh, blow upon us, Lord, we pray!",
"3": "Oh, blow with pow'r from heav'n our spirit to inspire:
Oh, blow and quicken us and fill with Thy desire;
Oh, blow till all of us be wholly set on fire;
Oh, blow upon us, Lord, we pray!"}
