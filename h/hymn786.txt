{"1": "Pray to labor with the Lord
Pray to pave the way for Him;
Pray to move Him and be moved,
From the center to the rim.",
"2": "Pray to labor with the Lord
Be identified with Him,
In His purpose and His aim,
Till His blessing floodeth in.",
"3": "Pray to labor with the Lord;
Self-ambition and self-will,
We must ever cast away
All His purpose to fulfill.",
"4": "Pray to labor with the Lord;
Let the Lord initiate,
All the plan and all the work;
Then thru us He'll operate.",
"5": "Pray to labor with the Lord,
Till the wheel begins to move;
Pray together with the Lord,
Till the Church His pow'r shall prove."}
