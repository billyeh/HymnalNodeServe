{"1": "Thou art the Word and Spirit, Lord;
Now in one spirit worship we;
'Tis by the Word we understand
And in the Spirit contact Thee.",
"2": "Since Thou with me hast joined in one
Thou art my all, O Lord, thereby;
And as the Spirit and the Word,
Thou cam'st to me as my supply.",
"3": "If Thou art Lord, yet not the Word
How couldest Thou be known to me?
If Thou art God yet Spirit not
How could I ever contact Thee?",
"4": "The Word reveals Thyself to me,
And knowledge of Thyself imparts;
The Spirit is Thy substance true,
Whereby I touch Thee as Thou art.",
"5": "Thou art my life, my light, my way
My food, my strength and guaranty;
By Word made known, as Spirit these,
Become experience to me.",
"6": "Thy Word in Scripture is expressed
Thy Spirit, the Indwelling One;
Thy Word is spirit and is life,
When to my spirit it doth come.",
"7": "If I Thy Word would understand
I must Thy Holy Spirit touch;
Not only grasp it with my mind
But with my spirit, praying much.",
"8": "Thy precious Word my heart doth love
My spirit fellowships with Thine;
My heart rejoices in Thy Word
My spirit praises sings in Thine."}
