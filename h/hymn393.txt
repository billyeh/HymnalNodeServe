["1 Thy way, not mine, O Lord,\nHowever dark it be;\nLead me by Thine own hand,\nChoose out the Path for me.", "2 Smooth let it be, or rough,\nIt will be still the best;\nWinding or straight it leads\nRight onward to Thy rest.", "3 I dare not choose my lot;\nI would not if I might:\nChoose Thou for me, my God,\nSo shall I walk aright.", "4 Take Thou my cup, and it\nWith joy or sorrow fill,\nAs best to Thee may seem;\nChoose Thou my good and ill.", "5 Choose Thou for me my friends,\nMy sickness or my health.\nChoose Thou my cares for me,\nMy poverty or wealth.", "6 Not mine, not mine the choice,\nIn things both great and small;\nBe Thou my guide, my strength,\nMy wisdom and my all."]
