{"1": "Thy way, not mine, O Lord,
However dark it be;
Lead me by Thine own hand,
Choose out the Path for me.",
"2": "Smooth let it be, or rough,
It will be still the best;
Winding or straight it leads
Right onward to Thy rest.",
"3": "I dare not choose my lot;
I would not if I might:
Choose Thou for me, my God,
So shall I walk aright.",
"4": "Take Thou my cup, and it
With joy or sorrow fill,
As best to Thee may seem;
Choose Thou my good and ill.",
"5": "Choose Thou for me my friends,
My sickness or my health.
Choose Thou my cares for me,
My poverty or wealth.",
"6": "Not mine, not mine the choice,
In things both great and small;
Be Thou my guide, my strength,
My wisdom and my all."}
