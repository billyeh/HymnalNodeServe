{"1": "Lo, from vessels, earthen only,
Shining forth in ceaseless grace,
Reaching weary hearts, and lonely,
Beams the light from Jesus' face!",
"2": "Christ, the light that fills the heavens
Shining forth on earth beneath,
Through His Spirit freely given
Light of life 'midst shades of death;",
"3": "Down from heaven's unclouded glory
God Himself the treasure brought,
Closing thus His love's sweet story
With His sweetest, deepest thought.",
"4": "Earthen vessels, marred, unsightly,
But the treasure as of old,
Fresh from glory, gleaming brightly,
Heaven's undimmed, unchanging gold.",
"5": "Vessels, broken, frail, yet bearing
Through the hungry ages on
Riches giv'n with hand unsparing-
God's great Gift, His precious Son!"}
