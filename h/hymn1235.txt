{"1": "Oh, listen to the wanderer
In whom there was a lack;
Then hearken to the song he sings
And follow in his track.",
"chorus": "Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
I'll never be the same!",
"2": "A wanderer within the world
For pleasure ever seeks;
Be it in body or in mind,
With vanity it reeks.",
"3": "For self I labored day and night,
My castles built in sand;
But, praise the Lord, He wrecked them all-
Much better things He planned.",
"4": "Once all for self-confused, alone,
How could I bear the shame?
But now within the local church
I'll never be the same.",
"5": "I am a happy member now
Within the local church.
A wanderer has found his home
And ended all his search.",
"6": "I was an individualist,
An island in myself;
But now the Lord is building me
With others in Himself.",
"7": "I'm drawn together with His own
In fellowship so sweet.
I've learned from others to receive
Of Christ whene'er we meet.",
"8": "My wanderings have really ceased-
I've found the church, God's best!
The secret of my happiness-
Enjoying God's own rest!"}
