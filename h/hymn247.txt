{"1": "Our blest Redeemer ere He breathed
His tender last farewell,
A guide, a comforter, bequeathed
With us to dwell.",
"2": "He came sweet influence to impart,
A gracious, willing guest,
While He can find one humble heart
Wherein to rest.",
"3": "And His that gentle voice we hear,
Soft as the breath of even,
That checks each fault, that calms each fear
With peace of heav'n.",
"4": "And every virtue we possess,
And every victory won,
And every thought of holiness,
Are His alone.",
"5": "Lord, in Thy purity and grace,
Our weakness pitying see;
Oh, make our heart Thy dwelling place,
And worthier Thee."}
