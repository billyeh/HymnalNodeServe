["1 He lives, the great Redeemer lives,\nWhat joy the blest assurance gives!\nAnd now, before His Father, God,\nPleads the full merits of His blood.", "2 Repeated crimes awake our fears,\nAnd Justice armed with frowns appears;\nBut in the Savior's lovely face\nSweet Mercy smiles, and all is peace.", "3 Hence, then, ye black, despairing thoughts;\nAbove our fears, above our faults,\nHis mighty intercessions rise,\nAnd guilt recedes, and terror dies.", "4 In every dark, distressful hour,\nWhen sin and Satan join their power,\nLet this dear hope repel the dart,\nThat Jesus bears us on His heart.", "5 Great Advocate, almighty Friend!\nOn Him our humble hopes depend;\nOur cause can never, never fail,\nFor Jesus pleads, and must prevail."]
