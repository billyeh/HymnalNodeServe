{"1": "We will sing to the Lord with our spirit,
We will sing to the Lord from within,
We will sing hallelujah to Jesus;
And be blent into oneness with Him.",
"2": "We have been many years in religion,
We have been many years in our mind,
We have been many years in emotions,
Always seeking, but never to find.",
"3": "Now we're learning to turn to our spirit,
Now we're learning to take Christ as life;
Now we're learning to feed upon Jesus
And be freed from all struggling and strife.",
"4": "Hallelujah for life in the Spirit,
Hallelujah for newness within.
When we turn from our mind to our spirit,
We enjoy all the riches of Him."}
