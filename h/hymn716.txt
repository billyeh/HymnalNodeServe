["1 Begone, unbelief,\nMy Savior is near,\nAnd for my relief\nWill surely appear;\nBy prayer let me wrestle,\nAnd He will perform;\nWith Christ in the vessel,\nI smile at the storm.", "2 Though dark be my way,\nSince He is my Guide,\n'Tis mine to obey,\n'Tis His to provide;\nThough cisterns be broken,\nAnd creatures all fail,\nThe word He hath spoken\nShall surely prevail.", "3 His love, in time past,\nForbids me to think\nHe'll leave me at last\nIn trouble to sink:\nEach sweet Ebenezer\nI have in review\nConfirms His good pleasure\nTo help me quite through.", "4 Why should I complain\nOf want or distress,\nTemptation or pain?\nHe told me no less;\nThe heirs of salvation,\nI know from His Word,\nThrough much tribulation\nMust follow their Lord.", "5 How bitter that cup\nNo heart can conceive,\nWhich He drank quite up,\nThat sinners might live!\nHis way was much rougher\nAnd darker than mine;\nDid Christ, my Lord, suffer,\nAnd shall I repine?", "6 Since all that I meet\nShall work for my good,\nThe bitter is sweet,\nThe medicine, food;\nThough painful at present,\n'Twill cease before long,\nAnd then, oh, how pleasant\nThe conqueror's song!"]
