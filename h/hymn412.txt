["1 Lord, reveal Thyself to me\nThat the flesh I'll fully know;\nMay Thy grace so work in me\nThat in dust I'll lowly bow.\nHow I long for victory\nYet, thru all my life, how weak!\nEvil things I cannot leave\nNor can do the good I seek.", "2 Inwardly I want the Lord\nBut my conduct hateful is;\nThough I would, I cannot change\nO what real bondage 'tis!\nBy God's law my sin's revealed\nBut the law of sin doth bind;\nThough I struggle to be free\nNo release my soul can find.", "3 Many times I fall and rise\nOft resolve, and often fail;\nCraving vict'ry, I retreat\nAnd my sad defeat bewail.\nTruly I am sold to sin,\nAnd completely powerless;\nThere's no good within my flesh\nAll is dark and sinfulness.", "4 Now I know myself in part\nAnd confess my helplessness;\nAll my temperament is odd\nAll my life corrupted is.\nSubtle self I cannot trust\nNor to fleshly strength can cling;\nAll my trust and all my hope,\nIs in Jesus Christ my King.", "5 May the Cross put me to death,\nThat on Christ I may rely;\nMay His Holy Spirit fill\nThat Himself I may apply.\nMay His death so work in me,\nDaily deeper than before\nThat my self may be destroyed,\nAnd His life thru me may pour.", "6 O how bitter is my case!\nWho this wretched slave can free\nWho deliver from this death\nTo a life of victory?\nJesus shed His blood for me\nChrist is now my holiness;\nI receive Him as my life,\nAnd my portion measureless.", "7 Now I'm wholly sanctified\nSelfless, I obey His word;\nNevermore to feel ashamed,\nWhen I come before the Lord.\nHow transcendent is this life!\nGrace thru faith He gives to me!\nPraise the Lord, He heard my cry,\nAnd has made me wholly free."]
