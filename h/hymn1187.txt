{"1": "Your ministry, O Lord,
How excellent it is;
A better covenant,
And better promises;
Enacted on a better law.
Of such You are Executor.",
"2": "A better covenant,
And better promises;
A better law of life
And sacrifice this is.
Redemption's work, done long ago,
A better blood has made it so.",
"3": "In Hebrews eight we see
The way to make us whole;
Life planted deep within,
Which spreads into the soul.
The law of life, imparted, still
Inscribed in mind, emotion, will.",
"4": "The law of letters leave,
The law of life pursue;
The one is old and dead,
The other fresh and new.
Dead teachings cannot help the seed;
The law of life is what we need.",
"5": "The law of life in us,
In function now we see,
Works not by will and thought
But automatically.
It saturates, conforms to Him;
The standard model spreads within.",
"6": "Our sins are all forgiv'n,
His life imparted too;
God is our God today,
And we're His people true.
We know Him in an inward way:
These blessings four have come to stay.",
"7": "We're being sonized now;
The life within will do
The deep transforming work
Of making us anew.
In ages past, the work was done-
Now prayer is over-praise the Son!"}
