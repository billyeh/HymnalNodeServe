{"1": "Oh, what a wonderful place
Jesus has given to me!
Saved by His glorious grace,
I may be even as He.
When with my Lord I appear,
Like Him I know I shall be;
But while I walk with Him here,
I may be even as He.",
"chorus": "Even as He, even as He,
Wonderful words that even we,
Saved by His marvelous grace may be
One with the Savior, even as He.",
"2": "One in His death on the tree,
One as He rose from the dead;
I from the curse am as free
E'en as my glorious head.
One on the throne by His side,
One in His sonship divine;
One as the Bridegroom and bride,
One as the branch and the vine.",
"3": "One in His merits I stand,
One as I pray in His name;
All that His worth can command,
I can with confidence claim.
One in His faith and His love,
One in His life I may be.
Sealed by the heavenly Dove,
I may be holy as He."}
