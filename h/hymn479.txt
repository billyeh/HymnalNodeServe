["1 Oh, what a wonderful place\nJesus has given to me!\nSaved by His glorious grace,\nI may be even as He.\nWhen with my Lord I appear,\nLike Him I know I shall be;\nBut while I walk with Him here,\nI may be even as He.", "chorus Even as He, even as He,\nWonderful words that even we,\nSaved by His marvelous grace may be\nOne with the Savior, even as He.", "2 One in His death on the tree,\nOne as He rose from the dead;\nI from the curse am as free\nE'en as my glorious head.\nOne on the throne by His side,\nOne in His sonship divine;\nOne as the Bridegroom and bride,\nOne as the branch and the vine.", "3 One in His merits I stand,\nOne as I pray in His name;\nAll that His worth can command,\nI can with confidence claim.\nOne in His faith and His love,\nOne in His life I may be.\nSealed by the heavenly Dove,\nI may be holy as He."]
