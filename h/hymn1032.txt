["1 Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched,\nWeak and wounded, sick and sore;\nJesus ready waits to save you,\nFull of pity, love and pow'r:\nHe is able, He is able,\nHe is willing, doubt no more.", "2 Come, ye needy, come and welcome;\nGod's free bounty glorify;\nTrue belief and true repentance,\nEvery grace that brings us nigh,\nWithout money, without money,\nCome to Jesus Christ and buy.", "3 Let not conscience make you linger,\nNor of fitness fondly dream;\nAll the fitness He requireth\nIs to feel your need of Him:\nThis He gives you, this He gives you,\n'Tis the Spirit's rising beam.", "4 Come, ye weary, heavy laden,\nLost and ruined by the fall;\nIf you tarry till you're better,\nYou will never come at all:\nNot the righteous, not the righteous,\nSinners Jesus came to call.", "5 Agonizing in the garden,\nYour Redeemer prostrate lies;\nOn the bloody tree behold Him!\nHear Him cry, before He dies,\n\"It is finished!\" \"It is finished!\"\nSinner, will not this suffice?", "6 Lo! th' incarnate God, ascended,\nPleads the merit of His blood;\nVenture on Him, venture wholly;\nLet no other trust intrude:\nNone but Jesus, none but Jesus,\nCan do helpless sinners good."]
