{"1": "Fainting in the desert,
Israel's thousands stand
At the rock of Kadesh.
Hark! the Lord's command,
Speak to the Rock,
Bid the waters flow,
Strike not its bosom
Opened long ago.
Speak to the Rock,
Till the waters flow.",
"chorus": "Speak to the Rock,
Bid the waters flow,
Doubt not the Spirit,
Given long ago;
Take what He waiteth,
Freely to bestow,
Drink till its fulness
All Thy being know.",
"2": "Blessed Rock of Ages,
Thou art open still;
Thy blest Holy Spirit
All our being fill;
Still Thou dost say,
Wherefore struggle so?
Call for the Spirit,
Whisper soft and low,
Speak to the Rock
Bid the waters flow.",
"3": "Oh, for trust more simple,
Fully to believe;
Oh, for hearts more childlike,
Freely to receive;
E'en as a babe,
On its mother's breast,
So on Thy bosom
Let my spirit rest,
Filled with Thy life,
With Thy blessing blest."}
