{"1": "Marching on, marching on, in the Spirit
marching on;
Hallelujah! the churches march on.
Marching on, marching on, in the Spirit
marching on;
Hallelujah! the churches march on.
In the church we see
The Lord's recovery
And for it the Spirit seven-strong.
The world will know,
Wherever we shall go,
That in our age the Lord's marching on!"}
