["1 Christ has called us once to Him,\nBut He calls us once again.\nTo His call we say Amen!\nOvercome!\nFor the church has fallen low,\nThinking everything they know,\nBut the life is missing; so,\nOvercome!", "chorus Overcome! Overcome!\nOvercome degraded Christianity!\nAll your working lay aside,\nAll the teachings that divide;\nEat the Lord whate'er betide-\nOvercome!", "2 Eating is man's destiny\nAnd the Lord's recovery;\nThis defeats the enemy-\nOvercome!\nCome enjoy the tree of life,\nLeave the doctrines, leave the strife!\nOvercome by eating Christ-\nOvercome!", "3 Teachings ne'er transform the soul,\nTeachings never reach God's goal,\nEating Christ will do it all-\nOvercome!\nWe must overcome to eat,\nBy ourselves and when we meet,\nEat Him as the feast complete-\nOvercome!", "4 Eating gives the manchild birth,\nEating brings the Lord to earth;\nEat Him now midst all the dearth-\nOvercome!\nBe the manchild Christ requires,\nThus the church that He desires,\nThen the Bride that He admires-\nOvercome!"]
