{"1": "Looking unto Jesus,
Never need we yield!
Over all the armor,
Faith the battle-shield!
Standard of salvation,
In our hearts unfurled,
Let its elevation
Overcome the world.",
"chorus": "Looking unto Jesus,
Never need we yield!
Over all the armor,
Faith the battle-shield!",
"2": "Look away to Jesus,
Look away from all!
Then we need not stumble,
Then we shall not fall.
From each snare that lureth,
Foe or phantom grim,
Safety this ensureth,
Look away to Him.",
"3": "Looking into Jesus,
Wond'ringly we trace
Heights of power and glory,
Depths of love and grace.
Vistas far unfolding
Ever stretch before,
As we gaze, beholding,
Ever more and more.",
"4": "Looking up to Jesus
On the emerald throne,
Faith shall pierce the heavens,
Where our King is gone.
Lord, on Thee depending,
Now, continually,
Heart and mind ascending,
Let us dwell with Thee."}
