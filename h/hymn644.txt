["1 Looking unto Jesus,\nNever need we yield!\nOver all the armor,\nFaith the battle-shield!\nStandard of salvation,\nIn our hearts unfurled,\nLet its elevation\nOvercome the world.", "chorus Looking unto Jesus,\nNever need we yield!\nOver all the armor,\nFaith the battle-shield!", "2 Look away to Jesus,\nLook away from all!\nThen we need not stumble,\nThen we shall not fall.\nFrom each snare that lureth,\nFoe or phantom grim,\nSafety this ensureth,\nLook away to Him.", "3 Looking into Jesus,\nWond'ringly we trace\nHeights of power and glory,\nDepths of love and grace.\nVistas far unfolding\nEver stretch before,\nAs we gaze, beholding,\nEver more and more.", "4 Looking up to Jesus\nOn the emerald throne,\nFaith shall pierce the heavens,\nWhere our King is gone.\nLord, on Thee depending,\nNow, continually,\nHeart and mind ascending,\nLet us dwell with Thee."]
