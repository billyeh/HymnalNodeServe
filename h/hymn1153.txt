{"1": "We have found the Christ who's all in all;
He is everything to us;
O how blest upon His name to call,
How divine, how glorious!",
"chorus": "It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
And the half has never yet been told!",
"2": "We have found that Christ the Spirit is
Who within our spirit dwells;
How available, how near He is,
And His sweetness all excels.",
"3": "We have found the way to live by Christ-
Pray His Word and call His name!
This-the eating, drinking-has sufficed
And its worth we now proclaim.",
"4": "We have found the local church, our home;
We are home and home indeed!
Nevermore in Babylon we roam;
In the church is all we need.",
"5": "We have found that meeting with the saints
Is the greatest joy on earth;
'Tis by this our spirit never faints
And our lives are filled with worth."}
