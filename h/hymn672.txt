["1 Not what I am, O Lord, but what Thou art;\nThat, that alone, can be my soul's true rest;\nThy love, not mine, bids fear and doubt depart,\nAnd stills the tempest of my tossing breast.", "2 It is Thy perfect love that casts out fear;\nI know the voice that speaks the It is I,\nAnd in these well-known words of heavenly cheer\nI hear the joy that bids each sorrow fly.", "3 Thy Name is Love! I hear it from yon Cross;\nThy Name is Love! I read it in yon tomb:\nAll meaner love is perishable dross,\nBut this shall light me through time's thickest gloom.", "4 It blesses now, and shall for ever bless;\nIt saves me now, and shall for ever save;\nIt holds me up in days of helplessness,\nIt bears me safely o'er each swelling wave.", "5 'Tis what I know of Thee, my Lord and God,\nThat fills my soul with peace, my lips with song;\nThou art my health, my joy, my staff, my rod;\nLeaning on Thee, in weakness I am strong.", "6 More of Thyself, Oh, show me, hour by hour;\nMore of Thy glory, O my God and Lord;\nMore of Thyself in all Thy grace and power;\nMore of Thy love and truth, Incarnate Word."]
