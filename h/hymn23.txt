According to Thy will
Eternal purpose Thou hast made,
That all Thy Son might fill.",

O who can search and trace?
Yet, Father God, in it we find,
Thy mercy and Thy grace!",

O who can know Thy mind?
All are of Thee, thru Thee, to Thee
Thy wisdom here we find.",

That mercy may be shown
That none may boast in anything,
But in Thyself alone.",

For us redemption made
That in our spirit we may have,
Thyself, the treasure, laid.",

By principalities
Thru us Thy wisdom manifold,
Shown in the heavenlies.",

In mercy we will boast
Thy wisdom will be known for aye,
Unto the uttermost."}
