["1 Majestic sweetness sits enthroned\nUpon the Savior's brow;\nHis head with radiant glories crowned,\nHis lips with grace o'erflow.", "2 No mortal can with Him compare\nAmong the sons of men;\nFairer is He than all the fair\nThat fill the heavenly train.", "3 To Him I owe my life and breath,\nAnd all the joys I have;\nHe makes me triumph over death,\nAnd saves me from the grave.", "4 To God, the Father, my abode,\nHe brings my weary feet;\nShows me the glories of my God,\nAnd makes my joys complete.", "5 Since from His bounty I receive\nSuch proofs of love divine,\nHad I a thousand hearts to give,\nLord, they should all be Thine."]
