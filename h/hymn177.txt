{"1": "Majestic sweetness sits enthroned
Upon the Savior's brow;
His head with radiant glories crowned,
His lips with grace o'erflow.",
"2": "No mortal can with Him compare
Among the sons of men;
Fairer is He than all the fair
That fill the heavenly train.",
"3": "To Him I owe my life and breath,
And all the joys I have;
He makes me triumph over death,
And saves me from the grave.",
"4": "To God, the Father, my abode,
He brings my weary feet;
Shows me the glories of my God,
And makes my joys complete.",
"5": "Since from His bounty I receive
Such proofs of love divine,
Had I a thousand hearts to give,
Lord, they should all be Thine."}
