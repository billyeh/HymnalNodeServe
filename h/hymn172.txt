["1 I cannot breathe enough of Thee,\nO gentle breeze of love;\nMore fragrant than the myrtle tree\nThe Henna-flower* is to me,\nThe Balm of Heaven above.", "2 I cannot gaze enough on Thee,\nThou Fairest of the Fair;\nMy heart is filled with ecstasy,\nAs in Thy face of radiancy\nI see such beauty there.", "3 I cannot yield enough to Thee,\nMy Savior, Master, Friend;\nI do not wish to go out free,\nBut ever, always, willingly,\nTo serve Thee to the end.", "4 I cannot sing enough of Thee,\nThe sweetest name on earth;\nA note so full of melody\nComes from my heart so joyously,\nAnd fills my soul with mirth.", "5 I cannot speak enough of Thee,\nI have so much to tell;\nThy heart it beats so tenderly\nAs Thou dost draw me close to Thee,\nAnd whisper, \"All is well.\"\nnote: \"* An Old World plant, prized for its fragrant yellow and white flowers. (Song of Sol. 1\":14, A.S.V.)"]
