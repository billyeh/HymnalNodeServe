{"1": "O how deep and how far-reaching,
Is Thy love, dear Lord, to me!
Far beyond my pow'r to fathom
Deeper than the deepest sea!
It has caused Thee death to suffer,
And to me Thyself impart
That in Thee I might be grafted,
And become of Thee a part.",
"2": "Who can tell of all the wonders,
Which Thy love for me has wrought
Yet the greatest of these wonders,
Is that Thou to me art brought.
Oh! to me Thy love has given,
All Thou art as my supply;
As true life I now may share Thee,
And Thy riches e'er enjoy.",
"3": "Lord, Thy love is the expression,
Of Thy loving self divine
Making life so full of meaning
Harmonized with God's design.
Grace of life, how all-sufficient
Is my portion day by day;
I'm the object of Thy favor,
And Thy sweetness taste alway.",
"4": "What from Thee can separate me?
Thou wilt love me to the end!
Oh! Thy love is so prevailing
E'en Thyself with me to blend!
We two one will be for ever;
I am Thine and Thou art mine!
This will be my testimony:
In Thy love we'll ever twine!"}
