{"1": "Our Lord, that One of peerless worth
Came first to die to give new birth;
He comes again to have on earth
A glorious Bride forever.",
"chorus": "Jesus! Oh, You're coming soon,
Jesus! as our dear Bridegroom;
Jesus! may our hearts make room
To be Your Bride forever.",
"2": "What our dear Lord desires the most,
Is not to just redeem the lost;
But that some saints would pay the cost,
To be His Bride forever.",
"3": "As virgins we must single be,
No other husband could have we,
That when He comes we'll then be free
To be His Bride forever.",
"4": "How could we love this fading world,
When Christ desires that one great pearl;
To Him we must our love unfurl
To bring Him back forever."}
