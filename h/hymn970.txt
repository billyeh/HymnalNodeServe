{"1": "For the glorious revelation,
Of the sons of God to come
All the creatures wait, expecting
That they all may free become.",
"2": "All creation groans together
Subject now to vanity
Looking for their full deliv'rance,
From corruption's slavery.",
"3": "Even we ourselves are groaning
Till we reach maturity;
We are growing to adoption
With Christ in conformity.",
"4": "'Tis for this the Spirit groaneth
That to Christ we be conformed;
All things also work together
That in life we be transformed.",
"5": "God will bring us into glory
We will then be glorified;
Fully saturated with Him
We'll be wholly sanctified.",
"6": "To the freedom of this glory
All creation will be freed;
With the kid shall lie the leopard
And the cow with bear shall feed.",
"7": "Heirs with Christ in full adoption
We'll His heritage possess
Glorified with Him as brethren
God's full glory we'll express."}
