["1 Cleansed in our Savior's precious blood,\nFilled with the fulness of our God,\nWalking by faith the path He trod,\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!", "2 Leaning our heads on Jesus' breast,\nKnowing the joy of that sweet rest,\nFinding in Him the chief, the best,\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!", "3 Kept by His pow'r from day to day,\nHeld by His hand, we cannot stray,\nGlory to glory all the way,\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!", "4 Living in us His own pure life,\nGiving us rest from inward strife,\nFrom strength to strength, from death to life,\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!", "5 O what a Savior we have found;\nWell may we make the world resound\nWith one continual joyous sound,\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!"]
