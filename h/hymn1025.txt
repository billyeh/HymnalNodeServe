["1 Give up the world, Christ to obtain\nHe is your heart's very need;\nWhat else can you desire or seek?\nAll things are empty indeed!", "chorus He is so rich, He is so full\nHe can fulfill all your needs!\nHe is so good, He is so sweet\nAll your desire He exceeds!", "2 Give up the world, Christ to obtain\nHe is the One you require;\nOnce you receive this glorious Christ\nNever the rest you'll desire.", "3 Though very great is all the world\nAnd very small is your heart\nYet the great world with all its wealth,\nNever can fill your small heart.", "4 If you have Christ, you have all joys;\nWithout this Christ, only pains;\nWhere there is Christ there morning is;\nWhere He is not, night remains."]
