{"1": "It was alone the Savior prayed
In dark Gethsemane;
Alone He drained the bitter cup
And suffered there for me.",
"chorus": "Alone, alone,
He bore it all alone;
He gave Himself to save His own,
He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.",
"2": "It was alone the Savior stood
In Pilate's judgment hall;
Alone the crown of thorns He wore,
Forsaken thus by all.",
"3": "Alone upon the cross He hung
That others He might save;
Forsaken then by God and man.
Alone, His life He gave.",
"4": "Can you reject such matchless love?
Can you His claim disown?
Come, give your all in gratitude,
Nor leave Him thus alone."}
