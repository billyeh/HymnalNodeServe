{"1": "Praying to express the Lord
We must not ourselves express
But let Christ reveal Himself
His desire in us impress.",
"2": "Praying to express the Lord
We must utter His intent
Quieting our human thoughts,
That with His our mind be blent.",
"3": "Praying to express the Lord
Ever looking unto Him,
As a mirror to reflect,
All His glory from within.",
"4": "Praying to express the Lord
Letting Him beseech in us;
Christ indwelling prays within,
To the Christ in heaven thus.",
"5": "Praying to express the Lord
Learning not to pray by self
Praying wholly with the Lord
Praying only by Himself."}
