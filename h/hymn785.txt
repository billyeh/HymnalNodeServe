["1 Praying to express the Lord\nWe must not ourselves express\nBut let Christ reveal Himself\nHis desire in us impress.", "2 Praying to express the Lord\nWe must utter His intent\nQuieting our human thoughts,\nThat with His our mind be blent.", "3 Praying to express the Lord\nEver looking unto Him,\nAs a mirror to reflect,\nAll His glory from within.", "4 Praying to express the Lord\nLetting Him beseech in us;\nChrist indwelling prays within,\nTo the Christ in heaven thus.", "5 Praying to express the Lord\nLearning not to pray by self\nPraying wholly with the Lord\nPraying only by Himself."]
