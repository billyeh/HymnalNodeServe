["1 There's a race for us to run-Hallelujah,\nAnd a way for us the race to win.\nTo all those who have begun-Hallelujah,\nGod has spoken, \"Look away to Him!\"", "chorus Look away! O look away!\nLook to Jesus now today!\nLook away from everything unto Jesus,\nLook away from everything to Him!", "2 Look away from all around-Hallelujah,\nLook away from all the strife and din;\nLook away where peace is found-Hallelujah,\nLook away from everything to Him.", "3 Look away from fickle soul-Hallelujah,\nLook away from failing self within;\nLook away toward the goal-Hallelujah,\nLook away from everything to Him.", "4 Look away from all the past-Hallelujah,\nLook away from both the good and sin;\nTo the living One hold fast-Hallelujah,\nLook away from everything to Him.", "5 Look away into His face-Hallelujah,\nHe who'll finish what He did begin.\nO what grace to run the race-Hallelujah-\nWe obtain by looking off to Him!"]
