{"1": ""Man shall not live by bread alone
But by each word which doth proceed,
From God's own mouth" these we must eat,
And let them be our life indeed.",
"2": "Not just a body we were made
But body, soul, and spirit too;
The inmost part the spirit is,
To contact God and Him pursue.",
"3": "Just as we need the earthly food,
Our body's need to satisfy
We need the food for spirit too-
Thyself, Thy Word, its true supply.",
"4": "Thou art the Spirit, and Thy Word,
Thy very Self expressed doth make;
Thus, it is Spirit as Thyself
Which by our spirit we must take.",
"5": "Thus, to receive Thy Word is not,
To read it only with our eyes,
And understand it in our mind
But 'tis the spirit's exercise.",
"6": "Thy Word in spirit we must eat,
And to our inmost part receive;
'Tis by our spirit's exercise,
To pray with what our minds perceive.",
"7": "Thy Word remaining in our mind,
Is only knowledge burdensome
But when it to the spirit goes,
Then life and spirit it becomes.",
"8": "'Tis only when our spirit acts,
To take Thy Word and contact Thee
We truly feed upon Thy Word,
And touch Thyself most inwardly.",
"9": "Lord, teach us how to exercise,
Our spirit when Thy Word we read;
Then will our spirit nourished be,
As thus upon Thyself we feed."}
