["1 Rescue the perishing,\nCare for the dying,\nSnatch them in pity from sin and the grave;\nWeep o'er the erring one,\nLift up the fallen,\nTell them of Jesus the mighty to save.", "chorus Rescue the perishing,\nCare for the dying;\nJesus is merciful,\nJesus will save.", "2 Though they are slighting Him,\nStill He is waiting,\nWaiting the penitent child to receive;\nPlead with them earnestly,\nPlead with them gently;\nHe will forgive if they only believe.", "3 Down in the human heart,\nCrushed by the tempter,\nFeelings lie buried that grace can restore;\nTouched by a loving heart,\nWakened by kindness,\nChords that are broken will vibrate once more.", "4 Rescue the perishing,\nDuty demands it;\nStrength for thy labor the Lord will provide;\nBack to the narrow way,\nPatiently win them;\nTell the poor wand'rer a Savior has died."]
