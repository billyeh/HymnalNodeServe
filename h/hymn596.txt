{"1": "Mine is the earth, the worlds in all their fulness;
Mine, every ocean, river, plain, and hill;
Mine are the stars within the heaven's stillness,
Mine are the clouds that wander at their will.",
"2": "Mine is the spring, when blossoms sweet are blowing,
Wakened from slumb'ring neath the winter snow;
Mine, summer's wealth, with her bright colors glowing;
Mine is the fruit rich autumn doth bestow.",
"3": "Mine, all the things created: "praise the Giver!
Fish, and all beasts, the birds upon the wing,
Sun-loving butterflies-now and forever;
Beauty and grace of every living thing.",
"4": "Mine, all things lovely, blessing every hour,
Wealth of creation, over and around;
Mine is the sun, with its life-giving power,
Mine is the music wonderful of sound.",
"5": "Mine are the pillars which cannot be shaken-
Truth in the Word, the Word that cannot fall.
Mine is the wisdom which great thoughts awaken
In a man's soul, that this life is not all.",
"6": "Knowledge as needed, skill in all the doing,
Mine, when kept closely for my Lord above;
Beauty and wisdom, living streams e'er flowing
Fresh from the springs of God, the God of love.",
"7": "Mine are the battles, triumph-shouts e'er ringing-
Joy of the warriors for the truth and right;
Mine are the trophies God's brave ones are bringing,
Heroes of faith and overcoming might.",
"8": "Mine, mercies granted, and each new awaking,
Every experience, and each soul that's won;
Mine, the confessions sinners poor are making,
Yea, I am joined with them, one in God's Son.",
"9": "One' Lord in all, and all one in His Spirit,
Heavenly fellowship earth has not known;
Faith sees the riches we shall yet inherit,
Glorious treasure laid up for His own.",
"10": "All in the bounds of earth and sea and heaven,
Creation's wonders and Thy grace are stored:
Praise to Thee, Christ, for all the wealth Thou'st given!
Poor in myself, but wealthy in my Lord!"}
