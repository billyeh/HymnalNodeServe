{"1": "Let me sing, for the glory of heaven
Like a sunbeam has swept o'er my heart;
I would praise Thee for sins all forgiven,
For Thy love, which shall never depart.",
"2": "If Thy works praise Thee, Giver of good,
If the sun shines his praise unto Thee,
If the wind, as it sighs through the wood,
Makes a murmur of song from each tree,",
"3": "Then these lips, sure, a tribute shall bring,
Though unworthy the praises must be;
Shall all nature be vocal and sing,
And no psalm of rejoicing from me?",
"4": "O wonderful, glorious Redeemer!
I would worship Thee, Savior Divine;
And rejoice, though surrounded with praises,
Thou wilt still hear a song such as mine."}
