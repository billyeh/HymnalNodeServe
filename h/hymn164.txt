["1 Let me sing, for the glory of heaven\nLike a sunbeam has swept o'er my heart;\nI would praise Thee for sins all forgiven,\nFor Thy love, which shall never depart.", "2 If Thy works praise Thee, Giver of good,\nIf the sun shines his praise unto Thee,\nIf the wind, as it sighs through the wood,\nMakes a murmur of song from each tree,", "3 Then these lips, sure, a tribute shall bring,\nThough unworthy the praises must be;\nShall all nature be vocal and sing,\nAnd no psalm of rejoicing from me?", "4 O wonderful, glorious Redeemer!\nI would worship Thee, Savior Divine;\nAnd rejoice, though surrounded with praises,\nThou wilt still hear a song such as mine."]
