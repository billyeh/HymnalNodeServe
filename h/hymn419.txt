["1 O God, unblessing and unblest,\nA withered plant, but not at rest,\nA useless cumberer I'm found\nUpon Thy field, Thy purchased ground;\nAnd yet I pray-\"Do not forsake me,\nBut in Thy hand, O Savior, take me.", "2 As women take unbroken flax,\nAs molders take unshapen wax,\nAs smith, the iron, rough and cold,\nA useful instrument to mold,\nSo in Thy skillful hands, O take me,\nAnd never let Thy love forsake me.", "3 Like rock uncrushed, the stubborn will,\nThough bearing gold is barren still;\nLike marble in the quarry rough,\nThe natural heart is useless stuff;\nAnd so, I pray-\"Do not forsake me,\nBut with Thy hand, O Savior, break me.", "4 As mortars crush the hardest rock,\nAs hammers break the stony block,\nAs millstones bruise the finest wheat,\nAs nuts are broken for their meat,\nSo with Thy mighty hand, O break me,\nAnd never let Thy love forsake me.", "5 Though crushed and broken, yet I'm nought\nBut fragments to the furnace brought;\nThough bruised, I have no worth to feed\nThe multitudes that die in need;\nAnd so, I pray-\"Do not forsake me,\nBut meet for service, Savior, make me.", "6 As into useful forms the ore\nFrom molten scraps the molders' pour;\nAs fire doth make the bruised wheat,\nWhen mixed and molded, fit to eat;\nSo, fit for use by fire, O make me,\nAnd never let Thy love forsake me.\""]
