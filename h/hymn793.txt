{"1": "My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
First let Him speak to thee, then speak to Him;
True prayer in thee the Lord initiates
Thou but a channel art expressing Him.",
"2": "My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
Learn to deny thy thought and all thy will.
Learn to let God anoint thee with Himself,
And thru thy prayer His purposes fulfill.",
"3": "My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
Silent to all thy wishes and thy plans
Silent to all thy earthly cares and calls
That God may work in thee all His demands.",
"4": "My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
Yield to the spirit all thy heart and mind;
Here let the spirit show what God reveals
Thee its obedient servant thus to find.

"5": "My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
Learn thus to let the Spirit pray thru thee;
All of thy being with the Spirit move
Thy prayer will thus God's own expression be.",
"6": "My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
Till in the spirit thou with God art one
Till thru the spirit God possesses all,
And thus transforms each part unto His Son.",
"7": "My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
Till God may freely, fully flow thru thee
Till all thy words and actions hour by hour,
Are the fulfillment of God's will thru thee."}
