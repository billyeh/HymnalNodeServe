{"1": "All Scripture is the very breath of God
And by His Spirit into words was breathed;
By godly men the words were written down
With all God's fulness unto man bequeathed.",
"2": "It is the breath of God as light to man
With rays divine man to illuminate;
It shines in darkness and to man reveals,
What is his truest need and actual state.",
"3": "It is the breath of God as life to man
Nature divine to man it doth impart;
The dead it quickens and regenerates
Transforms the soul-life and renews the heart.",
"4": "It is the breath of God as wisdom too
Knowledge divine to man it has to teach;
Th' eternal purpose of the Lord it shows
And leadeth man God's final goal to reach.",
"5": "It is the breath of God as strength to man
Power divine to man it doth transmit
Strength'ning the weak, empowering the faint
Enabling man God's purpose full to fit.",
"6": "It is the breath of God for us to breathe
That as our portion God we may enjoy;
Receiving it by spirits exercised
Our need is met, His wealth we may employ."}
