["1 All Scripture is the very breath of God\nAnd by His Spirit into words was breathed;\nBy godly men the words were written down\nWith all God's fulness unto man bequeathed.", "2 It is the breath of God as light to man\nWith rays divine man to illuminate;\nIt shines in darkness and to man reveals,\nWhat is his truest need and actual state.", "3 It is the breath of God as life to man\nNature divine to man it doth impart;\nThe dead it quickens and regenerates\nTransforms the soul-life and renews the heart.", "4 It is the breath of God as wisdom too\nKnowledge divine to man it has to teach;\nTh' eternal purpose of the Lord it shows\nAnd leadeth man God's final goal to reach.", "5 It is the breath of God as strength to man\nPower divine to man it doth transmit\nStrength'ning the weak, empowering the faint\nEnabling man God's purpose full to fit.", "6 It is the breath of God for us to breathe\nThat as our portion God we may enjoy;\nReceiving it by spirits exercised\nOur need is met, His wealth we may employ."]
