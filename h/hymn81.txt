{"1": "O Lord, Thy being is of old
Before th' eternal past began!
For Thou th' eternal Father art
The uncreated, great I AM!",
"2": "Although a man with men become
Yet Thou with God eternal art!
The same completeness Thou dost share
And infinite as God Thou art!",
"3": "Thine origin, the same as God
Before creation was decreed!
Before the foremost, Thou art first
None other doth Thyself precede!",
"4": "Thou never changest thru all time
Thy years are to eternity!
None is as lasting as Thyself
Nor is there any after Thee!",
"5": "Just as the Father, diff'ring not
The same perfection Thou too hast!
Thou art the Alpha and the First
Thou art Omega and the Last!",
"6": "We praise Thee for Thine endless years
Extol Thee for Thy perfectness!
Admiring all Thy fulness vast
We marvel at Thy boundlessness!"}
