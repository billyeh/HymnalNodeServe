["1 Lord, in Thy Spirit, take and fill my heart;\nWean it from earth, through all its pulses move;\nInto my spirit all Thy grace impart,\nAnd make me love Thee as I ought to love.", "2 I ask no dream, no prophet ecstasies,\nNo sudden rending of the veil of clay,\nNo angel visitant, no opening skies;\nBut take the dimness of my soul away.", "3 Hast Thou not bid us love Thee, God and King?\nAll, all Thine own-soul, heart and strength and mind.\nI see Thy cross-there teach my heart to cling.\nOh, let me seek Thee, and, oh, let me find.", "4 Teach me to feel that Thou art always nigh;\nTeach me the struggles of the soul to bear,\nTo check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh;\nTeach me the patience of unanswered prayer.", "5 Teach me to love Thee with a virgin love,\nOne holy passion filling all my frame;\nThus all the riches of Thyself to prove,\nMy heart an altar, and Thy love the flame."]
