{"1": "Lord, in Thy Spirit, take and fill my heart;
Wean it from earth, through all its pulses move;
Into my spirit all Thy grace impart,
And make me love Thee as I ought to love.",
"2": "I ask no dream, no prophet ecstasies,
No sudden rending of the veil of clay,
No angel visitant, no opening skies;
But take the dimness of my soul away.",
"3": "Hast Thou not bid us love Thee, God and King?
All, all Thine own-soul, heart and strength and mind.
I see Thy cross-there teach my heart to cling.
Oh, let me seek Thee, and, oh, let me find.",
"4": "Teach me to feel that Thou art always nigh;
Teach me the struggles of the soul to bear,
To check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh;
Teach me the patience of unanswered prayer.",
"5": "Teach me to love Thee with a virgin love,
One holy passion filling all my frame;
Thus all the riches of Thyself to prove,
My heart an altar, and Thy love the flame."}
