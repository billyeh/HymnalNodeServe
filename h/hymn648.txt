["1 Soldier, soldier, fighting in the world's great strife,\nOn thyself relying, battling for thy life;\nTrust thyself no longer,\nTrust to Christ-He's stronger;\nI can all things, all things do\nThrough Christ, which strengtheneth me.", "2 In your daily duty, standing up for right,\nAre you sometimes weary-heart not always light?\nDoubt your Savior never,\nThis your motto ever:\nI can all things, all things do\nThrough Christ, which strengtheneth me.", "3 If your way be weary He will help you through-\nHelp you in your troubles and your pleasures too;\nSay, when Satan's by you;\nSay, when all things try you:\nI can all things, all things do\nThrough Christ, which strengtheneth me.", "4 In a world of trouble, tempted oft to stray,\nYou need never stumble, Satan cannot stay,\nWill but tempt you vainly,\nIf you tell him plainly:\nI can all things, all things do\nThrough Christ, which strengtheneth me.", "5 Jesus' power is boundless, boundless as the sea;\nHe is always able, able to keep me,\nPower bring from my weakness,\nGlory from my meekness:\nI can all things, all things do\nThrough Christ, which strengtheneth me."]
