All for Jesus!\nOnly Jesus will I trust.", "4 Since mine eyes were fixed on Jesus,\nI've lost sight of all beside-\nSo enchained my spirit's vision,\nLooking at the Crucified.\nAll for Jesus! All for Jesus!\nLooking at the Crucified.\nAll for Jesus! All for Jesus!\nLooking at the Crucified.", "5 Oh, what wonder! how amazing!\nJesus, glorious King of kings,\nDeigns to call me His beloved,\nLets me rest beneath His wings.\nAll for Jesus! All for Jesus!\nResting now beneath His wings.\nAll for Jesus! All for Jesus!\nResting now beneath His wings."]
