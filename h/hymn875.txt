["1 'Tis easy when the morning\nAppears at last to view\nTo praise thy strong Redeemer\nWho burst the bondage through,\nBut 'tis the praise at midnight\nThat gives the foe alarm,\nThat glorifies thy Savior,\nAnd bares His strong right arm.", "2 If thou wouldst be a conqueror,\nYea, more than conqueror thou,\nIf thou wilt shout in triumph\nAnd claim the victory now;\nThe prison-doors will open,\nThe dungeon gleam with light,\nAnd sin-chained souls around thee\nShall see thy Lord's great might."]
