["1 Come into my heart, O Lord Jesus,\nCome into my heart, I pray;\nMy soul is so troubled and weary,\nCome into my heart, today.", "chorus Into my heart, into my heart,\nCome into my heart, Lord Jesus;\nCome in today, come in to stay,\nCome into my heart, Lord Jesus.", "2 Come into my heart, O Lord Jesus,\nI need Thee through life's dreary way;\nThe burden of sin is so heavy,\nCome into my heart to stay.", "3 Come into my heart, O Lord Jesus,\nNow cleanse and illumine my soul;\nFill me with Thy wonderful Spirit,\nCome in and take full control."]
