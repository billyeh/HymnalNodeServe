["1 Come and rejoice with me!\nFor once my heart was poor,\nAnd I have found a treasury\nOf love, a boundless store.", "2 Come and rejoice with me!\nI, once so sick at heart,\nHave met with One who knows my case,\nAnd knows the healing art.", "3 Come and rejoice with me!\nFor I was wearied sore,\nAnd I have found a mighty arm\nWhich holds me evermore.", "4 Come and rejoice with me!\nMy feet so wide did roam,\nAnd One has brought me from afar,\nTo find in Him my home.", "5 Come and rejoice with me!\nFor I have found a Friend\nWho knows my heart's most secret depths,\nYet loves me without end.", "6 I knew not of His love;\nAnd He had loved so long,\nWith love so faithful and so deep,\nSo tender and so strong.", "7 And now I know it all,\nHave heard and known His voice,\nAnd hear it still from day to day.\nCan I enough rejoice?"]
