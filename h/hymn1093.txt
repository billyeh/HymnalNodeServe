{"1": "Through countless ages, many men
Have longed and sought and tried to see
The secret of the universe,
So vast, so great a mystery.",
"2": "Yet not through struggling could frail man
The secret of this myst'ry find;
Nor chance, by stumbling, come upon
Such hidden things-to these he's blind.",
"3": "Behold in heav'n a throne is set,
And One upon the throne revealed;
And held in His right hand a scroll-
The mystery is tightly sealed.",
"4": "Through all the universe, a cry-
'Can one be found of such great worth
The scroll to take?' ... yet no reply,
From heav'n, below, or on the earth.",
"5": "Were it a matter now for man
By chance, or some ability,
Then surely one would now step forth
To open God's economy.",
"6": "Yet sad and solemn was that sight.
John wept as then he looked around;
And we, too, still might weeping be
If none at all were worthy found.",
"7": "But then the angel said, 'Weep not!
Behold, the Lion has prevailed
To take the scroll and loose its seals;
He has the mystery now unveiled!'",
"8": "So, John looked up the Lion to see,
But, lo, he then beheld a Lamb;
Christ both o'ercame the enemy,
And wrought redemption's work for man.",
"9": "The angels fall before His throne,
Four living creatures offer praise,
All glory to the Lion-Lamb;
Let us with theirs our voices raise!"}
