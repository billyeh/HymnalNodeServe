{"1": "Not of letters, but of spirit
The New Testamental way;
For 'tis life the spirit giveth
But the letters always slay.
Outward work God never reckons
But what's from the inmost part;
It is not to serve in letter
But life's newness to impart.",
"2": "Not just by the outward teachings
But by His anointing moved;
Not just by the outward pattern
But by inward vision proved.
Not by human rules or rituals
But by heaven's rule within;
Not by human-made decisions
But by guidance giv'n of Him.",
"3": "Not a dead religion serving
But in Christ as life to live;
Not theology dispensing
But a living Christ to give.
Not the knowledge of mere doctrine
But the message Christ should be;
Not the gifts, the forms, the teachings
But God's Christ-reality.",
"4": "Not objectively to worship
But to serve Him inwardly;
Not to preach a Christ objective
But Himself subjectively.
Not just by the Scripture serving
But in spirit and in life;
Not by flesh, but by the Spirit,
Filling, freeing from all strife."}
