{"1": "There is One amid all changes
Who standeth ever fast,
One who covers all the future,
The present and the past;
It is Christ the Rock of Ages,
The first and the last,
The first and the last.",
"chorus": "Jesus is the first,
Jesus is the last,
Trust Him for thy future,
Leave with Him the past;
Jesus is the first,
Jesus is the last,
Christ the Rock of Ages,
The first and the last.",
"2": "There is One whose arms upholdeth
This whole creation vast,
Yet He bids us on His bosom
Our cares and sorrows cast;
Let us bring them all to Jesus,
The first and the last,
The first and the last.",
"3": "There is One whose love has kept us
Through every stormy blast,
And His hand will guard and guide us
Till all the storms are past;
Jesus, we will trust Thee ever,
The first and the last,
The first and the last.",
"4": "First and last, O Christ, we crown Thee,
Our fondest love Thou hast;
Lord of lords, before Thy footstool
Let every crown be cast;
Haste the day when all shall crown Thee,
The first and the last,
The first and the last."}
