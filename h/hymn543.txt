{"1": "I give my heart to Thee,
O Jesus most desired;
And heart for heart the gift shall be,
For Thou my heart hast fired.",
"2": "Thou hearts alone wouldst move,
Thou only hearts dost love;
I would love Thee as Thou lov'st me,
O Jesus most desired.",
"3": "What off'ring can I make,
Dear Lord, to love like Thine;
That Thou, the Word, didst stoop to take
A human form like mine?",
"4": ""Give Me thy heart, my son":
Lord, Thou my heart hast won;
I would love Thee as Thou lov'st me,
O Jesus most desired.",
"5": "Thy heart is opened wide,
Its offered love most free,
That heart to heart I may abide,
And hide myself in Thee.",
"6": "Ah, how Thy love doth burn,
Till I that love return!
I would love Thee as Thou lov'st me,
O Jesus most desired.",
"7": "Here finds my heart its rest,
Repose that knows no shock,
The strength of love that keeps it blest
In Thee, the riven Rock.",
"8": "My heart, as girt around,
Her citadel hath found;
I would love Thee as Thou lov'st me,
O Jesus most desired."}
