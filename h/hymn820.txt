{"1": "Riches of Christ we should enjoy,
And then His fulness we will be;
Partaking of His very self
His testimony men will see.",
"2": "Riches of Christ are what He is,
To us who are His members true;
His fulness is what we become,
As body doth to man accrue.",
"3": "Riches of Christ are typified,
By Canaan's produce rich and sweet
With which the temple great was built
The Church's greatest type replete.",
"4": "As Eve to Adam fulness was
So is the Church to Christ her Head;
As Eve from Adam's being came
The Church by Christ's own life is bred.",
"5": "Christ's riches are Himself within
His fulness is the Church without
As His expression, full of Him;
The Church with Christ is built throughout."}
