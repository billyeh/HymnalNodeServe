{"1": "In the hour of trial,
Jesus, plead for me,
Lest by base denial,
I depart from Thee;
When Thou seest me waver,
With a look recall,
Nor for fear or favor
Suffer me to fall.",
"2": "Should Thy mercy send me
Sorrow, toil, and woe;
Or should pain attend me
On my path below;
Grant that I may never
Fail Thy hand to see;
Grant that I may ever
Cast my care on Thee.",
"3": "When the last hour cometh,
Fraught with strife and pain,
When Thou, Lord, returneth
To the earth again;
On Thy truth relying
As that hour draws near,
Jesus, take me, waiting,
To Thy presence dear."}
