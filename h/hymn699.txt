["1 In the hour of trial,\nJesus, plead for me,\nLest by base denial,\nI depart from Thee;\nWhen Thou seest me waver,\nWith a look recall,\nNor for fear or favor\nSuffer me to fall.", "2 Should Thy mercy send me\nSorrow, toil, and woe;\nOr should pain attend me\nOn my path below;\nGrant that I may never\nFail Thy hand to see;\nGrant that I may ever\nCast my care on Thee.", "3 When the last hour cometh,\nFraught with strife and pain,\nWhen Thou, Lord, returneth\nTo the earth again;\nOn Thy truth relying\nAs that hour draws near,\nJesus, take me, waiting,\nTo Thy presence dear."]
