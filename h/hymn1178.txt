["1 We have seen Christ is reality:\nBut it's not sufficient just to see:\nHe in our experience must be\nEverything to us.\nWe in prayer behold Him face to face,\nIn the Word and meetings know His grace;\nBut in daily life, in every place,\nWhat is He to us?\nHallelujah! By His light we see\nOh, how real, how full our Lord will be\nIf we'll only turn to Him at every time,\nin every day,\nEvery thing, in every way and-\nBe specific for reality!\nAnd be done with generality!\nIf we'll just apply Him, we will see\nHe's everything to us.", "2 Life is full of opportunities\nOrdered by our Father's hand: \"we see\nEverything's the best that it could be,\nSo let's gain Christ!\nChrist our content and reality\nTo shine out from us unceasingly:\nHe must have a way in you and me,\nHe must have a way.\nHallelujah! In the body we\nBear the death of Christ continually:\nThus His life comes forth for all to see as\nThe outer man is broken down,\nThe inner man is shining so that-\nIn these earthen vessels men can see\nThere's the treasure of reality!\nThus the gospel's glorious light will be\nShining out from us.", "chorus Not just doctrines and theology,\nBut the content of reality:\nChrist as everything in you and me,\nHe's everything to us!"]
