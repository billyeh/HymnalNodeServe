{"1": "O living Word of God, God's image true
Thou art the content of God's written word;
God in Thee we have met, God's fulness found
And in the Scripture we Thyself have heard.",
"2": "No man has e'er seen God, apart from Thee
Without the Scripture Thee we'd hardly see;
Thou to the human race God hast declared
And thru the Scripture Thou art shown to me.",
"3": "Perfect embodiment Thou art of God
A portrait full the Scripture gives of Thee;
In Thee we comprehend God's image true
And thru the Scripture Thou art real to me.",
"4": "Life-giving Spirit Thou, as well as Word
Now e'en the Spirit in the Word Thou art;
When thru the Spirit giv'n, I touch the Word
Fulness divine to me Thou dost impart.",
"5": "In Thee I may with God have fellowship
And thru the Scripture I on Thee may feed;
Thru study of the Word with prayer to God,
Thy glorious riches fully meet my need.",
"6": "Teach me to exercise my spirit, Lord
Thy Word to study, so to contact Thee
That Thou, the living Word, with Scripture, too
As one my daily manna e'er may be."}
