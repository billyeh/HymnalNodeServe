{"1": "Fight the battle in the Body
Never fight it on your own;
With the Body to the Head joined
Fight the battle on the throne.",
"chorus": "Fight the battle in the Body!
By the virtue of the Head;
Standing firmly with the Body
Into vict'ry you'll be led.",
"2": "For the Body is God's armor
Not for anyone alone;
When you wrestle in the Body
All its benefits you own.",
"3": "'Tis the Church on Christ established,
Satan shall not overpow'r;
'Tis the Body built together,
Which resists the evil pow'r.",
"4": "In the Body, by the Headship
Sitting in the heavenlies
Struggle with the wicked spirits,
And the principalities.",
"5": "As a member of the Body
With the brethren stand for God;
Praying always in the Spirit
Claim the vict'ry through the Blood.",
"6": "In the heav'nlies more than conqu'ror
In the power of His might
As a soldier in the army
In the Lord the battle fight.",
"7": "Keep on wrestling in the Body
Mighty vict'ry you will see
Bind and loose, God's will fulfilling
And the foes your food will be."}
