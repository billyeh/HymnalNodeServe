["1 At even when the sun was set,\nThe sick, O Lord, around Thee lay;\nO in what divers pains they met!\nO with what joy they went away!", "2 Once more 'tis eventide, and we\nOppressed with various ills draw near;\nWhat if Thy form we cannot see?\nWe know and feel that Thou art here.", "3 O Savior Christ, our woes dispel;\nFor some are sick, and some are sad,\nAnd some have never loved Thee well\nAnd some have lost the love they had;", "4 *And some have found the world is vain,\nYet from the world they break not free;\nAnd some have friends who give them pain,\nYet have not sought a friend in Thee;", "5 *And none, O Lord, have perfect rest,\nFor none are wholly free from sin;\nAnd they who fain would serve Thee best\nAre conscious most of wrong within.", "6 O Savior Christ, Thou too art Man;\nThou hast been troubled, tempted, tried;\nThy kind but searching glance can scan\nThe very wounds that shame would hide.", "7 Thy touch has still its ancient power;\nNo word from Thee can fruitless fall;\nHear in this solemn evening hour,\nAnd in Thy mercy heal us all.\nnote: \"Vv. 4 and 5 may be omitted if hymn is sung for physical healing."]
