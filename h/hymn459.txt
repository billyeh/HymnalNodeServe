{"1": "Not to ourselves again,
Not to the flesh we live;
Not to the world henceforth shall we
Our strength, our being give.",
"2": "The time past of our lives
Sufficeth to have wrought
The fleshly will, which only ill
Hath to us ever brought.",
"3": "No longer is our life
A thing unused or vain;
To us e'en here to live is Christ,
To us to die is gain.",
"4": "Our life is hid with Christ,
With Christ in God above,
Upward our heart would go to Him,
Whom, seeing not, we love.",
"5": "He liveth, and we live!
His life for us prevails;
His fulness fills our mighty void,
His strength for us avails."}
