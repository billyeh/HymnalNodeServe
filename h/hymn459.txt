["1 Not to ourselves again,\nNot to the flesh we live;\nNot to the world henceforth shall we\nOur strength, our being give.", "2 The time past of our lives\nSufficeth to have wrought\nThe fleshly will, which only ill\nHath to us ever brought.", "3 No longer is our life\nA thing unused or vain;\nTo us e'en here to live is Christ,\nTo us to die is gain.", "4 Our life is hid with Christ,\nWith Christ in God above,\nUpward our heart would go to Him,\nWhom, seeing not, we love.", "5 He liveth, and we live!\nHis life for us prevails;\nHis fulness fills our mighty void,\nHis strength for us avails."]
