{"1": "O come, all ye faithful! joyfully triumphant,
To Bethlehem hasten now with glad accord;
Lo! in a manger lies the God Almighty;",
"chorus": "O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord!",
"2": "Raise, raise choirs of angels, songs of loudest triumph,
Through heaven's high arches be your praises poured:
Now to our God be glory in the highest;",
"3": "Amen! Lord, we bless Thee, born for our salvation!
O Jesus! forever be Thy Name adored;
Word of the Father, late in flesh appearing;"}
