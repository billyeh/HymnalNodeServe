{"1": "Jesus is our lovely Bridegroom,
And our Bridegroom is with us!
Now our praying's turned to praising
In His Presence glorious.",
"chorus": "O our Bridegroom! O our Bridegroom!
Lord, Thou art our Bridegroom sweet!
How we treasure Thy dear presence-
O what bliss and joy complete!",
"2": "We are fellows of the Bridegroom
And our fasting days have ceased.
With the Bridegroom in His chamber,
Joyfully we keep the feast.",
"3": "We as virgins may enjoy Him,
Virgins simple, single, chaste.
Going forth to meet the Bridegroom,
Out from all the world we haste.",
"4": "We are guests by God invited
To His Son's great wedding feast.
Brothers, sisters, hallelujah,
From religion we're released!",
"5": "Now rejoice with joy excelling,
Joy of joys, all else beside-
Not just fellows, guests, or virgins,
Hallelujah, we're the Bride!",
"chorus": "Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Lord, Thou art our Bridegroom sweet!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
O what bliss and joy complete!"}
