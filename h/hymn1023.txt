{"1": "I need Thee, precious Jesus!
For I am full of sin;
My soul is dark and guilty,
My spirit dead within:
I need the cleansing fountain,
Where I can always flee:
The blood of Christ most precious,
The sinner's perfect plea.",
"2": "I need Thee, precious Jesus!
For I am very poor;
A stranger and a pilgrim,
I have no earthly store:
I need the love of Jesus,
To cheer me on my way,
To guide my doubting footsteps,
To be my strength and stay.",
"3": "I need Thee, precious Jesus!
I need a friend like Thee;
A friend to soothe and comfort,
A friend to care for me:
I need the heart of Jesus,
To feel each anxious care,
To bear my every burden,
And all my sorrow share.",
"4": "I need Thee, precious Jesus!
I need Thee day by day,
To fill me with Thy fulness,
To lead me on my way;
I need Thy Holy Spirit,
To teach me what I am;
To show me more of Jesus,
To point me to the Lamb.",
"5": "I need Thee, precious Jesus!
And hope to see Thee soon,
Encircled with Thy glory,
And seated on Thy throne;
There with Thy blood-bought people,
My joy shall ever be
To praise Thee, precious Jesus,
To gaze, my Lord, on Thee."}
