["1 Keep up the song of faith,\nHowever dark the night;\nAnd as you praise, the Lord will work\nTo change your faith to sight.", "2 Keep up the song of faith,\nAnd let your heart be strong,\nFor God delights when faith can praise\nThough dark the night and long.", "3 Keep up the song of faith,\nThe foe will hear and flee;\nOh, let not Satan hush your song,\nFor praise is victory.", "4 Keep up the song of faith,\nThe dawn will break ere long,\nAnd we shall go to meet the Lord,\nAnd join the endless song.\nnote: \"(Repeat the last line of each stanza)"]
