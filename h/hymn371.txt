Can peace afford.",

Every hour I need Thee;
Oh, bless me now, my Savior!
I come to Thee.",

Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh.",

In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,

Teach me Thy will;
And Thy rich promises
In me fulfill.",

Most Holy One;
Oh, make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son."}
