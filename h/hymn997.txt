["1 I hear the Savior say,\n\"Thy strength indeed is small,\nChild of weakness, watch and pray,\nFind in Me thine all in all.\"", "chorus Jesus paid it all,\nAll to Him I owe;\nSin had left a crimson stain,\nHe washed it white as snow.", "2 Lord, now indeed I find\nThy pow'r, and Thine alone,\nCan change the leper's spots,\nAnd melt the heart of stone.", "3 For nothing good have I\nWhereby Thy grace to claim-\nI'll wash my garments white\nIn the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.", "4 And when, before the throne,\nI stand in Him complete,\n\"Jesus died my soul to save,\nMy lips shall still repeat."]
