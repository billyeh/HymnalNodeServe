{"1": "No blood, no altar now,
The sacrifice is o'er!
No flame, no smoke ascends on high,
The lamb is slain no more,
But richer blood has flowed from nobler veins,
To purge the soul from guilt, and cleanse the reddest stains.",
"2": "We thank Thee for the blood,
The blood of Christ, God's Son
The blood by which our peace is made,
Redemption great is won,
Delivering us from hell, and sin, and woe;
That His eternal life God may to us bestow."}
