{"1": "Praise the Lord, we're in the Lord's recovery-
Home at last, here in the church.
Praise the Lord, we're in the new creation-
One new man, the end of our search.
With the saints, builded, coordinated;
No more I, forever "we."
We are one in the Son, standing here till He comes;
Yes, nothing can stop our God till He's done!"}
