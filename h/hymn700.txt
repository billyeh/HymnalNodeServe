{"1": ""Be not anxious for the morrow,
Jesus said;
Why should we its trials borrow?
Trust instead!
For each hour of need or sorrow,
Grace He gives, and daily bread.",
"2": "Thus our treasures safe investing
In His care,
Kept in His pavilion resting,
May we dare
Still to trust, thru faith's deep testing,
Sure, God will His ways declare."}
