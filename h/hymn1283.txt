{"1": "Fight, saints, for Jesus our Lord!
Take in His life, stand in one accord!
Never fear God's enemy;
Tread on his head triumphantly!
Pray that the daily church life be strong,
That all the saints in spirit press on,
Fighting as the one new man,
Fulfilling our Lord's great plan!
(Glory! Hallelujah!)"}
