["1 Pure myrrh and cinnamon,\nCalamus and cassia-\nThese are Thy elements,\nJesus my Lord!\nIn olive oil they're blent\nIn wondrous measurement-\nO what an ointment this,\nAnointing us!\nFour-in-one mingled,\nCompounded Spirit,\nSweet with Christ's suffering death,\nFull of the fragrance\nOf resurrection-\nO what an ointment flows\nIn spirit, Lord!", "2 Stacte and onycha,\nGalbanum and frankincense-\nThese are Thy elements,\nJesus my Lord!\nStacte doth sons produce,\nOnycha from sin doth loose,\nGalbanum all death repels,\nIn spirit, Lord.\nEqual proportion,\nIn resurrection;\nSeasoned with salt are they.\nGround into powder fine,\nConsumed with fire divine-\nO what an incense this,\nJesus my Lord!", "3 Ointment is Christ for us,\nExceeding glorious!\nIncense is Christ for God,\nWholly for Him.\nOintment flows down to us,\nChrist is our portion thus;\nIncense ascends to God,\nFragrant to Him.\n'Tis by th' anointing\nChrist we experience\nAnd then the incense burn.\nChrist in our prayer and praise-\nO what a Christ we raise\nFrom our experience,\nPrecious to God."]
