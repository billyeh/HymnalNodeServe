{"1": "Pure myrrh and cinnamon,
Calamus and cassia-
These are Thy elements,
Jesus my Lord!
In olive oil they're blent
In wondrous measurement-
O what an ointment this,
Anointing us!
Four-in-one mingled,
Compounded Spirit,
Sweet with Christ's suffering death,
Full of the fragrance
Of resurrection-
O what an ointment flows
In spirit, Lord!",
"2": "Stacte and onycha,
Galbanum and frankincense-
These are Thy elements,
Jesus my Lord!
Stacte doth sons produce,
Onycha from sin doth loose,
Galbanum all death repels,
In spirit, Lord.
Equal proportion,
In resurrection;
Seasoned with salt are they.
Ground into powder fine,
Consumed with fire divine-
O what an incense this,
Jesus my Lord!",
"3": "Ointment is Christ for us,
Exceeding glorious!
Incense is Christ for God,
Wholly for Him.
Ointment flows down to us,
Christ is our portion thus;
Incense ascends to God,
Fragrant to Him.
'Tis by th' anointing
Christ we experience
And then the incense burn.
Christ in our prayer and praise-
O what a Christ we raise
From our experience,
Precious to God."}
