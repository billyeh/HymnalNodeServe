["1 Thou sweet, beloved will of God,\nMy anchor ground, my fortress hill,\nMy spirit's silent, fair abode,\nIn Thee I hide me and am still.", "2 O Will, that willest good alone,\nLead Thou the way, Thou guidest best;\nA little child, I follow on,\nAnd, trusting, lean upon Thy breast.", "3 God's will doth make the bitter sweet,\nAnd all is well when it is done;\nUnless His will doth hallow it,\nThe glory of all joy is gone.", "4 Thy beautiful sweet will, my God,\nHolds fast in its sublime embrace\nMy captive will, a gladsome bird,\nPrisoned in such a realm of grace.", "5 Within this place of certain good\nLove evermore expands her wings,\nOr nestling in Thy perfect choice,\nAbides content with what it brings.", "6 Oh, lightest burden, sweetest yoke;\nIt lifts, it bears my happy soul,\nIt giveth wings to this poor heart;\nMy freedom is Thy grand control.", "7 Upon God's will I lay me down,\nAs child upon its mother's breast;\nNo silken couch, nor softest bed,\nCould ever give me such deep rest.", "8 Thy wonderful grand will, my God,\nWith triumph now I make it mine;\nAnd faith shall cry a joyous Yes\nTo every dear command of Thine."]
