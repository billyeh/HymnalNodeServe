{"1": "None other Lamb, none other Name,
None other hope in heav'n or earth or sea,
None other hiding-place from guilt and shame,
None beside Thee.",
"2": "My faith burns low, my hope burns low;
Only my heart's desire cries out in me
By the deep thunder of its want and woe,
Cries out to Thee.",
"3": "Lord, Thou art Life, though I be dead;
Love's fire Thou art, however cold I be;
Nor heaven have I, nor place to lay my head,
Nor home but Thee."}
