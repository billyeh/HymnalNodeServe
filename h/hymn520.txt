["1 None other Lamb, none other Name,\nNone other hope in heav'n or earth or sea,\nNone other hiding-place from guilt and shame,\nNone beside Thee.", "2 My faith burns low, my hope burns low;\nOnly my heart's desire cries out in me\nBy the deep thunder of its want and woe,\nCries out to Thee.", "3 Lord, Thou art Life, though I be dead;\nLove's fire Thou art, however cold I be;\nNor heaven have I, nor place to lay my head,\nNor home but Thee."]
