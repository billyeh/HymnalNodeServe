["1 O Master, let me walk with Thee\nIn lowly paths of service free;\nTell me Thy secret, help me bear\nThe strain of toil, the fret of care.", "2 Help me the slow of heart to move\nBy some clear, winning word of love;\nTeach me the wayward feet to stay,\nAnd guide them in the Godward way.", "3 Teach me Thy patience; still with Thee\nIn closer, dearer company,\nIn work that keeps faith sweet and strong,\nIn trust that triumphs over wrong.", "4 In hope that sends a shining ray\nFar down the future's broad'ning way,\nIn peace that only Thou canst give,\nWith Thee, O Master, let me live."]
