["1 My wandering days grew increasingly empty\nAs I searched for the way,\nJust to fill this gap inside me-\nFound my seeking vain.\nThough all this dark earth would convince me\nlife's worthwhile,\nInside all my mirth\nWas a cry for something real.\nDon't you lie to me, world!", "chorus For my heart tells me different\nWhen I hear of contentment\nDeep within a lack knew better\nWhy not be honest, world.", "2 A flood of strong doubt as I heard the old story\nOf a man they called Lord;\nYet my heart ne'er ceased to wonder,\nIs He really Lord?\nA search in His Word found my hardened\nheart softened,\nAnd earth's vanities faded.\nIn the brightness of His presence\nJesus came into me.", "chorus Now we're always together\nGrowing into God's fullness.\nO Lord Jesus, how I love You!\nYou brought life into me."]
