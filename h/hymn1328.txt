{"1": "My wandering days grew increasingly empty
As I searched for the way,
Just to fill this gap inside me-
Found my seeking vain.
Though all this dark earth would convince me
life's worthwhile,
Inside all my mirth
Was a cry for something real.
Don't you lie to me, world!",
"chorus": "For my heart tells me different
When I hear of contentment
Deep within a lack knew better
Why not be honest, world.",
"2": "A flood of strong doubt as I heard the old story
Of a man they called Lord;
Yet my heart ne'er ceased to wonder,
Is He really Lord?
A search in His Word found my hardened
heart softened,
And earth's vanities faded.
In the brightness of His presence
Jesus came into me.",
"chorus": "Now we're always together
Growing into God's fullness.
O Lord Jesus, how I love You!
You brought life into me."}
