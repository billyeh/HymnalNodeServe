{"1": "We are the Hebrews! Praise the Lord!
We're from the other side.
Throughout our hist'ry we have passed
Through rivers deep and wide.",

He has brought
All us river-crossing Hebrews
To the land, to build up
The temple of our God.",
"2": "Old Noah's age was so corrupt,
In deep depravity;
So Noah passed across the flood-
That separating sea.",

From the old
To a new recovered region
Where he built in this land
An altar for his God.",
"3": "Then Abraham was called apart,
For Godto take a stand;
So through the river he was led
Into a new, good land.",
"chorus": "Step by step he was led
From Chaldee
Through the river into Canaan,
That good land, there to be
The servant of his God.",
"4": "The Israelites in bondage were
To Pharaoh's choking hand.
The God of Hebrews made a way
For them to leave that land.",
"chorus": "Through the sea, they all passed;
Egypt fell,
Hallelujah! In the good land
They built up God's own house
To satisfy His heart.",
"5": "Then wand'ring through the wilderness,
The land they could not find;
Till through the Jordan they did pass
To leave themselves behind.",
"chorus": "Praise the Lord! In the land
They built up
God's own temple. Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord! There they dwelt,
His people and their God.",
"6": "But then religion conquered all,
So John the Baptist came
And buried all beneath that flood.
The Jews were not the same.",
"chorus": "Buried all! Buried all!
Buried all!
Underneath the Jordan River
Buried all to become
The Hebrews passing through.",
"7": "Now in the church life, we have left
The world, religion too;
Now we're the river-crossing ones,
Enjoying Christ so new!",
"chorus": "Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
We have passed
From the oldness, Hallelujah,
Into Christ-one new man.
And now we're one with Him!",
"8": "O Lord, You've taken us across
The fiery sea of glass,
With all the worldly things beneath;
Across the sea we've passed.",
"chorus": "Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
Now we stand
As the Hebrews, Hallelujah,
On the sea! Praise the Lord!
We've passed through everything!"}
