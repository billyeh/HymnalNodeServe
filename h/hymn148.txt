{"1": "Lord, the King of kings art Thou
In Thy presence here we bow;
God's anointed we adore
Worship Thee in holy awe.
Unto Thee, of kings the King
All the saints Thy praises sing!",
"2": "Thine authority and pow'r,
Shall prevail from shore to shore!
All shall serve and worship Thee,
In Thy kingly majesty!
Unto Thee, of kings the King
All Thy praise shall ever ring!",
"3": "Lord, Thy kingdom stands alone
And forever is Thy throne!
To Thy glory and Thy pow'r,
We will sing forevermore!
Now to Thee, of kings the King
All the saints Thy praises sing!",
"4": "Gracious Lord, our sovereign King
Thy dear name we love to sing!
O how sweet Thy reign and rule.
May Thy kingdom come in full!
Yet to Thee, of kings the King,
Here Thy praise we gladly sing!"}
