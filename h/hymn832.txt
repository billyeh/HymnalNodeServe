{"1": "Christ the Son of God and His redemptive deed,
Are the saving faith which is our only creed.
All the other doctrines do not faith comprise;
Christ, His work and person, only qualifies.",
"2": "All the other teachings used improperly,
Are the "winds of doctrine, spoiling unity:
Blowing saints away from Christ who is the Head
Building not the Body, tearing down instead.",
"3": "Thus we must relinquish doctrines of all kinds
Only keep the faith that oneness we may find.
In the Lord the Spirit we are one indeed;
Just to keep this oneness is our only need.",
"4": "Truth we must be holding, which is Christ Himself
That we be delivered from the sects of self
That in all things growing into Christ the Head
Built will be the Body and to fulness led.",
"5": "To the "unity of faith" we must attain
All the "winds of doctrine" evermore disdain;
Holding Christ the Spirit, our reality
For the Body's growing in its unity."}
