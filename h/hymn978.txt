{"1": "In new heaven and new earth,
New Jerusalem lies;
Out of God it has its birth
With God's radiance thrice.",
"chorus": "Lo, God's image it doth bear
And God's glory it doth share!
And the Lord Himself is there,
In that city of God.",
"2": "All the gates are pearls assigned,
In the city of gold
And the street is gold refined,
With foundations twelvefold.",
"3": "There life's crystal river flows,
With abundant supplies
And the tree of life there grows,
And all need satisfies.",
"4": "God is there the great I AM,
In that city of light;
God's the light within the Lamb
And there never is night."}
