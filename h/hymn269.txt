{"1": "O Lord, with Thy Holy Ghost,
Fill me to the uttermost;
Let my life Thy channel be,
Just a channel, Lord, for Thee;
Through me all Thy riches pour,
Give me ever more and more.",
"2": "O Lord, with Thy Holy Ghost,
Fill me to the uttermost;
Be it unto me, O Lord,
Now, according to Thy word;
Let the life of Jesus be,
Ever filling, even me.",
"3": "O Lord, with Thy Holy Ghost,
Fill me to the uttermost;
Cleansed and holy, pure and clean,
Let the life of Christ be seen;
Hold o'er me Thy gracious sway,
Every hour of every day.",
"4": "O Lord, with Thy Holy Ghost,
Fill me to the uttermost;
For Thy love, Thy light, Thy grace,
Just a channel all my days;
Till my Savior's face I see,
Fill me, Lord, fill even me."}
