["1 In Eden's garden, Satan thought\nHe'd wreck the Lord's intention.\nAnd so, conspiring, then, he wrought\nHis subtle intervention.\nTo man he entered in,\nBecame indwelling sin,\nAnd by this deed so bad\nHe really thought he had\nUndone the Lord completely.", "2 'Twas all according to God's plan\nTo trap the Devil, Satan.\nHis sphere of moving narrowed now,\nMan's flesh his habitation;\nThough brilliant was his plan\nTo enter into man,\nThis man became instead\nThe means to bruise his head,\nAnd finish him forever.", "3 So Christ put on our human flesh-\nAn act of wisdom purely.\nAnd on the cross did thus enmesh\nHis foe held so securely.\nThough desperate Satan's plight-\nHe fought with all his might;\nBut when the morning came\nChrist was alive again,\nAnd Satan crushed forever."]
