{"1": "In Eden's garden, Satan thought
He'd wreck the Lord's intention.
And so, conspiring, then, he wrought
His subtle intervention.
To man he entered in,
Became indwelling sin,
And by this deed so bad
He really thought he had
Undone the Lord completely.",
"2": "'Twas all according to God's plan
To trap the Devil, Satan.
His sphere of moving narrowed now,
Man's flesh his habitation;
Though brilliant was his plan
To enter into man,
This man became instead
The means to bruise his head,
And finish him forever.",
"3": "So Christ put on our human flesh-
An act of wisdom purely.
And on the cross did thus enmesh
His foe held so securely.
Though desperate Satan's plight-
He fought with all his might;
But when the morning came
Christ was alive again,
And Satan crushed forever."}
