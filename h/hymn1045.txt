{"1": "O do not let the Word depart,
And close thine eyes against the light:
Poor sinner, harden not your heart,
Be saved, O tonight.",
"chorus": "O why not tonight?
O why not tonight?
Wilt thou be saved?
Then why not tonight?",
"2": "Tomorrow's sun may never rise
To bless thy long-deluded sight;
This is the time, O then be wise,
Be saved, O tonight.",
"3": "Our Lord in pity lingers still,
And wilt thou thus His love requite?
Renounce at once thy stubborn will,
Be saved, O tonight.",
"4": "Our blessed Lord refuses none
Who would to Him their souls unite;
Believe on Him, the work is done.
Be saved, O tonight."}
