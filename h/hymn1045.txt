["1 O do not let the Word depart,\nAnd close thine eyes against the light:\nPoor sinner, harden not your heart,\nBe saved, O tonight.", "chorus O why not tonight?\nO why not tonight?\nWilt thou be saved?\nThen why not tonight?", "2 Tomorrow's sun may never rise\nTo bless thy long-deluded sight;\nThis is the time, O then be wise,\nBe saved, O tonight.", "3 Our Lord in pity lingers still,\nAnd wilt thou thus His love requite?\nRenounce at once thy stubborn will,\nBe saved, O tonight.", "4 Our blessed Lord refuses none\nWho would to Him their souls unite;\nBelieve on Him, the work is done.\nBe saved, O tonight."]
