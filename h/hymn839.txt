{"1": "Lord, Thou art a potter skilled,
And a glorious builder too
Molding for Thy vessel great
Building with Thy house in view.
I am both a man of clay,
And a new-made living stone
That Thy vessel I may be,
And the temple Thou wouldst own.",
"2": "Though of clay Thou madest us
Thou wouldst have us be transformed;
With Thy life as purest gold
Unto precious stones conformed.
We shall, through Thy building work
Then become Thy loving Bride
In one Body joined to Thee
That Thy heart be satisfied.",
"3": "What Thy heart desires and loves,
Are not precious stones alone
But together these to build,
For Thy glory, for Thy home.
Thou, the all-inclusive Christ
Dost a builded Church require
That Thy glorious riches may,
Radiate their light entire.",
"4": "Not the person spiritual,
In an individual way
But the corporate life expressed,
Will Thy heart's desire display.
Members separate and detached,
Ne'er express Thee perfectly
But Thy Body tempered, built
Ever shall Thy fulness be.",
"5": "Build me, Lord, with other saints
Independence ne'er allow
But according to Thy plan,
Fitly frame and join me now.
In experience not my boast
Nor in gifts would be my pride;
For Thy building I give all
That Thou may be glorified."}
