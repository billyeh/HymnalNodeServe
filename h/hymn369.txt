["1 Let me love Thee, Thou art claiming\nEvery feeling of my soul;\nLet that love in pow'r prevailing,\nRender Thee my life, my all;\nFor life's burdens they are easy,\nAnd life's sorrows lose their sting,\nIf they're carried, Lord, to please Thee,\nIf their pain Thy smile should win.", "chorus Let me love Thee, Savior,\nTake my heart forever;\nNothing but Thy favor\nMy soul can satisfy.", "2 Let me love Thee, come revealing\nAll Thy love has done for me;\nHelp my heart, so unbelieving,\nBy the sight of Calvary:\nLet me see Thy love despising\nAll the shame my sins had brought;\nBy Thy torments realizing\nWhat a price my pardon bought.", "3 Let me love Thee, I am gladdest\nWhen I'm loving Thee, the best;\nFor in sunshine or in sadness\nI can find in Thee a rest;\nBut without Thee life is fading,\nTreasureless its choicest flowers;\nTaken are its gifts eternal;\nLeft, its empty passing hours.", "4 Let me love Thee, love is mighty,\nSwaying realms of deed and thought;\nBy it I shall walk uprightly,\nI shall serve Thee as I ought:\nLove will soften every sorrow,\nLove will lighten every care,\nLove unquestioning will follow,\nLove will triumph, love will dare."]
