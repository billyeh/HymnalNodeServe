["1 He healeth me, oh, bless His name!\nI want to spread abroad His fame;\nFrom dread disease He sets me free,\nThe Lord my healer, strong is He!", "chorus He healeth me, He healeth me!\nBy power divine He healeth me;\nHe healed the sick in Galilee,\nAnd now by faith He healeth me!", "2 He healeth me! my simple faith\nBelieves the word that Jesus saith,\nAnd takes the place of ardent hope,\nBelieves the Lord will raise me up.", "3 He healeth me! I touch for cure\nThe border of His garment pure,\nAnd virtue through my being flows,\nA healing balm for nature's woes.", "4 He healeth me, as when of yore,\nTheir sins and sicknesses He bore;\nNor has He lost His power and skill-\nOur blessed Christ is living still.", "5 He healeth me! how oft I sought\nThis healing power, but found it not:\nBut now I trust with all my soul,\nAnd now through faith He makes me whole."]
