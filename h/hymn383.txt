["1 My stubborn will at last hath yielded;\nI would be Thine, and Thine alone,\nAnd this the prayer my lips are bringing,\n\"Lord, let in me Thy will be done.\"", "chorus Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,\nTill I am wholly lost in Thee;\nSweet will of God, still fold me closer,\nTill I am wholly lost in Thee.", "2 I'm tired of sin, footsore and weary,\nThe darksome path hath dreary grown,\nBut now a light has ris'n to cheer me;\nI find in Thee my Star, my Sun.", "3 Thy precious will, O conqu'ring Savior,\nDoth now embrace and compass me;\nAll discords hushed, my peace a river,\nMy soul a prisoned bird set free.", "4 Shut in with Thee, O Lord, forever,\nMy wayward feet no more to roam;\nWhat pow'r from Thee my soul can sever?\nThe center of God's will my home."]
