{"1": "Dear Lord, Thou art so much to us
Thou art our all in all;
What Thou art fully meets our needs
Though they be great or small.
Our hearts appreciate what Thou art
Our spirits worship Thee;
Our grateful praise to Thee we give,
As we Thy riches see.",
"2": "Thou art the Prophet raised by God
With pow'r for God to speak;
Like Moses, Thou God's plan hast shown
That we God's will may seek.
Thou art like Jonah sent by God
To enter death and live
That by this sign of death and life
We may in Thee believe.",
"3": "Thou art the Prophet raised from men
To speak with pow'r and light;
Thou, like Elisha, filled with love
Thy miracles in might.
Thou, like Isaiah, full of grace
God's Christ dost e'er reveal
That we may share this Christ of all,
As life both rich and real.",
"4": "Thou art the Priest from us to God
The holy Priest for us
Like Aaron called of God from men
For us Thou servest thus.
In love Thou bearest us to God
The great High Priest to serve;
With love Thou intercedest there,
And dost with strength preserve.",
"5": "Thou art the Priest from God to us
The royal Priest of God;
Like Salem's King, Melchisedec
The minister of God.
With bread and wine Thou cam'st from God,
To us in time of need;
Thou cam'st with God that we in Him,
Might fully share indeed.",
"6": "Thou art the King as David was
And God's desire dost seek;
The battle fought, the foe subdued
God's heart Thou dost bespeak.
Thou art empowered on the throne
Not with a human rod
But with authority divine,
To reign for us and God.",
"7": "Thou art the King like Solomon
Whose rule with peace was filled;
With wisdom Thou dost reign in pow r,
And Thou God's house dost build.
As King unseen Thou reignest now,
Among Thy saints with love;
One day, when Thou shalt reign with us
Thou wilt Thy kingship prove.",
"8": "As King and Priest and Prophet too
How precious, Lord, art Thou;
Thy worth to God, Thy worth to us
We all with love avow.
O how we treasure what Thou art
Our hearts are drawn by Thee;
To Thee we'll give our thanks and praise,
Throughout eternity."}
