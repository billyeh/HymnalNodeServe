["1 Lo, the glory! Lo, the splendor!\nHeaven's Kingdom manifest!\nAnd its glorious King, our Master\nIs by God's appointment blest.\nOnce in flesh He came so lowly\nHated and despised by man;\nNow He comes again in glory,\nTo fulfill the Kingdom plan.", "2 Going to receive the Kingdom,\nFrom His God, the Ancient of Days\nNow He cometh with the Kingdom,\nAnd its glorious, ruling rays.\nHe's \"the Stone\" which breaks the nations,\nInto pieces lowliest\nWhich \"a mountain great\" becometh,\nAs the Kingdom manifest.", "3 Lo, the earth, all lands and kingdoms\nBy the Lord and Christ possessed;\nEarth beneath their sovereign ruling,\nWill be full of peace and rest.\nNo more war and no more hatred,\n'Twixt the nations will there be;\nBut God's knowledge shall suffuse them,\nAs the waters fill the sea.", "4 All the Christian overcomers,\nShall with Christ in glory reign\nAnd the remnant saved of Israel,\nThen God's priesthood shall obtain.\nAs God's people shall the nations,\n'Neath their rule and teaching be\nAnd a glorious restoration,\nAll creation then shall see.", "5 Satan will be bound and banished;\nFrom his rule will earth be freed;\nWith Christ's sovereign reign and headship,\nEarth will then be blessed indeed.\nAll to Christ will then be subject\nTo His pow'r and to His will;\nAs the Head and Center glorious\nHe God's purpose will fulfill."]
