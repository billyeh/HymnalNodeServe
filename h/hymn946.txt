{"1": "Lo, the glory! Lo, the splendor!
Heaven's Kingdom manifest!
And its glorious King, our Master
Is by God's appointment blest.
Once in flesh He came so lowly
Hated and despised by man;
Now He comes again in glory,
To fulfill the Kingdom plan.",
"2": "Going to receive the Kingdom,
From His God, the Ancient of Days
Now He cometh with the Kingdom,
And its glorious, ruling rays.
He's "the Stone" which breaks the nations,
Into pieces lowliest
Which "a mountain great" becometh,
As the Kingdom manifest.",
"3": "Lo, the earth, all lands and kingdoms
By the Lord and Christ possessed;
Earth beneath their sovereign ruling,
Will be full of peace and rest.
No more war and no more hatred,
'Twixt the nations will there be;
But God's knowledge shall suffuse them,
As the waters fill the sea.",
"4": "All the Christian overcomers,
Shall with Christ in glory reign
And the remnant saved of Israel,
Then God's priesthood shall obtain.
As God's people shall the nations,
'Neath their rule and teaching be
And a glorious restoration,
All creation then shall see.",
"5": "Satan will be bound and banished;
From his rule will earth be freed;
With Christ's sovereign reign and headship,
Earth will then be blessed indeed.
All to Christ will then be subject
To His pow'r and to His will;
As the Head and Center glorious
He God's purpose will fulfill."}
