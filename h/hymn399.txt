{"1": "Changed into His likeness!
This my heart's desire!
May the Lord fulfill it
All my soul inspire.",
"2": "Changed into His likeness!
He the Spirit is!
If the Spirit governs
He'll fulfill my wish.",
"3": "As a glass, beholding,
With uncovered face
I can see His glory,
And reflect His grace.",
"4": "O that no more covering,
May the Lord obscure
That I may reflect Him,
With a heart made pure.",
"5": "Gazing on His glory
Face to face to see;
Constantly beholding
Ever would I be.",
"6": "Changed into His likeness!
This my heart's one quest!
From my heart reflected
He will be expressed.",
"7": "Changed into His likeness,
And reflecting more,
Glory unto glory
Boundless evermore."}
