{"1": "Christian, dost thou see them
On the holy ground,
How the powers of darkness
Compass thee around?
Christian, up and smite them,
Counting gain but loss;
Smite them by the merit
Of the holy cross.",
"2": "Christian, dost thou feel them,
How they work within,
Striving, tempting, luring,
Goading into sin?
Christian, never tremble,
Never be downcast;
Gird thee for the conflict;
Watch, and pray, and fast.",
"3": "Christian, dost thou hear them,
How they speak thee fair?
"Always fast and vigil,
Always watch and prayer?"
Christian, answer boldly,
"While I breathe I pray";
Peace shall follow battle,
Night shall end in day."}
