["1 Olives that have known no pressure,\nNo oil can bestow;\nIf the grapes escape the winepress\nCheering wine can never flow;\nSpikenard only through the crushing\nFragrance can diffuse.\nShall I then, Lord, shrink from suff'ring,\nWhich Thy love for me would choose?", "chorus Each blow I suffer,\nIs true gain to me.\nIn the place of what Thou takest,\nThou dost give Thyself to me.", "2 Do my heart-strings need Thy stretching\nSongs divine to prove?\nDo I need for sweetest music,\nCruel treatment of Thy love?\nLord, I fear no deprivation,\nIf it draws to Thee;\nI would yield in full surrender,\nAll Thy heart of love to see.", "3 I'm ashamed, my Lord, for seeking,\nSelf to guard alway;\nThough Thy love has done its stripping\nYet I've been compelled this way.\nLord, according to Thy pleasure,\nFully work on me;\nHeeding not my human feelings\nOnly do what pleases Thee.", "4 If Thy mind and mine should differ\nStill pursue Thy way;\nIf Thy pleasure means my sorrow\nStill my heart shall answer, \"Yea!\n'Tis my deep desire to please Thee\nThough I suffer loss;\nE'en though Thy delight and glory,\nMean that I endure the cross.", "5 Oh, I'll praise Thee, e'en if weeping,\nMingle with my song.\nThine increasing sweetness calls forth,\nGrateful praises all day long.\nThou hast made Thyself more precious,\nThan all else to me:\nThou increase and I decrease, Lord-\nThis is now my only plea."]
