{"1": "Gathered round Thyself, Lord Jesus,
We now seek Thy face;
May we know Thy presence with us,
Lord of grace!",
"2": "Love divine first drew us to Thee,
In our sin and need;
For our sin, in deep compassion,
Thou didst bleed.",
"3": "Risen Lord, in glory seated,
We are one with Thee;
Thou hast snapt the chains that bound us,
We are free.",
"4": "Gratefully we Thee remember
As we break the bread,
Symbol of Thy body given
In our stead.",
"5": "Drink we too "the cup of blessing"
Which Thy love has filled;
Through Thy blood we have redemption
Fears are stilled.",
"6": "Backward look we, drawn to Calv'ry,
Musing while we sing;
Forward haste we to Thy coming,
Lord and King!"}
