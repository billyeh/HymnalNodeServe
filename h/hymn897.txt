["1 Work, for the Day is coming,\nDay in the Word foretold,\nWhen, 'mid the scenes triumphant,\nLonged for by saints of old,\nHe, who on earth a stranger\nTraversed its paths of pain,\nJesus, the Prince, the Savior,\nComes evermore to reign.", "2 Work, for the Day is coming,\nDarkness will soon be gone;\nThen o'er the night of weeping\nDay without end shall dawn.\nWhat now we sow in sadness\nThen we shall reap in joy;\nHope will be changed to gladness,\nPraise be our blest employ.", "3 Work, for the Day is coming,\nMade for the saints of light;\nOff with the garments dreary,\nOn with the armor bright:\nSoon will the strife be ended,\nSoon all our toils below;\nNot to the dark we're tending,\nBut to the Day we go.", "4 Work, for the Lord is coming,\nChildren of light are we;\nFrom Jesus' bright appearing\nPowers of darkness flee.\nOut of the mist, at His bidding,\nSouls like the dew are born:\nO'er all the East are spreading\nTints of the rosy morn.", "5 Work, then, the Day is coming,\nNo time for sighing now;\nPrize for the race awaits thee,\nWreaths for the victor's brow.\nNow morning Light is breaking,\nSoon will the Day appear;\nNight shades appall no longer,\nJesus, our Lord, is near."]
