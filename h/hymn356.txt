{"1": "Thou Magnet of my soul!
Let me come nearer, till
The life of self pulsates no more,
But is forever still.",
"2": "Thou Sunshine of my heart!
Fill Thou each crevice there,
And let Thy garden yield to Thee
A fragrance sweet and rare.",
"3": "Thou Ransomer from death!
Possess Thy ransomed one:
Appropriate to Thine Own use
The spoil that Thou hast won.",
"4": "Thou Lord of Life and Light!
I bow beneath Thy sway,
And count it holy privilege
Thy precepts to obey.",
"5": "Thou Gift unspeakable!
Straight from God's heart of love;
I break my heart to give Thee room
And thus Thy sweetness prove."}
