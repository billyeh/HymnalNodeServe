["1 All that we were-our sin, our guilt,\nOur death-was all our own:\nAll that we are we owe to Thee,\nThou God of grace alone.", "2 Thy mercy found us in our sins,\nAnd gave us to believe;\nThen, in believing, peace we found,\nAnd in Thy Christ we live.", "3 All that we are, as saints on earth,\nAll that we hope to be,\nWhen Jesus comes and glory dawns,\nWe owe it all to Thee.", "4 O God, how rich, how vast Thy love,\nWhoe'er can Thee repay?\nThy love is past man's finding out,\nThy grace no man can say.", "5 But Lord, to me I pray Thee grant,\nMore clearly may I see,\nThat I may e'er more fully know\nHow much I owe to Thee.", "6 But if man's heart should e'er suppose\nHe could repay Thy love,\nIt only means he nothing knows\nOf love, all loves above.", "7 So may we never bargains make\nWith that dear love of Thine:\nThe love that made Thine heart once break,\nWhoe'er that love could win?", "8 Then nevermore suggest return,\nHis love is far too high;\nBut let our hearts with rapture burn\nThat He for us should die.", "9 O Father God, we owe Thee all!\nAll that we are and have!\nWith grateful thanks before Thee fall,\n'Tis all that we can give."]
