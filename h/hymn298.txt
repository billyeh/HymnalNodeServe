["1 My hope is built on nothing less\nThan Jesus Christ, my righteousness;\nI dare not trust the sweetest frame,\nBut wholly lean on Jesus' name.", "chorus On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;\nAll other ground is sinking sand,\nAll other ground is sinking sand.", "2 When darkness veils His lovely face,\nI rest on His unchanging grace;\nIn every high and stormy gale,\nMy anchor holds within the veil.", "3 His oath, His covenant, His blood,\nSupport me in the whelming flood;\nWhen all around my soul gives way,\nHe then is all my hope and stay.", "4 When He shall come with trumpet sound,\nOh, may I then in Him be found;\nIn Him, my righteousness, alone,\nFaultless to stand before the throne."]
