{"1": "Christ is the mystery of God;
God is invisible, unshown
His image man hath never seen
But Christ the Son hath made Him known.",
"2": "Christ is the very Word of God
He is God's explanation true;
God's full embodiment is He,
And God's own image brings to view.",
"3": "Image of God invisible
Effulgence of God's glory fair;
God's fulness ever dwells in Him
God's testimony He doth bear.",
"4": "The Church the myst'ry is of Christ
For He is now to man unshown;
No man on earth may see Him now
But thru the Church He is made known.",
"5": "The Church is Christ's expression full
In her Christ dwelleth bodily;
She is His duplication true
And man in her Himself may see.",
"6": "The Church the image has of Christ
She is His increase and His spread;
Christ's very self is found in her,
The Body, she, to Christ the Head.",
"7": "Thus, in the Son the Father is
And now the Spirit is the Son;
The Spirit of the triune God,
Is in the Church and with her one."}
