["1 Ours is a fellowship in the gospel\nSince we received the Lord;\nWe're for the furtherance of the gospel,\nSpreading to all His Word.\nFor its defense and strong confirmation\nWe all partake of grace-\nHe who began this work will perfect it\nTill we shall see His face.", "2 May all the things that come to us daily\nUnto the gospel turn,\nThat all may see we're bound for the gospel\nAnd of the Lord may learn.\nMay we be bold and fearless in spirit,\nSpeaking the Word of God,\nDo it in love and do it in power,\nWhile living in the Lord.", "3 Lord, we're expecting that we'll be given\nBoldness with every breath.\nChrist must be magnified in our body\nWhether by life or death.\nWe hope in nothing to be ashamed,\nFor us to live is Christ-\nHe is the Person in all our living,\nOur everything, our life.", "4 May all our lives be worthy the gospel\nWhatever may betide,\nAll standing fast in oneness of spirit,\nAll striving side by side.\nLet us proclaim the gospel in fullness\nTo satisfy the Lord:\nChrist is the life, the church His expression,\nSound everywhere abroad."]
