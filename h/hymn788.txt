["1 When thou wakest in the morning\nEre thou tread'st the untried way\nOf the lot that lies before thee\nThrough the coming busy day;\nWhether sunbeams promise brightness,\nWhether dim forebodings fall,\nBe thy dawning glad or gloomy,\nGo to Jesus, tell Him all.", "2 In the calm of sweet communion\nLet thy daily work be done;\nIn the peace of soul-outpouring\nCare be banished, patience won;\nAnd if earth with its enchantments\nSeek thy spirit to enthrall,\nEre thou listen, ere thou answer,\nTurn to Jesus, tell Him all.", "3 Then, as hour by hour glides by thee,\nThou wilt blessed guidance know,\nThine own burdens being lightened,\nThou canst bear another's woe;\nThou canst help the weak ones onward,\nThou canst raise up those that fall:\nBut remember, while thou servest,\nStill tell Jesus, tell Him all.", "4 And if weariness creeps o'er thee\nAs the day wears to its close,\nOr if sudden fierce temptation\nBring thee face to face with foes;\nIn thy weakness, in thy peril,\nRaise to heaven a truthful call;\nStrength and calm for every crisis\nCome, in telling Jesus all."]
