{"1": "When thou wakest in the morning
Ere thou tread'st the untried way
Of the lot that lies before thee
Through the coming busy day;
Whether sunbeams promise brightness,
Whether dim forebodings fall,
Be thy dawning glad or gloomy,
Go to Jesus, tell Him all.",
"2": "In the calm of sweet communion
Let thy daily work be done;
In the peace of soul-outpouring
Care be banished, patience won;
And if earth with its enchantments
Seek thy spirit to enthrall,
Ere thou listen, ere thou answer,
Turn to Jesus, tell Him all.",
"3": "Then, as hour by hour glides by thee,
Thou wilt blessed guidance know,
Thine own burdens being lightened,
Thou canst bear another's woe;
Thou canst help the weak ones onward,
Thou canst raise up those that fall:
But remember, while thou servest,
Still tell Jesus, tell Him all.",
"4": "And if weariness creeps o'er thee
As the day wears to its close,
Or if sudden fierce temptation
Bring thee face to face with foes;
In thy weakness, in thy peril,
Raise to heaven a truthful call;
Strength and calm for every crisis
Come, in telling Jesus all."}
