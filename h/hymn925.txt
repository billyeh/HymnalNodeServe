{"1": "Outreach of the glorious gospel,
Is the flow of life within;
It is by our testimony,
That lost sinners we may win.",
"chorus": "Grant us, Lord, the living outflow
May Thy life through us be seen;
Through us as Thy living vessels,
Quicken people from within.",
"2": "It is by the life convincing,
That the people may believe;
It is by the life imparting,
That the souls may life receive.",
"3": "Always in the Lord abiding
As the branches fruit to bear;
By the inner life out-flowing,
Christ with others we may share.",
"4": "May our living be the preaching
Making Christ to others known;
Not the word of doctrine-preaching
But the seed of life be sown."}
