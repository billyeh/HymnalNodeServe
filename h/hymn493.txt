{"1": "O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now,
That gives us life and quickens us
With all Thy riches strengthening
O how divine and glorious!",
"2": "O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now,
That with Thy power liberates;
And by Thy liberation true,
The law of life now regulates.",
"3": "O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now,
That transforms us and saturates
And to Thine image true conforms,
And with Thy light illuminates.",
"4": "O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now,
Who in my spirit makes His home;
He mingles with my spirit too
And both one spirit thus become.",
"5": "Lord, teach me how to exercise,
My spirit now to contact Thee
That in Thy Spirit I may walk,
And live by Thy reality."}
