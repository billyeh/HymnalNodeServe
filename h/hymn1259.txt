{"1": "See the local churches,
'Midst the earth's dark night;
Jesus' testimony,
Bearing Him as light.
Formed by Him, unmeasured,
In the Spirit's mold-
All are one in nature,
One pure work of gold.",
"chorus": "See the local churches,
'Midst the earth's dark night;
Burning in the Spirit,
Shining forth with Christ.",
"2": "God in Christ, embodied,
As God's lampstand, He
Has become the Spirit,
The reality.
Spirit as the lampstand
Has been multiplied;
Many local churches,
Now are realized!",
"3": "Caring for the churches
Is the Son of Man:
Voice of many waters,
Stars in His right hand;
Eyes aflame; His face is
Shining as the sun;
Churches-fear no trial,
He's the living One!",
"4": "What can quench the lampstands?
Who can them defy?
More the opposition-
More they multiply!
Deeper darkness 'round them,
Brighter do they shine.
They are constituted
With the life divine.",
"5": "Soon the local churches
Shall the Bride become,
Bringing in that city-
New Jerusalem.
Then the many lampstands
Shall one lampstand be;
Triune God expressing,
Universally.",
"chorus": "Lo, from heav'n descending,
All the earth shall see
God's complete expression,
For eternity."}
