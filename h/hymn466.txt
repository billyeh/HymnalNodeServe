{"1": "He has entered! He has entered!
Every guest may now depart;
He has taken all the chamber
Of my once divided heart.",
"2": "He has entered! He has entered!
Vanish every doubt and sin;
He has taken full possession,
He is Lord of all within.",
"3": "Long at my poor heart He tarried,
Knocking with His wounded hand;
Wide at last to Him I opened,
Yielding all to His command.",
"4": "He has entered! He has entered!
Every sorrow now must flee;
Where He reigns as King and Master,
There no grief can ever be."}
