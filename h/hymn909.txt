{"1": "In the stream! in the stream! let us work,
for the Lord
By His mind, in His way, as revealed in,
His Word;
In the flow of His life let us work with His,
pow'r,
For His Kingdom and Church in the time of His hour.",
"chorus": "In the stream! in the stream!
Let us work in the stream!
In the stream! in the stream!
We'll work as in the heav'nly team!",
"2": "In the stream! in the stream! let us work,
with the Lord,
In the flow of the Spirit, as taught by,
His Word;
Never working by self, independent and,
free
But in service related in full harmony.

"3": "In the stream! in the stream! let us work,
in the Lord
With the Church, with the saints, in the,
light of His Word;
Give the Word, life supply to the people,
in need
Thus fulfilling God's plan, in His flow we'll proceed."}
