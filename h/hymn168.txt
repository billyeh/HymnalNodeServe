["1 Now in a song of grateful praise,\nTo Thee, O Lord, my voice I'll raise;\nWith all Thy saints I'll join to tell,\nMy Savior has done all things well.", "chorus And above the rest this note shall swell,\nThis note shall swell, this note shall swell,\nAnd above the rest this note shall swell,\nMy Savior has done all things well.", "2 How sov'reign, wonderful and free,\nHas been Thy love to sinful me!\nThou sav'dst me from the jaws of hell;\nMy Savior has done all things well.", "3 Since e'er my soul has known His love,\nWhat mercies He has made me prove,\nMercies which do all praise excel,\nMy Savior has done all things well.", "4 And when on that bright day I rise,\nAnd join the anthems of the skies,\nAbove the rest this note shall swell,\nMy Savior has done all things well."]
