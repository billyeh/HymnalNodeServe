["1 Hark, the Savior's knocking, knocking\nKnocking at your heart!\nOh, do not be hardened, hardened\nLest He should depart.\nRise and open up your heart\nQuickly let Him in;\nLife divine He'll give you, give you\nAnd forgive your sin.", "chorus Let Him in! Let Him in!\nHe's knocking at your heart;\nLet Him in! Oh, let Him in!\nLet Him in your heart.", "2 Why should you still tarry, tarry\nKeep Him waiting there?\nHe is kind and gracious, gracious\nMerciful and dear.\nListen to His tender voice,\nDo not grieve His heart\nWon't you let Him enter, enter\nAnd His grace impart."]
