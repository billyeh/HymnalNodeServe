["1 Fairest Lord Jesus!\nRuler of all nature!\nO Thou of God and man the Son!\nThee will I cherish,\nThee will I honor,\nThou, my soul's glory, joy, and crown!", "2 Fair are the meadows\nFairer still the woodlands,\nRobed in the blooming garb of spring;\nJesus is fairer,\nJesus is purer,\nWho makes the woeful heart to sing!", "3 Fair is the sunshine,\nFairer still the moonlight,\nAnd all the twinkling starry host;\nJesus shines brighter,\nJesus shines purer,\nThan all the angels heav'n can boast!", "4 All fairest beauty,\nHeavenly and earthly,\nWondrously, Jesus, is found in Thee;\nNone can be nearer,\nFairer, or dearer,\nThan Thou my Savior art to me."]
