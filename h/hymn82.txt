["1 Down from His glory,\nEver living story,\nMy God and Savior came,\nAnd Jesus was His name.\nBorn in a manger,\nTo His own a stranger,\nA Man of sorrows, tears and agony.", "chorus O how I love Him! How I adore Him!\nMy breath, my sunshine, my all in all!\nThe great Creator became my Savior,\nAnd all God's fulness dwelleth in Him.", "2 What condescension,\nBringing us redemption;\nThat in the dead of night,\nNot one faint hope in sight,\nGod, gracious, tender,\nLaid aside His splendor,\nStooping to woo, to win, to save my soul.", "3 Without reluctance,\nFlesh and blood His substance\nHe took the form of man,\nRevealed the hidden plan.\nO glorious myst'ry,\nSacrifice of Calv'ry,\nAnd now I know Thou art the great \"I AM.\""]
