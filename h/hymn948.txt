{"1": "Myst'ry hid from ages now revealed to me
'Tis the Christ of God's reality.
He embodies God, and He is life to me
And the glory of my hope He'll be.",
"chorus": "Glory, glory, Christ is life in me!
Glory, glory, what a hope is He!
Now within my spirit He's the mystery!
Then the glory He will be to me.",
"2": "In my spirit He regenerated me
In my soul He's now transforming me.
He will change my body like unto His own
Wholly making me the same as He.",
"3": "Now in life and nature He is one with me,
Then in Him, the glory, I will be;
I'll enjoy His presence for eternity,
With Him in complete conformity."}
