["1 Soldiers of Christ, arise,\nAnd put your armor on,\nStrong in the strength which God supplies,\nThrough His eternal Son;\nStrong in the Lord of Hosts,\nAnd in His mighty pow'r,\nWho in the strength of Jesus trusts\nIs more than conqueror.", "2 Stand then in His great might,\nWith all His strength endued;\nAnd take, to arm you for the fight,\nThe panoply of God,\nThat, having all things done,\nAnd all your conflicts past,\nYe may o'ercome through Christ alone,\nAnd stand complete at last.", "3 Leave no unguarded place,\nNo weakness of the soul,\nTake every virtue, every grace,\nAnd fortify the whole.\nTo keep your armor bright\nAttend with constant care,\nStill walking in your Captain's sight\nAnd watching unto prayer.", "4 Pray, without ceasing pray,\nYour Captain gives the word;\nHis summons cheerfully obey,\nAnd call upon the Lord:\nTo God your every want\nIn instant prayer display;\nPray always; pray, and never faint;\nPray, without ceasing pray.", "5 From strength to strength go on;\nWrestle, and fight, and pray;\nTread all the powers of darkness down,\nAnd win the well-fought day:\nStill let the Spirit cry\nIn all His soldiers, \"Come!\"\nTill Christ the Lord descend from high,\nAnd take the conquerors home."]
