{"1": "A flowing river and a tree
Eden's outstanding features are
Man to supply with food and drink,
That he may live fore'er.",
"chorus": "God is in Christ to be my supply
God as the Spirit nourisheth me;
If upon Christ in spirit I feed
Filled with His life I'll be.",
"2": "The tree the glorious Christ does show,
As living food to man supplied
That he God's riches may enjoy
Thus to be satisfied.",
"3": "The river does the Spirit show
Coming man's spirit to supply
That with God's riches he be filled
Holy to be thereby.",
"4": "The Christ of glory is my life
He as the Spirit lives in mine
That I with God be fully blent,
And in His image shine.",
"5": "I would exalt this glorious Christ
Ever the Spirit I'd obey
Making His glory fully known
Filled with His grace for aye."}
