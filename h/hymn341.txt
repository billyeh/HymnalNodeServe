["1 When peace like a river attendeth my way,\nWhen sorrows like sea billows roll;\nWhatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say,\n\"It is well, it is well with my soul!\"", "chorus It is well with my soul!\nIt is well, it is well with my soul!", "2 Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,\nLet this blest assurance control,\nThat Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,\nAnd hath shed His own blood for my soul.", "3 My sin-oh, the bliss of this glorious thought-\nMy sin, not in part, but the whole,\nIs nailed to His Cross, and I bear it no more;\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!", "4 For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live;\nIf dark hours about me shall roll,\nNo pang shall be mine, for in death as in life\nThou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul."]
