["1 I wandered in the shades of night,\nTill Jesus came to me,\nAnd with the sunlight of His love\nBid all my darkness flee.", "chorus Sunlight, sunlight, in my soul today,\nSunlight, sunlight, all along the way,\nSince the Savior found me, took away my sin,\nI have had the sunlight of His love within.", "2 Though clouds may gather in the sky,\nAnd billows 'round me roll,\nHowever dark the world may be,\nI've sunlight in my soul.", "3 While walking in the light of God,\nI sweet communion find;\nI press with holy vigor on\nAnd leave the world behind.", "4 Soon I shall see Him as He is,\nThe Light that came to me;\nBehold the brightness of His face,\nThroughout etemity."]
