{"1": "I wandered in the shades of night,
Till Jesus came to me,
And with the sunlight of His love
Bid all my darkness flee.",
"chorus": "Sunlight, sunlight, in my soul today,
Sunlight, sunlight, all along the way,
Since the Savior found me, took away my sin,
I have had the sunlight of His love within.",
"2": "Though clouds may gather in the sky,
And billows 'round me roll,
However dark the world may be,
I've sunlight in my soul.",
"3": "While walking in the light of God,
I sweet communion find;
I press with holy vigor on
And leave the world behind.",
"4": "Soon I shall see Him as He is,
The Light that came to me;
Behold the brightness of His face,
Throughout etemity."}
