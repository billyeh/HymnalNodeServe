{"1": "When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion,
We were like them that dream,
We were like them that dream.",
"2": "Then was our mouth filled with laughter,
And our tongue with singing:
Then said they among the nations,
The Lord hath done great things,
The Lord hath done great things for them.",
"chorus": "The Lord hath done great things for us;
Whereof we are glad.
The Lord hath done great things for us;
Whereof we are glad.",
"3": "Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams,
As the streams in the south,
As the streams in the south.",
"4": "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy,
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.",
"5": "He that goeth forth and weepeth,
Bearing precious seed, shall doubtless,
Come again with rejoicing,
Come again with rejoicing,
Bringing his sheaves with him.",
"chorus": "The Lord hath done great things for us;
Whereof we are glad.
The Lord hath done great things for us;
Whereof we are glad.",
"6": "When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion,
We were like them that dream,
We were like them that dream."}
