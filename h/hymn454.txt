{"1": "I lift my heart to Thee,
Savior Divine,
For Thou art all to me,
And I am Thine;
Is there on earth a closer bond than this,
That my Beloved's mine, and I am His?",
"2": "Thine am I by all ties,
And chiefly Thine,
For through Thy sacrifice
Thou, Lord, art mine;
By Thine own cords of love, so sweetly wound
Around me, closely I to Thee am bound.",
"3": "To Thee, Thou Bleeding Lamb,
I all things owe,
All that I have and am,
And all I know;
All that I have is now no longer mine,
And I am not my own: "Lord, I am Thine.",
"4": "How can I, Lord, withhold
Life's brightest hour
From Thee; or gathered gold,
Or any power?
Why should I keep one precious thing from Thee,
When Thou hast given Thine own dear Self for me?",
"5": "I pray Thee, Savior, keep
Me in Thy love,
Until the world Thou sweep
And me remove
To that fair realm, where, sin and sorrow o'er,
Thou and Thine own are one for evermore."}
