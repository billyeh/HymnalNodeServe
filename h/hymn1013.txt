{"1": "What can keep the wanderers from going,
all astray?
Nothing but the love of Jesus!
What can turn the fallen people from,
their sinful way?
Nothing but the love of Jesus!",
"chorus": "Nothing but the love of Jesus,",
can constrain!
Nothing but the love of Jesus,",
can sustain!
Nothing both in heav'n and earth can,
sinners gain
Nothing but the love of Jesus!",
"2": "What can chase the bitterness from all,
the suffering ones?
Nothing but the love of Jesus!
What can wipe away the tears of all,
the weeping ones?
Nothing but the love of Jesus!",
"3": "What as ointment to the wound can heal,
the wounded hearts?
Nothing but the love of Jesus!
What as showers to the drought can cheer,
despairing hearts?
Nothing but the love of Jesus!",
"4": "What can satisfy the human life,
of vanity?
Nothing but the love of Jesus!
What can swallow up the taste of,
all mortality?
Nothing but the love of Jesus!"}
