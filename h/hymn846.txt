{"1": "Oh, may my spirit flow
Oh, may it flow!
Now I beseech Thee, Lord,
Oh, may it flow!
My past I would forsake
The iron walls would break
My spirit free would make;
Oh, may it flow!",
"2": "Oh, may my spirit flow
Oh, may it flow!
Now I implore Thee, Lord
Oh, may it flow!
No more self-satisfied
No more in self-bound pride
No more my spirit tied;
Oh, may it flow!",
"3": "Oh, may my spirit flow
Oh, may it flow!
For this I plead with Thee
Oh, may it flow!
High-minded not to be
Pride shall not prison me
I'd flow unceasingly
In spirit flow.",
"4": "Oh, may my spirit flow
Oh, may it flow!
For this I seek Thee, Lord
Oh, may it flow!
No more to isolate
Nor self to perfect make
My spirit nought abate
Deeply to flow.

"5": "Oh, may my spirit flow
Oh, may it flow!
I ask Thee, gracious Lord
Oh, may it flow!
My trust in self o'erthrow
Down from self's throne I'll go
That living water flow,
In spirit, Lord.",
"6": "Oh, may my spirit flow
Oh, may it flow!
Answer my prayer, dear Lord
Oh, may it flow!
Not just commune with Thee
I long to builded be
Mingle with others free,
In spirit, Lord."}
