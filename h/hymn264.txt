{"1": "Jesus, Thine all-victorious love
Shed in my soul abroad;
Then shall my heart no longer rove,
Rooted and fixed in God,
Rooted and fixed in God.",
"2": "Oh, that in me the sacred fire
Might now begin to glow;
Burn up the dross of base desire,
And make the mountains flow,
And make the mountains flow.",
"3": "He, who at Pentecost didst fall,
May He my sins consume;
Thy Holy Ghost, for Him I call;
Thy burning Spirit, come,
Thy burning Spirit, come.",
"4": "Refining fire, go through my heart,
Illuminate my soul;
Scatter Thy life through every part,
And sanctify the whole,
And sanctify the whole.",
"5": "My steadfast soul, from falling free,
Shall then no longer move,
While Christ is all the world to me,
And all my heart is love,
And all my heart is love."}
