{"1": "There in old Chaldea, product of man's fall,
God appeared to Abram-called him from it all.
"Get thee from thy country, from thy father's clan,
Get thee from thy kindred to another land."",
"chorus": "Our Lord God Jehovah called a corporate man,
One that would express Him and fulfill His plan.",
"2": "Through the Lord's infusion, Abraham became
Father of the faithful-life had changed his name.
Though the Lord's appearing, brought him to the land,
Still he needed Isaac to fulfill God's plan.",
"3": "Isaac from his father did inherit all:
Sonship's full enjoyment, blessing of God's call.
Though all things receiving, incomplete was he;
Lacking transformation and maturity.",
"4": "In his father's footsteps, Jacob then became
Prince of God, a wrestler, Israel his name;
By the Spirit's dealing, fully grown, he reigned;
O'er the earth, through Joseph, ruling pow'r obtained.",
"5": "Thus do Jacob, Isaac, Abraham portray
Path that we, God's called ones, must walk in today:
Members of the Body, as a corporate man,
We complete His calling and fulfill His plan."}
