["1 \"Forward!\" be our watchword,\nSteps and voices joined;\nSeek the things before us,\nNot a look behind;\nBurns the fiery pillar\nAt our army's head;\nWho shall dream of shrinking,\nBy our Captain led?\nForward through the desert,\nThrough the toil and fight;\nHeaven's Kingdom waits us,\nForward into light.", "2 Glories upon glories\nHath our God prepared,\nBy the souls that love Him,\nOne day to be shared:\nEye hath not beheld them,\nEar hath never heard;\nNor of these hath uttered\nThought or speech or word;\nForward, marching forward\nWhere the kingdom's bright,\nTill the veil be lifted,\nTill our faith be sight!"]
