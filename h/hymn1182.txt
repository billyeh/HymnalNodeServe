{"1": "In spirit and reality
We meet to worship Thee,
And every principality
Must fall down or must flee.
Reality, reality,
O what a joy to see,
That Christ may be enjoyed by us
As our reality.",
"2": "A Person, Thou hast come in us,
Into our spirit now,
And quickened us until we know
Our inner man art Thou.
O praise Thee, Lord, we sense Thee thus,
Forever inwardly;
Thy Person in each one of us
Is our reality.",
"3": "And now the corporate life we live-
Christ in His Body known;
Where every portion adds more Christ,
Until the whole is shown.
O Hallelujah, one new man!
Our portions blend as one;
In one accord, express the Lord,
And He will quickly come."}
