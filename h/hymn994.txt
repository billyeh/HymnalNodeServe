["1 Oh, how dark the night that wrapt my spirit round!\nOh, how deep the woe my Savior found\nWhen He walked across the waters of my soul,\nBade my night disperse and made me whole!", "chorus All the way to Calvary He went for me,\nHe went for me, He went for me;\nAll the way to Calvary He went for me,\nHe died to set me free.", "2 Tremblingly a sinner bowed before His face,\nNaught I knew of pardon, God's free grace;\nHeard a voice so melting, \"Cease thy wild regret,\nJesus bought thy pardon, paid thy debt.\"", "3 O 'twas wondrous love the Savior showed for me!\nWhen He left His throne for Calvary,\nWhen He bore my trespass, bore it all alone;\nPraise His Name forever, make it known."]
