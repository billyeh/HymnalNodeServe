{"1": "We praise Thee for Thy righteousness;
Thy justice, Father, we confess
And fully testify.
Thou art the judge of all mankind
In Thee injustice none can find
Nor wrong to Thee apply.",
"2": "O holy Father, righteous One
Thy righteousness upholds Thy throne
'Tis a foundation sure.
'Tis through this righteousness of Thine,
That reigns in Christ the grace divine
And peace we thus secure.",
"3": "Thy righteousness has caused Thy Son,
To die for us that we be won
Redemption thus was bought;
Thy righteousness has justified,
When Christ's redemption was applied
Salvation thus was wrought.",
"4": "That Thou might show Thy righteousness
With Thy forgiveness Thou didst bless,
Men in the ancient age;
For Thee Thy righteousness to show
Remission Thou dost now bestow,
On sinners in this age.",
"5": "All people Thou wilt judge one day
Thy righteousness to all display,
By Christ, Thy Son, our Lord;
Yet fast we'll stand, for none can move
Thy righteousness we'll ever prove
With grace Thou wilt afford.",
"6": "With justice is Thy kingdom filled
And peace upon it Thou dost build,
With all in harmony;
In the new heaven and new earth,
Thy righteousness will be their worth
As promised, God, by Thee."}
