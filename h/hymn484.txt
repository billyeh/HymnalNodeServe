{"1": "When Christ once died on Calvary,
I too was there;
'Twas in my place He stood for me,
And now accepted e'en as He,
His name I bear.",
"chorus": "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live,
Yet, not I, but Christ who liveth in me;
And the life I live in the flesh,
I live by the faith of the Son of God,
Who loved, and gave Himself for me.",
"2": "When Christ once rose with life divine,
I too was there;
His resurrection pow'r is mine,
And as the branches and the vine
His life I share.",
"3": "When Christ will come some day for me,
I shall be there;
With Him and like Him I shall be,
And all His glorious majesty
I too shall share.",
"4": "O blessed life so deep, so high,
Lord, keep me there;
Help me with Christ to live, to die,
And let me with Him, bye and bye
His glory share."}
