["1 God's intention is to have us,\nAll conformed to His dear Son;\nThus a work of transformation,\nBy the Spirit must be done.", "chorus Lord, transform us to Thine image,\nIn emotion, mind, and will;\nSaturate us with Thy Spirit\nAll our being wholly fill.", "2 God hath us regenerated,\nIn our spirit with His life;\nBut He must transform us further-\nIn our soul by His own life.", "3 Spreading outward from our spirit,\nDoth the Lord transform our soul\nBy the inward parts renewing\nTill within His full control.", "4 By the power of His Spirit,\nIn His pattern He transforms;\nFrom His glory to His glory,\nTo His image He conforms.", "5 He transforms, all sanctifying\nTill like Him we are matured;\nHe transforms, our soul possessing\nTill His stature is secured."]
