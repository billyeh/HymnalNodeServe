{"1": "God's intention is to have us,
All conformed to His dear Son;
Thus a work of transformation,
By the Spirit must be done.",
"chorus": "Lord, transform us to Thine image,
In emotion, mind, and will;
Saturate us with Thy Spirit
All our being wholly fill.",
"2": "God hath us regenerated,
In our spirit with His life;
But He must transform us further-
In our soul by His own life.",
"3": "Spreading outward from our spirit,
Doth the Lord transform our soul
By the inward parts renewing
Till within His full control.",
"4": "By the power of His Spirit,
In His pattern He transforms;
From His glory to His glory,
To His image He conforms.",
"5": "He transforms, all sanctifying
Till like Him we are matured;
He transforms, our soul possessing
Till His stature is secured."}
