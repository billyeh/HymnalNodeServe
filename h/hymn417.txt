{"1": "Deep in me, Lord, mark Thou Thy holy Cross,
On motives, choices, private dear desires.
Let all that self in any form inspires
Be unto me as dross.",
"2": "And when Thy touch of death is here and there
Laid on a thing most precious in mine eyes.
Let me not wonder, let me recognize
The answer to my prayer."}
