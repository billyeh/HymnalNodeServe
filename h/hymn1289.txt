{"1": "The vict'ry's won! The Lord has triumphed o'er the foe!
The vict'ry shout is heard afar and near!
His blood prevails! It giveth us the victory!
And soon the mighty Victor will appear.",
"chorus": "Sisters:
The vict'ry's won! O Christian brothers,
The vict'ry's won! This shout we raise!
In Zion's city, proclaim His vict'ry
Till all the earth is filled with praise.
Brothers:
The vict'ry's won! O Christian sisters,
The mighty work of Christ is done!
The Lord victorious has conquered for us-
Eternal joys have now begun.",
"2": "The vict'ry's won! We've overcome the enemy.
The Word of God we boldly testify.
God speaks His Word-in it there's life and liberty-
And by the Word the devil we defy.",
"3": "The vict'ry's won! Beneath our feet the enemy,
For we love not our soul life unto death;
And so we shout, "O Lord, You are our victory!"
And praise our God with all our spirit's breath."}
