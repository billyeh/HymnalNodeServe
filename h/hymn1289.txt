["1 The vict'ry's won! The Lord has triumphed o'er the foe!\nThe vict'ry shout is heard afar and near!\nHis blood prevails! It giveth us the victory!\nAnd soon the mighty Victor will appear.", "chorus Sisters:\nThe vict'ry's won! O Christian brothers,\nThe vict'ry's won! This shout we raise!\nIn Zion's city, proclaim His vict'ry\nTill all the earth is filled with praise.\nBrothers:\nThe vict'ry's won! O Christian sisters,\nThe mighty work of Christ is done!\nThe Lord victorious has conquered for us-\nEternal joys have now begun.", "2 The vict'ry's won! We've overcome the enemy.\nThe Word of God we boldly testify.\nGod speaks His Word-in it there's life and liberty-\nAnd by the Word the devil we defy.", "3 The vict'ry's won! Beneath our feet the enemy,\nFor we love not our soul life unto death;\nAnd so we shout, \"O Lord, You are our victory!\"\nAnd praise our God with all our spirit's breath."]
