["1 In full and glad surrender,\nI give myself to Thee,\nThine utterly and only\nAnd evermore to be.", "2 O Son of God, who lov'st me,\nI will be Thine alone;\nAnd all I have and am, Lord,\nShall henceforth be Thine own!", "3 Reign over me, Lord Jesus;\nOh, make my heart Thy throne;\nIt shall be Thine, dear Savior,\nIt shall be Thine alone.", "4 Oh, come and reign, Lord Jesus,\nRule over everything!\nAnd keep me always loyal,\nAnd true to Thee, my King."]
