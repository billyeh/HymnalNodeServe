{"1": "In full and glad surrender,
I give myself to Thee,
Thine utterly and only
And evermore to be.",
"2": "O Son of God, who lov'st me,
I will be Thine alone;
And all I have and am, Lord,
Shall henceforth be Thine own!",
"3": "Reign over me, Lord Jesus;
Oh, make my heart Thy throne;
It shall be Thine, dear Savior,
It shall be Thine alone.",
"4": "Oh, come and reign, Lord Jesus,
Rule over everything!
And keep me always loyal,
And true to Thee, my King."}
