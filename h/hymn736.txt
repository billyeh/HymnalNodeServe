{"1": "In ancient times the law of God,
In letter was engraved on stone;
But now it is a law of life
Which in our heart is written down.",
"2": "The law in letters good demands,
And thus our utter weakness shows;
But now the law of life sustains
And strength for God to please bestows.",
"3": "The law in letters brings to us,
God's knowledge only outwardly;
But now the law of life supplies,
A deeper knowledge inwardly.",
"4": "The law in letters can but rule,
By dead commandments outwardly;
But now the law of life controls,
By living knowledge inwardly.",
"5": "This living law is moving now,
In all of our experience
To regulate us from within,
And check us by our inner sense.",
"6": "How deep its regulation is,
Within the inmost part of us
A living consciousness to give
And God Himself impart to us.",
"7": "'Tis by this living law of life,
We need no teaching outwardly
For all God's living knowledge now,
This law will teach us inwardly.",
"8": "Lord, teach us by this law to walk
Its inner ruling to obey
That we may of Thyself partake,
And know Thee in a living way."}
