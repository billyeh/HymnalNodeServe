{"1": "As we're sharing of the cup
How can we restrain our praise;
For the blood Thou shedd'st for us
Worth of which none can appraise.
O how precious is Thy blood!
All our problems it resolves;
In Thine efficacious blood,
All our care and fear dissolves.",
"2": "It is by this blood of worth,
The new testament was made;
For this better covenant
'Tis a sure foundation laid.
We have been redeemed by God
Not with silver or with gold
But, Lord, with Thy precious blood
Which Thy love doth e'er unfold.",
"3": "For remission of our sins,
Thou hast shed Thy cleansing blood.
Which for us has fully met,
All the righteous claims of God.
Thou hast washed us from our sins,
In Thy pow'rful purging blood;
And our conscience purged by it
Thus to serve the living God.",
"4": "By Thy separating blood
We have all been sanctified;
'Tis by Thy preserving blood,
Holiness is testified.
By Thy propitiating blood
We have all been justified;
'Tis by Thy redeeming blood,
God is fully satisfied.",
"5": "Thru Thy blood shed on the cross
We are reconciled to God
That the way to contact Him,
May in peace by us be trod.
By partaking of Thy blood
We have Thine eternal life;
In Thy blood and life received
We have rest, free from all strife.",
"6": "Now, in heav'n Thy sprinkled blood,
Speaks for us of better things;
Under its defending pow'r,
We are kept from Satan's stings.
By Thine overcoming blood
We defeat the enemy;
Over our accuser thus
We will have the victory.",
"7": "Of Thy blood, for fellowship
We commune with all Thy saints;
Under its full covering
Our freed spirit never faints.
How can we exhaust, in words
The account of Thy dear blood;
We will need eternity,
To declare its boundless good."}
