["1 As we're sharing of the cup\nHow can we restrain our praise;\nFor the blood Thou shedd'st for us\nWorth of which none can appraise.\nO how precious is Thy blood!\nAll our problems it resolves;\nIn Thine efficacious blood,\nAll our care and fear dissolves.", "2 It is by this blood of worth,\nThe new testament was made;\nFor this better covenant\n'Tis a sure foundation laid.\nWe have been redeemed by God\nNot with silver or with gold\nBut, Lord, with Thy precious blood\nWhich Thy love doth e'er unfold.", "3 For remission of our sins,\nThou hast shed Thy cleansing blood.\nWhich for us has fully met,\nAll the righteous claims of God.\nThou hast washed us from our sins,\nIn Thy pow'rful purging blood;\nAnd our conscience purged by it\nThus to serve the living God.", "4 By Thy separating blood\nWe have all been sanctified;\n'Tis by Thy preserving blood,\nHoliness is testified.\nBy Thy propitiating blood\nWe have all been justified;\n'Tis by Thy redeeming blood,\nGod is fully satisfied.", "5 Thru Thy blood shed on the cross\nWe are reconciled to God\nThat the way to contact Him,\nMay in peace by us be trod.\nBy partaking of Thy blood\nWe have Thine eternal life;\nIn Thy blood and life received\nWe have rest, free from all strife.", "6 Now, in heav'n Thy sprinkled blood,\nSpeaks for us of better things;\nUnder its defending pow'r,\nWe are kept from Satan's stings.\nBy Thine overcoming blood\nWe defeat the enemy;\nOver our accuser thus\nWe will have the victory.", "7 Of Thy blood, for fellowship\nWe commune with all Thy saints;\nUnder its full covering\nOur freed spirit never faints.\nHow can we exhaust, in words\nThe account of Thy dear blood;\nWe will need eternity,\nTo declare its boundless good."]
