{"1": "The law of God is holy, good
To practise good it doth command;
Its purpose is to clearly show,
That we cannot meet God's demand.",
"2": "Yet in our mind there is a law,
Which always tries the good to do;
But in our members is a law,
Which always doth this law subdue.",
"3": "The law within our mind is good
'Tis of our human life obtained,
At our creation from the Lord
That good behavior be maintained.",
"4": "The law within our members is,
The evil of satanic life;
Into our members at the fall,
It came thru Satan's subtle strife.",
"5": "This evil law of Satan is,
The law of sin, in us its seat;
'Tis stronger than the law of good,
And always brings it to defeat.",
"6": "But in our spirit is a law
Which is the Spirit's law of life;
'Tis of the very life of God,
Which we from our rebirth derive.",
"7": "This law divine the strongest is
Transcending all the others o'er;
From sin's law freeing, it fulfills,
The full requirement of God's law.",
"8": "We then must always set our mind,
Upon the spirit deep within
And not upon the things of flesh
The body ruined by the sin.",
"9": "To set the mind upon the flesh,
Is sin and death and darkest night;
The mind upon the spirit set,
Is life and peace and full of light.",
"10": "This is the way of true release!
This is the way of victory!
Lord, may we in the spirit live
And by the Spirit walk with Thee."}
