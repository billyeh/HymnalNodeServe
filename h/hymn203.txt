{"1": "In the bosom of the Father
Ere the ages had begun
Thou wast in the Father's glory
God's unique begotten Son.
When to us the Father gave Thee
Thou in person wast the same
All the fulness of the Father,
In the Spirit to proclaim.",
"2": "By Thy death and resurrection
Thou wast made God's firstborn Son;
By Thy life to us imparting
Was Thy duplication done.
We, in Thee regenerated
Many sons to God became;
Truly as Thy many brethren
We are as Thyself the same.",
"3": "Once Thou wast the only grain, Lord
Falling to the earth to die
That thru death and resurrection,
Thou in life may multiply.
We were brought forth in Thy nature,
And the many grains became;
As one loaf we all are blended
All Thy fulness to proclaim,",
"4": "We're Thy total reproduction
Thy dear Body and Thy Bride
Thine expression and Thy fulness
For Thee ever to abide.
We are Thy continuation
Thy life-increase and Thy spread
Thy full growth and Thy rich surplus
One with Thee, our glorious Head."}
