["1 Life at best is very brief,\nLike the falling of a leaf,\nLike the binding of a sheaf,\nBe in time!\nFleeting days are telling fast\nThat the die will soon be cast,\nAnd the fatal line be passed,\nBe in time!", "chorus Be in time! Be in time!\nWhile the voice of Jesus calls you,\nBe in time!\nIf in sin you longer wait,\nYou may find no open gate,\nAnd your cry be just too late:\nBe in time!", "2 Fairest flowers soon decay,\nYouth and beauty pass away;\nO you have not long to stay,\nBe in t;me!\nWhile God's Spirit bids you come,\nSinner, do not longer roam,\nLest you seal your hopeless doom,\nBe in time!", "3 Time is gliding swiftly by,\nDeath and judgment draweth nigh,\nTo the arms of Jesus fly,\nBe in time!\nO I pray you count the cost!\nEre the fatal line be crossed,\nAnd your soul in hell be lost,\nBe in time!", "4 Sinner, heed the warning voice,\nMake the Lord your final choice,\nThen all heaven will rejoice,\nBe in time!\nCome from darkness into light;\nCome, let Jesus make you right;\nCome, receive His life tonight,\nBe in time!"]
