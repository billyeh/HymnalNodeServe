{"1": "Blest Father of glory, we worship:
Thy greatness surpasses our praise;
We bless Thee Thy Spirit within us
Gives pow'r to these heavenly lays.",
"2": "We think of the Man in Thy presence,
Set down there, exalted as Head;
Once raised by the might of Thy power,
When numbered along with the dead.",
"3": "We think of the glory that chose us,
'Twas Thine, blessed Father, the Source;
The glory of love that redeemed us
Through Jesus, the Man of Thy choice.",
"4": "As marked out beforehand for sonship,
We praise now the glory of grace
And bow in Thy presence and worship,
As conscious, in Christ, of our place."}
