All His character and persons are expressed;
Unto Adam's sons His mystery is revealed
Fully illustrated and made manifest.",

That His Son should have pre-eminence in all
That in His dear Son He might be glorified,
Midst all His creation, either great or small.",

He is very God and yet is truly man;
He is all in all, in Him all things subsist
Center and circumference of th' eternal plan.",

Christ and His expression has His counsel willed:
Christ with all God's fulness as the glorious Head
And the Church His Body, with His riches filled.",
"5": "God the Lord has spoken, and from heaven shown,
That the triune God would blend with creature-man:
Father in the Son, the Son the Spirit is
Dwelling in the Body to fulfill His plan.",

Of His vast creation and His lowly birth
Of His great redemption and salvation full;
May His adoration ever fill the earth."}
