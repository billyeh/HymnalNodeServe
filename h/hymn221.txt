{"1": "Lord, we thank Thee for the table
With the bread and with the wine;
At this table we enjoy Thee,
As the feast of love divine.
We partake the bread, the emblem,
Of Thy body giv'n for us;
And we share the wine, the symbol,
Of Thy blood Thou shedd'st for us.",
"chorus": "Lo, the holy table!
With the sacred symbols;
Its significance in figure,
Is unsearchable!",
"2": "By the death of Thy redemption
That Thy life Thou may impart
E'en Thyself to us Thou gavest,
That we share in all Thou art.
By the bread and wine partaking
We Thy death display and prove;
Eating, drinking of Thyself, Lord
We remember Thee with love.",
"3": "By this bread which signifieth,
Thy one body mystical
We commune with all Thy members,
In one bond identical.
By this holy cup of blessing
Cup of wine which now we bless
Of Thy blood we have communion,
With all those who faith possess.",
"4": "Thou art our eternal portion
Here we take a sweet foretaste;
We are waiting for Thy kingdom
And Thy coming now we haste.
At Thy coming, in Thy kingdom
With all saints that overcome
We anew will feast upon Thee,
And Thy loving Bride become."}
