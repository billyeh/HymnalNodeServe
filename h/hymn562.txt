{"1": "Abiding, oh, so wondrous sweet,
I'm resting at the Savior's feet;
I trust in Him, I'm satisfied,
I'm resting in the Crucified.",
"chorus": "Abiding, abiding,
Oh! so wondrous sweet;
I'm resting, resting
At the Savior's feet.",
"2": "He speaks, and by His word is giv'n
His peace, a blessed gift of heav'n;
Not as the world He peace doth give,
'Tis through this hope my soul shall live.",
"3": "I live; not I; 'tis He alone
By whom the mighty work is done;
Dead to myself, alive to Him,
I count all loss His rest to gain.",
"4": "Now rest, my heart, the work is done,
I'm saved through the Eternal Son;
Let all my pow'rs my soul employ,
To tell the world my peace and joy."}
