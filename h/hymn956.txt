["1 Soon our Lord will come, the day is drawing nigh\nSound of His approaching we can hear.\nWatchful we must be and always on alert,\nThat the Lord our hearts with rapture cheer.", "chorus Glory! glory! Christ will come again!\nGlory! glory! We with Him shall reign!\nWith a glorious body, ever with the Lord\nSinging all His praise with glad accord.", "2 Soon our Lord will come, the Morning Star appear;\nNight is deep, and soon will dawn the day.\nNever with the current of the age we go\nThat from trials we'll be kept away.", "3 Soon our Lord will come His servants to reward;\nThose who love Him then the crown will share.\nWatchful we must be and treasure not the world\nLove and serve the Lord, His burden bear.", "4 Soon our Lord will come and in His kingdom reign;\nSatan will be bound, the world subdued.\nWe must fight the battle, overcome the foe\nOn His throne He then will us include."]
