{"1": "Soon our Lord will come, the day is drawing nigh
Sound of His approaching we can hear.
Watchful we must be and always on alert,
That the Lord our hearts with rapture cheer.",
"chorus": "Glory! glory! Christ will come again!
Glory! glory! We with Him shall reign!
With a glorious body, ever with the Lord
Singing all His praise with glad accord.",
"2": "Soon our Lord will come, the Morning Star appear;
Night is deep, and soon will dawn the day.
Never with the current of the age we go
That from trials we'll be kept away.",
"3": "Soon our Lord will come His servants to reward;
Those who love Him then the crown will share.
Watchful we must be and treasure not the world
Love and serve the Lord, His burden bear.",
"4": "Soon our Lord will come and in His kingdom reign;
Satan will be bound, the world subdued.
We must fight the battle, overcome the foe
On His throne He then will us include."}
