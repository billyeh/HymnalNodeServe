["1 Flow through me, Lord, a weak and earthly vessel,\nCleansed by Thy blood, and quickened at Thy call.\nFlow through me, Lord, all utterly abandoned,\nTo Thy dear service, great, or high, or small.", "2 Flow through me, Lord, with overflowing fulness,\nMake me to know Thine own deep love for souls.\nWork in me, Lord, the faith that moveth mountains,\nAs power, Almighty power, my being holds.", "3 Flow through me, Lord, till sin in all its blackness\nTo captives bound by Satan is revealed.\nFlow through me, Lord, till hearts are stricken, broken,\nAnd in Thy cleansing fountain saved and healed.", "4 Flow through me, Lord, till lagging souls are quickened,\nTill lives of failure sing the victory song,\nTill praise from lips long dumb and silent, open,\nAnd join with rapture earth's glad, cleansed throng.", "5 Flow through me, Lord, till waters from Thy fountain\nShall slake the thirst of souls in deserts drear.\nFlow through me, Lord, till arid places blossom\nWith roses fresh and sweet, and wondrous fair.", "6 Flow through me, Lord, set all my heart-strings thrilling,\nWith Thine own love, so matchless, perfect, free.\nFlow through me, Lord, till naught in earth or heaven,\nCan satisfy my being, Lord, but Thee."]
