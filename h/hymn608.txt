{"1": "What mystery, the Father, Son, and Spirit
In person three, in substance all are one.
How glorious, this God our being enters,
To be our all, thru Spirit in the Son!",
"chorus": "The Triune God has now become our all!
How wonderful! How glorious!
This Gift divine we never can exhaust!
How excellent! How marvelous!",
"2": "How rich the source, the Father as the fountain
And all this wealth He wants man to enjoy!
O blessed fact, this vast exhaustless portion,
Is now for us forever to employ!",
"3": "How wonderful, the Son is God's expression,
Come in the flesh to dwell with all mankind!
Redemption's work, how perfectly effective
That sinners we with God might oneness find.",
"4": "The Spirit is the Son's transfiguration,
Come into us as life the full supply.
Amazing fact, our spirit with the Spirit,
Now mingles and in oneness joins thereby!",
"5": "How real it is that God is now the Spirit,
For us to touch, experience day by day!
Astounding fact, with God we are one spirit
And differ not in life in any way!"}
