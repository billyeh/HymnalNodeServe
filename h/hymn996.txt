{"1": "Jesus, Savior, Son of God,
Bearer of the sinner's load,
Breaker of the captive's chain,
Cleanser of the guilty's stain.",
"2": "Thou the sinner's death hast died,
Thou for us wast crucified;
For our sins Thy flesh was torn,
Thou our penalty hast borne.",
"3": "Savior, Surety, Lamb of God,
Thou hast bought us with Thy blood;
Thou hast wiped the debt away,
Nothing left for us to pay;",
"4": "Nothing left for us to bear,
Nothing left for us to share
But the pardon and the bliss,
But the love, the light, the peace.",
"5": "I to Thee will look and live,
And, in looking, praises give;
Looking lightens, looking heals,
Looking all the gladness seals.",
"6": "Jesus, Savior, Son of God,
Bearer of the sinner's load,
I would rise to Thee above,
I would look, and praise, and love."}
