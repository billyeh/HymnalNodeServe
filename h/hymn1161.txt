{"1": "Christ will make His seeking lover
Pillar, couch, and palanquin,
E'en a crown, His boast and glory;
He will do it all! Amen!",
"chorus": "His beloved-how He loves her,
So attractive, His delight.
He is captivated wholly;
She is comely in His sight.",
"2": "But there still remains a shadow;
Christ is still not satisfied.
He must have a growing garden
To become His loving Bride!",
"3": "Paradise of pomegranates,
Pleasant fruits, and henna flowers,
Spikenard, saffron, myrrh, and aloes:
His enjoyment now-not ours.",
"4": "He has come into His garden,
Gathered myrrh and spices there,
Eaten honeycomb and honey;
Wine and milk He'll drink fore'er.",
"5": "From the garden comes the city,
All materials thus supplied;
God is satisfied completely,
And the foe is terrified.",
"6": ""Thou art fair, my love, as Tirzah,
Comely as Jerusalem."
O Lord Jesus, Hallelujah,
Thou wilt do it all! Amen!"}
