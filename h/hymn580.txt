["1 Resting on the faithfulness of Christ our Lord,\nResting on the fulness of His own sure word,\nResting on His wisdom, on His love and pow'r,\nResting on His covenant from hour to hour.", "2 Resting 'neath His guiding hand for untrack'd days,\nResting 'neath His shadow from the noontide rays,\nResting at the eventide beneath His wing,\nIn the glorious presence of our Savior King.", "3 Resting in the fortress while the foe is nigh,\nResting in the lifeboat while the waves roll high,\nResting in His chariot for the swift, glad race,\nResting, always resting, in His boundless grace.", "4 Resting in the pastures and beneath the Rock,\nResting by the waters where He leads His flock,\nResting, while we listen, at His glorious feet,\nResting in His very arms, oh, rest complete!", "5 Resting and believing, let us onward press;\nResting on Himself, the Lord our righteousness;\nResting and rejoicing, let His saved ones sing,\nGlory, glory, glory be to Christ our King!"]
