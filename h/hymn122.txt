["1 Thou, Lord, to death's domain\nDidst go alone.\nDeath had on Thee no claim,\nThou sinless One!\nHe who had death's dread pow'r\nMet Thee in that dark hour:\nVanquished by Thee his power,\nBy Thee alone.", "2 But Thou hast burst the grave,\nRisen art Thou;\nDeath could not Thee enslave,\nDeath had to bow!\nVictorious hast Thou come\nOut of the darksome tomb,\nBroken the bands of gloom:\nBeyond death now.", "3 What mighty triumphs, Lord,\nThou didst achieve!\nWhat fruitfulness doth God\nFrom Thee receive!\nOut of Thy death has sprung\nA wondrous living throng:\nAll, all to Thee belong,\nAnd in Thee live.", "4 Firstborn of all Thou art,\nLowly we bow;\nChief in Thy Father's heart-\nChief to us now.\nThou art indeed supreme,\nOur great eternal theme,\nWorthy of all esteem:\nWorthy art Thou!"]
