{"1": "The voice of my Beloved,
Behold, He quickly comes;
He leaps upon the mountains,
And o'er the hills He runs.
The signs of His appearing
Are seen on every side;
The Bridegroom soon is coming
To claim His loving Bride.",
"2": "How real that He is coming-
Come quickly, Lord, again!
We watch for His appearing,
His precious Word amen.
Oh, don't delay His coming,
Pray without ceasing, pray;
He's eagerly awaiting
That coming wedding day.",
"3": "He longs to hear our voices,
He longs to see our face-
Our voices filled with sweetness,
Our countenance with grace.
"Arise, My love, My fair one,
We long to hear Him say.
The voice of our Beloved-
"Arise and come away!"",
"4": "The winter rain is over,
The flowers appear on earth;
The rising sun of Jesus
Fills all our hearts with mirth.
It is the time of singing,
The turtle dove is heard;
For our Beloved's coming
The sweetest chords are stirred.",
"5": "Oh, let us take the foxes
That spoil the blooming vine;
Our vineyards are in blossom,
And all, Beloved, is Thine.
The day is quickly dawning,
The shadows flee away;
Upon the mount of spices
Our Lord may come today."}
