["1 The voice of my Beloved,\nBehold, He quickly comes;\nHe leaps upon the mountains,\nAnd o'er the hills He runs.\nThe signs of His appearing\nAre seen on every side;\nThe Bridegroom soon is coming\nTo claim His loving Bride.", "2 How real that He is coming-\nCome quickly, Lord, again!\nWe watch for His appearing,\nHis precious Word amen.\nOh, don't delay His coming,\nPray without ceasing, pray;\nHe's eagerly awaiting\nThat coming wedding day.", "3 He longs to hear our voices,\nHe longs to see our face-\nOur voices filled with sweetness,\nOur countenance with grace.\n\"Arise, My love, My fair one,\nWe long to hear Him say.\nThe voice of our Beloved-\n\"Arise and come away!\"", "4 The winter rain is over,\nThe flowers appear on earth;\nThe rising sun of Jesus\nFills all our hearts with mirth.\nIt is the time of singing,\nThe turtle dove is heard;\nFor our Beloved's coming\nThe sweetest chords are stirred.", "5 Oh, let us take the foxes\nThat spoil the blooming vine;\nOur vineyards are in blossom,\nAnd all, Beloved, is Thine.\nThe day is quickly dawning,\nThe shadows flee away;\nUpon the mount of spices\nOur Lord may come today."]
