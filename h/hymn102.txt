["1 We sing the praise of Him who died,\nOf Him who died upon the Cross;\nThe sinner's hope let men deride,\nFor this we count the world but loss.", "2 Inscribed upon the Cross we see\nIn shining letters, God is love!\nHe bears our sins upon the tree,\nHe brings us mercy from above.", "3 The Cross: \"it takes our guilt away;\nIt holds the fainting spirit up;\nIt cheers with hope the gloomy day,\nAnd sweetens every bitter cup.", "4 The balm of life, the cure of woe,\nThe measure and the pledge of love,\nThe sinner's refuge here below,\nThe angels' theme in heav'n above."]
