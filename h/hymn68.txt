{"1": "Lord, Thy Name is called Jesus
Wonderful is this dear Name;
Thou wast brought forth of the virgin
And the Son of man became.
Thou art our Jehovah-Savior
Saving us from all our sins;
When as Savior we receive Thee
Life divine in us begins.",
"2": "Thou as "Christ" art also titled
Title of Thy ministry;
Thou art truly God's anointed
Even from eternity.
Thou, O Lord, art God's Messiah;
God appointed Thee in love
That Thou might fulfill His purpose,
And to all His glory prove.",
"3": "Thou art also called "Emmanuel"
"God with us" Thou cam'st to be;
God in grace is wholly mingled,
With our own humanity.
God in flesh is manifested
Full of grace and truth therein;
We have seen in Thee God's glory
And in faith partake of Him.",
"4": "How we treasure all Thy names, Lord
How much they to us unfold;
All their worth and all their sweetness,
We in love will ever hold.
Precious Savior, we adore Thee
Worship unto Thee we bring;
Our Emmanuel we exalt Thee
And Thy praise will ever sing."}
