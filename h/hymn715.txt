["1 Not now, but in the coming years,\nIt may be when with Christ we stand,\nWe'll read the meaning of our tears,\nAnd there, sometime, we'll understand.", "chorus Then trust in God through all thy days;\nFear not, for He doth hold thy hand;\nThough dark thy way, still sing and praise,\nSometime, sometime, we'll understand.", "2 We'll catch the broken thread again,\nAnd finish what we here began;\nGod will the mysteries explain,\nAnd then, ah, then, we'll understand.", "3 We'll know why clouds instead of sun\nWere over many a cherished plan;\nWhy song has ceased when scarce begun;\n'Tis then, sometime, we'll understand.", "4 Why what we long for most of all,\nEludes so oft our eager hand;\nWhy hopes are crushed and castles fall,\nTill then, sometime, we'll understand.", "5 God knows the way, He holds the key,\nHe guides us with unerring hand;\nSometime with tearless eyes we'll see;\nYes, then, 'tis then, we'll understand."]
