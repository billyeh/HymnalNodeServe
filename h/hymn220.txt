{"1": "When on Thy table, Lord, we gaze
We marvel at the signs:
A loaf of bread, a cup of wine
Displayed as God designs.",
"2": "The loaf portrays the bread of life,
As heav'nly food to us
Imparted by Thy mystic death,
That we may share Thee thus.",
"3": "The portion is the cup divine
Composed of Jesus' blood;
This cup of blessing we receive,
And gain what is of God.",
"4": "We eat of Thee, the Bread of life
By sharing here this bread;
Thus we remember Thee in love,
And with Thyself are fed.",
"5": "We all enjoy the blessings gained,
By drinking of this cup;
Thus we remember Thee with joy
Till we are taken up.",
"6": "By feasting on this bread and cup,
Thy death we now declare
And testify Thou art our life,
And all we daily share.",
"7": "We're waiting for that glorious hour
When in the fullest way,
We'll feed on Thee and feast with Thee,
And worship Thee for aye."}
