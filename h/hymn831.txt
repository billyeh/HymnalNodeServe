{"1": "The unity of Church is but,
The saints in oneness living;
The Spirit which indwelleth them,
This oneness ever giving.
Thus it is realized and called,
The unity of Spirit;
'Tis based upon the common faith,
Which all the saints inherit.",
"2": "This precious faith of all the saints
Is constituted solely,
Of Christ and His redemptive work
Which are unique and holy.
In this the saints are truly one
Together all agreeing
And it is from this common faith,
The Church came into being.",
"3": "The Church within the universe,
Is one as Christ's possession;
The Church must therefore locally,
Be one in her expression;
For all her elements are one-
One God, one Lord, one Spirit
One faith, baptism, Body too
One hope all saints inherit.",
"4": "This oneness is the Church's ground
The ground of common standing
The only ground of unity,
The Spirit is demanding.
The Church in actual practise thus,
May keep her vital union
And her expressions locally,
Be built up in communion.",
"5": "Lord, help us ever strive to keep,
This unity by taking,
The Church's ground of unity
The Body-life partaking
That all Thy heart's profound desire,
May fully be effected
And God's eternal purpose may,
Completely be perfected."}
