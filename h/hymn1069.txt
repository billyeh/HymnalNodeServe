{"1": "We're feeding on the living Bread,
We're drinking at the fountainhead;
And whoso drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.",
"chorus": "What! never thirst again?
No, never thirst again!
What! never thirst again?
No, never thirst again!
And whoso drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again!"}
