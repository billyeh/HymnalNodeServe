{"nonum: "From the beachhead in our spirit
To our mind, emotion, will.
Christ will spread through all our being
And our vessel wholly fill.
He will cast out all rebellion,
Change our darkness into light.
Satan's kingdom will be swallowed,
And Christ will reign with might.
This is the Lord's recovery,
This is His very best!
Brothers, give the Lord the ground in you
Till His kingdom's manifest."}
