["nonum: \"From the beachhead in our spirit\nTo our mind, emotion, will.\nChrist will spread through all our being\nAnd our vessel wholly fill.\nHe will cast out all rebellion,\nChange our darkness into light.\nSatan's kingdom will be swallowed,\nAnd Christ will reign with might.\nThis is the Lord's recovery,\nThis is His very best!\nBrothers, give the Lord the ground in you\nTill His kingdom's manifest."]
