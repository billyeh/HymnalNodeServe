["1 When I fear my faith will fail,\nChrist will hold me fast;\nWhen the tempter would prevail,\nHe can hold me fast.", "chorus He will hold me fast,\nHe will hold me fast;\nFor my Savior loves me so,\nHe will hold me fast.", "2 I could never keep my hold,\nHe will hold me fast;\nFor my love is often cold,\nHe must hold me fast.", "3 I am precious in His sight,\nHe will hold me fast;\nThose He saves are His delight,\nHe will hold me fast.", "4 He'll not let my soul be lost,\nChrist will hold me fast;\nBought by Him at such a cost,\nHe will hold me fast."]
