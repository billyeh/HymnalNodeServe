["1 How we love the glorious name,\nThe name of Jesus!\n'Tis the name above all names-\nOn earth or in heav'n.\nAs we breathe this precious name,\nDarkness and death cannot remain;\nFor we call and get the Person of that name!", "2 Dear Lord Jesus, with our tongues-\nWe gladly confess Thy name,\nTo the glory of the Father God above.\nFor to us to speak Thy praise,\nIs the enjoyment of our days;\nCalling JESUS is to call the One we love!"]
