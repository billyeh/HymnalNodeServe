{"1": "What great provision God has made
In Jesus' death on Calvary!
I hung with Him upon the tree,
And in His tomb I too was laid.",
"2": "I rose with Him from out the grave-
And how shall I who died to sin
Continue still to live therein,
The victor living as the slave?",
"3": "At God's right hand He took His place,
And while for saints my Savior pleads,
My heart for sinners intercedes
That they might know His saving grace.",
"4": "Oh, what a name to me is given-
A son of God, by second birth!
I represent Him on the earth,
He represents me now in heaven.",
"5": "As Jesus dwells beyond the skies,
I dwell within this world of strife;
And as He lives within my life,
In Him I'm in the heavenlies!"}
