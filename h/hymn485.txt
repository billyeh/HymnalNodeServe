["1 What great provision God has made\nIn Jesus' death on Calvary!\nI hung with Him upon the tree,\nAnd in His tomb I too was laid.", "2 I rose with Him from out the grave-\nAnd how shall I who died to sin\nContinue still to live therein,\nThe victor living as the slave?", "3 At God's right hand He took His place,\nAnd while for saints my Savior pleads,\nMy heart for sinners intercedes\nThat they might know His saving grace.", "4 Oh, what a name to me is given-\nA son of God, by second birth!\nI represent Him on the earth,\nHe represents me now in heaven.", "5 As Jesus dwells beyond the skies,\nI dwell within this world of strife;\nAnd as He lives within my life,\nIn Him I'm in the heavenlies!"]
