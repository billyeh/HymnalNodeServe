{"1": "Lord Jesus, in Thy precious name,
And in that name alone;
At Thy request we gladly meet,
Thy Lordship here would own.",
"2": "As on that dark betrayal night,
Thou didst this feast ordain;
We too, the bread and cup would take,
Thy death, Lord, thus proclaim.",
"3": "The bread, Thy body doth portray;
The cup, Thy precious blood;
By which our sin was put away,
Our peace was made with God.",
"4": "The Host art Thou, O blessed Lord,
Thy honored guests are we;
With grateful and adoring hearts
We would remember Thee!",
"5": "Lord Jesus, whom unseen we love,
As thus we muse on Thee;
We none would see, save Thee alone,
Thou Man of Calvary!"}
