["1 Lord Jesus, in Thy precious name,\nAnd in that name alone;\nAt Thy request we gladly meet,\nThy Lordship here would own.", "2 As on that dark betrayal night,\nThou didst this feast ordain;\nWe too, the bread and cup would take,\nThy death, Lord, thus proclaim.", "3 The bread, Thy body doth portray;\nThe cup, Thy precious blood;\nBy which our sin was put away,\nOur peace was made with God.", "4 The Host art Thou, O blessed Lord,\nThy honored guests are we;\nWith grateful and adoring hearts\nWe would remember Thee!", "5 Lord Jesus, whom unseen we love,\nAs thus we muse on Thee;\nWe none would see, save Thee alone,\nThou Man of Calvary!"]
