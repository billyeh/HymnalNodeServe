["1 Lord, hast Thou not one word for me\nTo bind my soul more close to Thee,\nThat every evil I may flee;\nOne word, O Lord! one word from Thee?", "2 One word, to show how weak am I\nWhen in my strength alone I try,\nIn vain I toil, in vain I sigh;\nOne word, O Lord! one word from Thee.", "3 One word, to show how near Thou art,\nFor Thou dost dwell within my heart;\nAnd of Thy life I share a part;\nOne word, O Lord! one word from Thee.", "4 One word of power, oh, let me hear,\nAbove the heart's most anxious fear,\nThy still, small voice, yet deep and clear;\nOne word, O Lord! one word from Thee.", "5 One word of final triumph, Lord;\nSweet hope Thy promises afford,\nTo dwell with Thee in sweet accord;\nOne word, O Lord! one word from Thee."]
