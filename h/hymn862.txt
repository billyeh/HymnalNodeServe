{"1": "Jesus, where'er Thy people meet,
There they behold Thy mercy-seat;
Where'er they seek Thee, Thou art found,
With grace and mercy to abound.",
"2": "For Thou, within no walls confined,
Inhabitest the humble mind;
Such ever bring Thee where they come,
And going, take Thee to their home.",
"3": "Dear Shepherd of Thy chosen few,
Thy former mercies here renew;
Here, to our waiting hearts, proclaim
The sweetness of Thy saving Name.",
"4": "Here may we prove the power of prayer
To strengthen faith and sweeten care;
To teach our faint desires to rise,
And bring Thy light before our eyes.",
"5": "Lord, we are few, but Thou art near;
Nor short Thine arm, nor deaf Thine ear;
Oh, rend the heavens, come quickly down,
And make our waiting hearts Thine own.",
"6": "Command Thy blessing in this hour;
And as the Spirit full of pow'r
With life and vision fill this place,
That all Thy purpose we may trace.",
"7": "O Thou, our Head, our Life, our Guide,
May nought in life or death divide
The saints in Thy communion blessed,
That all Thy fulness be expressed."}
