{"1": "Christ is the Word and Spirit too
And as the Spirit in the Word;
And all the words He speaks to us,
Are life and spirit thus conferred.",
"2": "The Holy Word we have without
The Holy Spirit is within;
The greatest gifts divine are these
That we may God enjoy therein.",
"3": "The Word the Spirit doth express
The Spirit its reality;
They're but two aspects of one thing,
And should not separated be.",
"4": "Whene'er the Spirit lights the Word,
The Word becometh life to us;
When Word from Spirit is divorced
'Tis empty mental stimulus.",
"5": "When we the Word in spirit touch
As life the Spirit it becomes;
The Spirit, when expressed from us
As words of life to others comes.",
"6": "Our spirit we must exercise,
To take the Word most inwardly
And then to give the Spirit forth;
The two as one with us should be.",
"7": "Lord, may Thy Word in me become,
The Spirit as my life supply
And may Thy Spirit in Thy Word,
My true expression be thereby."}
