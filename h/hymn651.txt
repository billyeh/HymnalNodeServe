{"1": "When is the time to trust?
Is it when all is calm,
When waves the victor's palm,
And life is one glad psalm?
Nay! but the time to trust
Is when the waves beat high,
When storm clouds fill the sky,
And pray'r is one long cry.",
"2": "When is the time to trust?
Is it when friends are true?
Is it when comforts woo
In all we say and do?
Nay! but the time to trust
Is when we stand alone,
And summer birds have flown,
And every prop is gone.",
"3": "When is the time to trust?
Is it some future day,
When you have tried your way,
And learned to trust and pray?
Nay! but the time to trust
Is in this moment's need,
Poor, broken, bruised reed.
Poor, troubled soul, make speed!",
"4": "When is the time to trust?
Is it when hopes beat high,
When sunshine gilds the sky
With joy and ecstasy?
Nay! but the time to trust
Is when our joy has fled,
When sorrow bows the head,
And all is cold and dead."}
