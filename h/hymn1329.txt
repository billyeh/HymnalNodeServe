["1 The wedding feast, the peak of man's enjoyment\nWas full of pleasure till the wine ran dry.\nThe human life, like wine, is soon exhausted,\nTill Jesus comes, divine life to supply.", "chorus When Jesus comes, new wine is made from water,\nWhen Jesus comes, the darkness turns to light.\nHe touches death-it's turned to life eternal,\nWeakness to strength and blindness into sight.", "2 One night a moral righteous man, a ruler\nTo Jesus came, more teaching to pursue;\nBut teachings ne'er could change the fallen nature,\nSo Jesus said, \"You must be born anew.\"", "3 \"I have no husband,\" sighed the thirsty sinner.\nIndeed her many husbands left her dry.\nDaily she came to draw the failing water\nTill Jesus came, her thirst to satisfy.", "4 A man among the multitude lay helpless,\nSo weak while waiting till the water stirred.\nReligion of the law could never heal him;\nThen Jesus came and spoke the living word.", "5 Within the tomb, four days and nights he lay there,\nDeath's grip had come; they 'round the grave did weep.\nSilent he lay, all bound and wrapped in grave clothes;\nThen Jesus came, and woke him from his sleep.", "6 And still today, this Jesus is so living,\nAble to save from death in any form.\nNow open up your heart and call upon Him;\nTo you He'll come, in spirit you'll be born."]
