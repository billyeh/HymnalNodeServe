{"1": "What! Not sing of blood divine?
What! Not tell to all mankind?
What! Not speak to hearts unclean
Of the precious living stream.",
"2": "By this blood, God's life released,
Blood surpassing any beast's;
Perfect, spotless Lamb of God,
Incorruptible His blood.",
"3": "Voice it has, this holy blood;
Pow'r possessed to speak with God;
Speaks it for us at the throne
With its glorious virtue shown.",
"4": "Failure on our conscience is-
Conscience means a "knowing this"-
Causing us much grief and pain,
Telling us of every stain.",
"5": "All the while we're unaware
Of the blood's effectual prayer.
Jesus' blood speaks of our case,
That we might receive His grace!",
"6": "We need not dead works to bring,
Nor another offering.
Nothing else could please our God,
Heav'n is listening for His blood.",
"7": "In His blood forgiveness shines;
Oh, 'tis glorious to find!
Israel just atonement knew,
We have that and cleansing too.",
"8": "Heart and mind are now at peace
Rest! Our conscience has been reached.
Never more we blush in shame,
We are washed from every stain.",
"9": "Hallelujah! Fathomless!
All that's in His blood for us!
Sing we will, and sing we must;
In His blood is all our trust!"}
