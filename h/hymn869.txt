{"1": "Ere we depart, we praise Thee, Lord, again,
For Thy dear presence and Thy living word;
We are attracted by Thy preciousness
Our hearts incline to Thee through what we've heard.",
"2": "Thy word is spirit and is life to us
By it we're nourished, growing, Lord, in Thee;
Thus to Thine image we may be transformed
With Thy full measure to maturity.",
"3": "Impart Thyself to us, Lord, more and more
And make us in the spirit walk and move
That we be kept in fellowship with Thee
Until we meet again, Thy grace to prove."}
