["1 Fill Thou my life, O Lord my God,\nIn every part with praise,\nThat my whole being may proclaim\nThy being and Thy ways.", "2 Not for the lip of praise alone,\nNor e'en the praising heart,\nI ask, but for a life made up\nOf praise in every part:", "3 Praise in the common things of life,\nIts goings out and in;\nPraise in each duty and each deed,\nHowever small and mean.", "4 Fill every part of me with praise;\nLet all my being speak\nOf Thee and of Thy love, O Lord,\nPoor though I be and weak.", "5 So shall no part of day or night\nFrom sacredness be free,\nBut all my life, in every step,\nBe fellowship with Thee."]
