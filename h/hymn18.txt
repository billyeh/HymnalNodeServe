My Father God, art Thou;
The universe and all therein,
Thy faithfulness avow.",

For this I worship Thee;
It is established in the heav'n
And ever stands for me.",

Nor any change with Thee;
As Thou hast been, and now Thou art
Forever Thou wilt be.",

Can never pass away;
Though heav'n and earth shall disappear
Thy word abides for aye.",
"4": "Thy gifts without repentance are
Thy calling is the same;
Thy grace forever lasting is
Thy mercy as Thy name.",
"5": "Thy word with Thine own faithfulness,
A surety is to me;
By it, with Thy salvation true
I have the certainty.",
"6": "If, due to self, I trust Thee not
Yet Thou art faithful still;
Thou never canst deny Thyself
Thy word Thou shalt fulfill.",

Thy promise and Thy call;
So, feeding on Thy faithfulness
I take Thyself withal.",
"8": "The rainbow round about Thy throne,
Thy faithfulness declares;
This attribute forevermore,
The holy city bears."}
