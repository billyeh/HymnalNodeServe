{"1": "Glory be to Jesus,
Who in bitter pains
Poured for me the life-blood
From His sacred veins.",
"2": "Grace and life eternal
In that Blood I find;
Blest be His compassion,
Infinitely kind.",
"3": "Blest through endless ages
Be the precious stream,
Which from endless torments
Did the world redeem.",
"4": "Abel's blood for vengeance
Pleaded to the skies;
But the blood of Jesus
For our pardon cries.",
"5": "It the conscience sprinkles,
Frees our guilty hearts;
Satan in confusion
Terror-struck departs.",
"6": "Oft as earth exulting
Wafts its praise on high,
Angel-hosts rejoicing
Make their glad reply.",
"7": "Lift ye then your voices;
Swell the mighty flood;
Louder still and louder
Praise the precious blood."}
