["1 Lower and lower, dear Lord, at Thy feet,\nSeeking Thy Spirit, Thy mercy so sweet;\nDown in our need, blessed Master, we fall,\nLower and lower; be Thou all in all.", "chorus Lower and lower, down at Thy cross,\nAll the world's treasure counting but dross;\nDown at Thy feet, blessed Savior, we fall,\nLower, still lower, Christ all in all!", "2 Lower and lower, dear Savior, we pray,\nLosing the self-life still more every day;\nWeak and unworthy, we're looking above:\nEmpty us wholly; then fill us with love.", "3 Lower and lower; yet higher we rise\nLifted in Christ, freed from all the earth ties:\nHumbly we follow the way of the cross.\nThen, crowns of glory, and gain for all loss."]
