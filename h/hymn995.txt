{"1": "There is a green hill far away,
Without a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.",
"chorus": "Oh, dearly, dearly has He loved,
And died our sins to bear;
We trust in His redeeming blood,
And life eternal share.",
"2": "We may not know, we cannot tell,
What pains He had to bear;
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffered there.",
"3": "He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,
That we might from our sins be freed,
Saved by His precious blood.",
"4": "There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin,
He only could divine life give
And dwell Himself within."}
