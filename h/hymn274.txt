{"1": "O Lord, we seek the power we need;
We are so weak in word and in deed,
And in Thy service cannot proceed
Clothe us with pow'r we pray!",
"chorus": "We are waiting, and to Thee we bow
In Thy presence all our need avow;
Give us Thy power, give even now
Clothe us with pow'r today.",
"2": "Lord, come and visit us at this place
Grant to Thy Church the gifts of Thy grace
Fully with might our service embrace
Clothe us with pow'r we pray!",
"3": "Send us Thy power with its full sway
As Thou didst send on Pentecost day;
Answer our prayer and make no delay
Clothe us with pow'r we pray!",
"4": "Here, as Thy Body, Thy pow'r we claim;
Claiming by faith in Thy mighty Name
Thy heav'nly show'r with Thy heav'nly flame;
Clothe us with pow'r we pray!"}
