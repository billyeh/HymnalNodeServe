{"1": "Lord, in Thy presence silent I would be
That in the inmost I to Thee may come;
I would not in my own way pray to Thee
But let Thy prayer in me my prayer become.",
"2": "It seems Thou art in heaven hearing me
But right within my spirit Thou dost dwell;
It seems that I am praying unto Thee
But really from Thyself the prayers do well.",
"3": "When, Lord, no words my burden can express
My spirit with Thy Spirit deeply groans;
Not verbally I then my plea address
But Thou dost pray within with words unknown.",
"4": "I would inhale Thee, Lord, e'en as I breathe
And eat and drink Thee as my life supply.
A deeper fellowship with Thee bequeath,
That Thou express Thyself through me thereby.",
"5": "Here in this fellowship Thy light doth shine
Thy precious blood doth cleanse and make me clean;
May I not only, Lord, Thy light enshrine
But may Thou be expressed and clearly seen.",
"6": "Thy oil anoints me here in every way
Anointing Thee within unceasingly;
I more decrease, Thou more increase each day
Thus full expression Thou shalt have through me.",
"7": "Myself I open that Thou may flow in;
Op'ning myself to others, Lord, flow out;
By such a stream, the fellowship within
Thou, Lord, expressed will be my life throughout."}
