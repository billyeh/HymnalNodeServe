{"1": "How I love Thee, precious Jesus,
That Thy love laid hold of me;
Thou hast drawn and wooed and kissed me
That a lover I may be!",
"chorus": "Our Beloved, how we love Him,
So attractive, our delight.
We are captivated wholly
And are comely in His sight.",
"2": "As a company of horses,
Thou, O Lord, has likened me,
Strong and swift, with Pharaoh's chariots,
Full of natural energy.",
"3": "Just a lover with the dove's eyes
Fixed on Him and Him alone;
Changed are all my natural concepts,
Oh, the Lord in me has grown!",
"4": "Now a lily of the valley,
Standing out among the thorns,
In the Lord alone I'm trusting,
Of my self-strength I've been shorn.",
"5": "Make us doves that hide in Thee, Lord;
Bring us to the secret place.
There You find our voices sweet, Lord,
And desire to see our face.",
"6": "Make us then, Lord, smoking pillars,
Coming from the wilderness.
By Thy death and resurrection
All our natural will suppress.",
"7": "You desire a couch to rest on-
We become a rest to Thee;
Thou the Person in our being,
Gone our personality.",
"8": "Now a palanquin You're making-
Nothing natural You'll allow.
For Your move and Your expression
Start this work within us now!",
"9": "You supply the wood and pillars
For the structure and support,
Bottom gold and seat of purple
For our King of royal court.",
"10": "Only this, O Lord, we offer
For Thy palanquin so fine:

Just our love, so pure and fitted,
The interior design.",
"11": "What a sight when our Beloved
Wears a crown upon His brow;
Christ, the Church, are now united-
Boast and glory to Him now!"}
