That fellowship of love
His Spirit only can bestow,
Who reigns in light above.",

Thy heart made truly His;
Who dwells in cloudless light enshrined,
In whom no darkness is.",

Shall ne'er defile again;
The blood of Jesus Christ the Lord
Shall cleanse from every stain.",
"4": "Walk in the light, and e'en the tomb
No fearful shade shall wear;
The glory shall dispel the gloom,
For Christ hath conquered there.",
"5": "Walk in the light, and thou shalt own
Thy darkness passed away,
Because that light hath on thee shone
In which is Perfect day.",
"6": "Walk in the light, thy path shall be
Serene and clear and bright;
For God, by grace, shall dwell in thee,
And God Himself is Light."}
