["1 Christ, whose glory fills the skies\nChrist, the true, the only Light,\nSun of Righteousness, arise,\nTriumph o'er the shades of night;\nDayspring from on high, be near,\nDaystar, in my heart appear.", "2 Dark and cheerless is the morn\nUnaccompanied by Thee;\nJoyless is the day's return,\nTill Thy mercy's beams I see,\nTill Thou inward light impart,\nGlad my eyes, and warm my heart.", "3 Visit then this soul of mine,\nPierce the gloom of sin and grief;\nFill me, Radiancy divine,\nScatter all my unbelief;\nMore and more Thyself display,\nShining to the perfect day."]
