{"1": "As members of the Body,
Christ we would manifest
Each learning how to function,
His fulness to express;
We would not be spectators,
But each as members move
None bringing death or damage,
But each our profit prove.",
"2": "As in a team we'd never,
Act independently
But in coordination
Each would dependent be;
Not acting by our choosing,
But following the flow
Distraction never bringing
The Spirit's way we'd know.",
"3": "On Christ we here would focus
No other center make;
With Christ in sweet communion,
His riches to partake.
He is our Head and content
His Body we express;
Whate'er we do while meeting,
Himself must manifest.",
"4": "Built up in love together
Not one would criticize;
To perfect one another
We all would exercise.
Each one from self delivered
The natural life forsakes;
In grace each trained in spirit,
The Body-life partakes."}
