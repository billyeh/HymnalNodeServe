{"1": "By the cross discern the spirit
Put the soul to death alway;
Bear the cross, deny the self-life
Walk in spirit day by day.",
"2": "By the cross discern the spirit
Through the living Word of God
Separating soul from spirit
That the right path may be trod.",
"3": "By the cross discern the spirit
With the mind by light renewed
All emotion consecrated
And the will in love subdued.",
"4": "By the cross discern the spirit;
Passing thru the riven veil
Flesh and soul are wholly broken
And the spirit doth prevail.",
"5": "By the cross discern the spirit
'Tis the holiest place divine;
There commune with God in spirit,
And His presence will be thine.",
"6": "By the cross discern the spirit,
And the Jordan River cross;
Enter then the Land of Canaan
And enjoy Christ thru the cross.",
"7": "By the cross discern the spirit,
And within the spirit move;
As good land, on Christ e'er labor
And His riches thou wilt prove."}
