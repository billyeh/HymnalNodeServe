["1 O Holy Father, who in tender love\nDidst give Thine only Son for us to die,\nThe while He pleads at Thy right hand above,\nWe in one Spirit now with faith draw nigh;\nAnd, as we eat this bread and drink this wine,\nPlead His once offered sacrifice Divine.", "2 We are not worthy to be called Thy sons,\nNor gather up the fragments of Thy feast;\nYet look on us, Thy sorrowing contrite ones,\nOn us in Him our Advocate and Priest,\nWhose robe is fringed with mercy's golden bells,\nWhose breastplate fathomless compassion tells.", "3 Oh, hear us, for Thou always hearest Him;\nBehold us sprinkled with His precious blood;\nAnd from between the shadowing cherubim\nShine forth, and grant us by this heav'nly food\nForetastes of coming glory, and meanwhile\nA Father's blessing and a Father's smile.", "4 And, Father, ere we leave Thy mercy-throne,\nBound by these sacred pledges, yet most free,\nWe give our hearts, and not our hearts alone,\nBut all we are and all we have to Thee;\nGlad free-will offerings all our pilgrim days,\nHereafter an eternity of praise."]
