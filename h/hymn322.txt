["1 Many weary years I vainly sought a spring,\nOne that never would run dry;\nUnavailing all that earth to me could bring,\nNothing seemed to satisfy.", "chorus Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,\nDrinking at the Fountain of life am I;\nFinding joy and pleasure\nIn abounding measure,\nI am drinking at the Fountain of life.", "2 Through the desert land of sin I roam no more,\nFor I find a living Spring\nAnd my cup of gladness now is running o'er,\nJesus is my Lord and King.", "3 Here is sweet contentment as the days go by,\nHere is holy peace and rest;\nHere is consolation as the moments fly,\nHere my heart is always blest.", "4 Here I find a never ending, sure supply,\nWhile the endless ages roll;\nTo this healing Fountain I would ever fly,\nThere to bathe my weary soul."]
