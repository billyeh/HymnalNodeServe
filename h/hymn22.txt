{"1": "Holy Father, we adore Thee
Rev'rent song to Thee we raise;
Thou art holy, Thou art lofty
"Holy is Thy Name, we praise.",
"2": "Loving is Thy heart, dear Father
Righteous ever are Thy ways;
But how holy is Thy nature
Yet, to us Christ it conveys.",
"3": "Thou hast ever sanctified us,
With the blood of Christ our Lord;
Thou hast separated sinners,
Thru the truth which is Thy Word.",
"4": "Thou hast, by Thy Holy Spirit
Made us holy unto Thee;
And our spirit, soul, and body,
Wholly sanctified will be.",
"5": "Oh! the holy life of Jesus,
Thru Thy grace we now possess;
Thou wilt make us e'en partakers,
Of Thy very holiness.",
"6": "When within that holy city
Thy full holiness we'll share
To the uttermost forever
"Thou art holy, we'll declare."}
