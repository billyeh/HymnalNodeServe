["1 Once I stood in condemnation,\nWaiting thus the sinner's doom;\nChrist in death has wrought salvation,\nGod has raised Him from the tomb.\nOnce I was to God a stranger,\nFilled with enmity and fear;\nHe has rescued me from danger,\nLove revealed and brought me near.\nHe has rescued me from danger,\nLove revealed and brought me near.", "2 Now I see in Christ's acceptance\nBut the measure of my own;\nHe who lay beneath my sentence,\nSeated high upon the Throne.\nQuickened, raised, and in Him seated,\nI a full deliverance know;\nEvery foe has been defeated,\nEvery enemy laid low,\nEvery foe has been defeated,\nEvery enemy laid low.", "3 Now I have a life in union\nWith the risen Lord above;\nNow I drink in sweet communion\nSome rich foretaste of His love.\nSoon, O Lord! in highest glory,\nAll its vastness I'll explore;\nSoon I'll cast my crown before Thee,\nWhile I worship and adore,\nSoon I'll cast my crown before Thee,\nWhile I worship and adore."]
