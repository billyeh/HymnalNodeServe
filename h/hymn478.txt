{"1": "Once I stood in condemnation,
Waiting thus the sinner's doom;
Christ in death has wrought salvation,
God has raised Him from the tomb.
Once I was to God a stranger,
Filled with enmity and fear;
He has rescued me from danger,
Love revealed and brought me near.
He has rescued me from danger,
Love revealed and brought me near.",
"2": "Now I see in Christ's acceptance
But the measure of my own;
He who lay beneath my sentence,
Seated high upon the Throne.
Quickened, raised, and in Him seated,
I a full deliverance know;
Every foe has been defeated,
Every enemy laid low,
Every foe has been defeated,
Every enemy laid low.",
"3": "Now I have a life in union
With the risen Lord above;
Now I drink in sweet communion
Some rich foretaste of His love.
Soon, O Lord! in highest glory,
All its vastness I'll explore;
Soon I'll cast my crown before Thee,
While I worship and adore,
Soon I'll cast my crown before Thee,
While I worship and adore."}
