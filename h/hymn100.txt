["1 The Maker of the universe\nAs Man, for man was made a curse.\nThe claims of law which He had made,\nUnto the uttermost He paid.", "2 His holy fingers made the bough\nWhich grew the thorns that crowned His brow.\nThe nails that pierced His hands were mined\nIn secret places He designed.", "3 He made the forest whence there sprung\nThe tree on which His body hung.\nHe died upon a cross of wood,\nYet made the hill on which it stood.", "4 The sky that darkened o'er His head\nBy Him above the earth was spread.\nThe sun that hid from Him its face\nBy His decree was poised in space.", "5 The spear which spilled His precious blood\nWas tempered in the fires of God.\nThe grave in which His form was laid,\nWas hewn in rocks His hands had made.", "6 The throne on which He now appears\nWas His from everlasting years.\nBut a new glory crowns His brow.\nAnd every knee to Him shall bow."]
