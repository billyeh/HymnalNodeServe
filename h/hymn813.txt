{"1": "I come before Thy throne of grace,
With hungry heart on Thee to feed
Thy grace and mercy to receive,
To help me in this hour of need.",
"2": "Here I behold Thy radiant face
Its light upon my heart doth shine,
With healing rays consuming all,
The weaknesses and faults of mine.",
"3": "'Tis here Thy light illuminates,
My true condition unto me;
'Tis here Thy blood's effectiveness,
To cleanse from sin I gladly see.",
"4": "Thy Spirit too anoints me here,
And makes Thy very substance mine;
Thy very self I thus enjoy,
And know Thy very heart's design.",
"5": "Thy Word I read before Thee here,
E'en as the priests the lamp did light;
Thy Spirit is as oil to me,
To light Thy Word and give me sight.",
"6": "E'en as the priests the incense burned
In prayer to Thee I persevere;
As incense Thou the Spirit art,
Mixed with the prayer I offer here.",
"7": "Thy Word is light, Thy Word is food;
Which doth enlighten and supply;
I long to read and feed much more
For light and food to satisfy.",
"8": "Thou art the living water too,
Which full revival doth bestow;
I wish to pray and drink e'en more,
That through me living rivers flow.",
"9": "Thou art the incense unto God
In Thee acceptance is complete;
I want to pray yet more and more
To offer up this fragrance sweet.",
"10": "By reading I'm enlightened, filled
By prayer my thirst is quenched indeed;
Thus Thou to me may be supplied
And Thou through me may meet the need.",
"11": "I long to have such fellowship,
To read and pray and blend with Thee;
I long that Thou wouldst saturate,
Till Thou may overflow from me."}
