{"1": "Thou art God's testimony, Lord
Much better than the law;
The law in letter was engraved
In it Thy type men saw.
A definition was the law
God's picture to provide;
But Thou art God's reality
In Thee doth God abide.",
"2": "The ark of testimony too,
Was but a type of Thee;
In it the law of God was placed
But God in Thee we see.
The ark, in type, was made of wood,
And overlaid with gold;
It typifies Thee as a man
Who God in full doth hold.",
"3": "Thou art the tabernacle too
God's holy dwelling place;
Incarnate in the flesh Thou art
And full of truth and grace.
God's glory we behold in Thee
Thou art the Word divine;
Thy words and deeds of love and light,
Do God in life define.",
"4": "The temple was a type of Thee;
The house of God Thou art;
God dwells in Thee, Himself to show
His fulness to impart.
Though Thou by Satan wast destroyed,
And numbered with the dead
In resurrection Thou dost build,
A larger one instead.",
"5": "The city shows Thy fulness true
A figure of Thy Bride
The increase of Thyself in full
In whom Thou dost abide.
In Thee is God, the light divine
The lamp in her art Thou;
With Thee God shines thru her on all
His glory to avow.",
"6": "The tabernacle and the ark
The law within them stored
The temple and the city too
Are all Thyself, dear Lord.
Thou art the hub, Thou art the rim
The all in all Thou art!
In Thee we see both God and man
How precious to our heart!"}
