["1 Thou art God's testimony, Lord\nMuch better than the law;\nThe law in letter was engraved\nIn it Thy type men saw.\nA definition was the law\nGod's picture to provide;\nBut Thou art God's reality\nIn Thee doth God abide.", "2 The ark of testimony too,\nWas but a type of Thee;\nIn it the law of God was placed\nBut God in Thee we see.\nThe ark, in type, was made of wood,\nAnd overlaid with gold;\nIt typifies Thee as a man\nWho God in full doth hold.", "3 Thou art the tabernacle too\nGod's holy dwelling place;\nIncarnate in the flesh Thou art\nAnd full of truth and grace.\nGod's glory we behold in Thee\nThou art the Word divine;\nThy words and deeds of love and light,\nDo God in life define.", "4 The temple was a type of Thee;\nThe house of God Thou art;\nGod dwells in Thee, Himself to show\nHis fulness to impart.\nThough Thou by Satan wast destroyed,\nAnd numbered with the dead\nIn resurrection Thou dost build,\nA larger one instead.", "5 The city shows Thy fulness true\nA figure of Thy Bride\nThe increase of Thyself in full\nIn whom Thou dost abide.\nIn Thee is God, the light divine\nThe lamp in her art Thou;\nWith Thee God shines thru her on all\nHis glory to avow.", "6 The tabernacle and the ark\nThe law within them stored\nThe temple and the city too\nAre all Thyself, dear Lord.\nThou art the hub, Thou art the rim\nThe all in all Thou art!\nIn Thee we see both God and man\nHow precious to our heart!"]
