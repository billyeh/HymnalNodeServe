["1 The queen in gold of Ophir\nAt Thy right hand doth stand;\nKing's daughters are the women\nWho fill Thy honored band.\nThe church in all her glory\nShall match her glorious King,\nAnd all the saints, the women,\nThy likeness there shall bring.", "2 O daughter, now consider,\nE'en now incline thine ear:\nRemember not thy people\nAnd all thine own things here.\nThy beauty then shall blossom-\n'Twill be the King's desire;\nFor He thy worthy Lord is,\nThy worship to inspire.", "3 The daughter's glorious garments\nAre made of inwrought gold-\nWithin the inner palace,\nHow wondrous to behold!\nThe glory of God's nature\nIs given her to wear,\nThat all His holy being\nShe may in life declare.", "4 In clothing too embroidered\nShe'll to the King be led,\nIn that fine linen garment\nTo be exhibited.\n'Tis by the Spirit's stitching\nThat Christ in us is wrought,\nAnd with this glorious garment\nWe'll to the King be brought.", "5 What gladness and rejoicing\nWhen we the King shall see!\nWe'll shout His worthy praises\nThrough all eternity.\nAnd though the King we worship\nOr glory in the Queen,\nIn all this blest enjoyment\nThe glory goes to Him."]
