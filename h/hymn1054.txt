Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.",
"chorus": "Savior, Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.",
"2": "Let me at Thy throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.",
"3": "Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.",
"4": "Thou the spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heaven but Thee?"}
