["1 Jesus, cast a look on me;\nGive me sweet simplicity;\nMake me poor, and keep me low,\nSeeking only Thee to know.", "2 Weaned from all my lordly self,\nWeaned from all the miser's pelf,\nWeaned from all the scorner's ways,\nWeaned from all the lust of praise.", "3 All that feeds my busy pride,\nCast it evermore aside;\nBid my will to Thine submit,\nLay me humbly at Thy feet.", "4 Make me like a little child,\nOf my strength and wisdom spoiled;\nSeeing only in Thy light,\nWalking only in Thy might;", "5 Leaning on Thy loving breast,\nWhere a weary soul may rest;\nFeeling well the peace of God\nFlowing from Thy precious blood.", "6 In this posture let me live,\nAnd hosannas daily give;\nIn this temper let me die,\nAnd hosannas ever cry."]
