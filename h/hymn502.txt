["1 Once I was dead in sin,\nAnd hope within me died;\nBut now I'm dead to sin,\nWith Christ I'm crucified.", "chorus And can it be that \"He loved me,\nAnd gave Himself for me\"?", "2 O height I cannot reach!\nO depth I cannot sound!\nO love, O boundless love,\nIn my Redeemer found!", "3 I live-and yet not I,\nBut Christ that lives in me,\nWho from the law of sin\nAnd death has made me free."]
