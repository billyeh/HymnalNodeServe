{"1": "Thou art the Son beloved
The image of our God;
Thou art the saints' dear portion
Imparted thru Thy blood.
Among all God's creation,
Thou art the firstborn One;
By Thee all was created
All for Thyself to own.",
"2": "Thou art before all creatures
In Thee all things consist;
Of all Thou art the center
By Thee all things subsist.
Thou art the sole beginning
The Firstborn from the dead;
And for the Church, Thy Body
Thou art the glorious Head.",
"3": "Because it pleased the Father
All fulness dwells in Thee
That Thou might have the first place,
In all we ever see.
All things Thou reconciledst,
To God by Thy shed blood
To thus present us holy,
And blameless unto God.",
"4": "In Thee God's fulness dwelleth
Thou art God's mystery;
The treasures of all wisdom,
And knowledge are in Thee.
Thou art the hope of glory
In us Thou dost abide;
In Thee we are perfected,
And God is satisfied.",
"5": "All things are but a shadow,
Which unto us reveal,
Thyself, in whom we're rooted
The only One that's real.
Enjoying all Thy riches
Thy fulness we will be;
We'll hold Thee, as Thy Body
And grow with God in Thee.",
"6": "With Thee in God we're hidden
Thou art in us our life;
Thy peace in us presiding
We rest from all our strife.
In the new man, Thy Body
Thou art the all in all;
Our all-inclusive Savior
Thyself we'll ever call."}
