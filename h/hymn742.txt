{"1": "Man is a being of three parts
The body, soul, and spirit too
Th' eternal purpose to fulfill,
With God's inheritance in view.",
"2": "The body is the outward part,
That man a world-sense may possess;
Thus he may touch the outward things,
And bodily himself express.",
"3": "The soul within-the inward part-
Is but the very self of man;
The sense of self it gives to him,
To touch the psychic world of man.",
"4": "The spirit is the inmost part,
With which the Lord he may receive;
The sense of God it gives to man,
That he the spirit-world perceive.",
"5": "Within the soul of man there are,
The mind, emotion, and the will;
These are the functions for the man,
His human nature to fulfill.",
"6": "Within the spirit of the man,
Are found the conscience, fellowship
And intuition, which thereby,
The man to worship God equip.",
"7": "The man must exercise his soul,
To choose that God he may possess
And by his spirit God partake
And thru his body God express.",
"8": "Man's spirit has to be reborn,
With life divine to him conveyed;
His soul must be transformed by God
His body like Christ's body made.",
"9": "'Tis by these steps of work divine,
In each of man's three separate parts,
That man is mingled with the Lord,
And His expression full imparts."}
