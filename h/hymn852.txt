{"1": "Thy dwelling-place, O Lord, I love;
It is Thy Church so blessed
It is Thy joy and heart's delight,
And where Thy heart finds rest.",
"2": "For her, Thyself Thou gavest, Lord
That she be Thine, complete;
For her, I too my body give
Thy heart's desire to meet.",
"3": "For her, Thou hast become my life
That she my living be;
For her, I would forsake myself
That she be filled with Thee.",
"4": "The Church is Thy beloved Bride
Thou in Thy Body seen;
She is my joy and heart's desire
The one on whom I lean.",
"5": "In her, Thy full supply, O Lord
Thou dost to me impart;
In her am I possessed by Thee,
To satisfy Thy heart.",
"6": "Thy dwelling-place, O Lord, I love;
It is Thy Church, Thy home;
In it I would forever live,
And never longer roam."}
