{"1": "In the mighty Name of Jesus,
When we bow before the throne,
Many deadly foes are vanquished,
Many victories are won.",
"chorus": "Mighty Name! Mighty Name!
In that Name alone we win.
Mighty Name! Mighty Name!
Conquering Satan, death and sin.",
"2": "When we plead the Name of Jesus,
Satan and his hosts must flee.
Jesus! Jesus! Precious Jesus!
In Thy Name is victory.",
"3": "Soon shall come the blessed moment
When the battle shall be won,
When the Mighty Name of Jesus
Shall exalt us to the throne."}
