["1 In the mighty Name of Jesus,\nWhen we bow before the throne,\nMany deadly foes are vanquished,\nMany victories are won.", "chorus Mighty Name! Mighty Name!\nIn that Name alone we win.\nMighty Name! Mighty Name!\nConquering Satan, death and sin.", "2 When we plead the Name of Jesus,\nSatan and his hosts must flee.\nJesus! Jesus! Precious Jesus!\nIn Thy Name is victory.", "3 Soon shall come the blessed moment\nWhen the battle shall be won,\nWhen the Mighty Name of Jesus\nShall exalt us to the throne."]
