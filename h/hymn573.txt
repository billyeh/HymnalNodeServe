{"1": "Once I thought I walked with Jesus,
Yet such changeful feelings had;
Sometimes trusting, sometimes doubting,
Sometimes joyful, sometimes sad.",
"chorus": "Oh, the peace the Savior gives!
Peace I never knew before;
And my way has brighter grown
Since I've learned to trust Him more.",
"2": "But He call'd me closer to Him,
Bade my doubting, fearing, cease;
And when I had fully yielded,
Filled my soul with perfect peace.",
"3": "Now I'm trusting every moment,
Nothing less can be enough;
And the Savior bears me gently
O'er those places once so rough.",
"4": "Day by day my soul He's keeping
By His wondrous power within;
And my heart is full of singing
To my Savior from all sin."}
