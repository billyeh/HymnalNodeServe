{"1": "In Eden's garden fair we see,
That God before two trees placed man
The trees of life, and knowledge too
Which for the Lord and Satan stand.",
"2": "The tree of life the center is,
Of God's eternal, perfect plan
Denoting God in Christ as life,
To be received as all by man.",
"3": "The tree of knowledge standing there
Bespeaks a sure and warning voice:
Outside of God there is a source,
Of death to all who make this choice.",
"4": "If man would eat the tree of life
Then God as life he will receive
And be transformed to precious stones
God's will and Purpose to achieve.",
"5": "If man the tree of knowledge takes
Then Satan enters into man,
As sin, which brings him into death
That he may not fulfill God's plan.",
"6": "This signifies that only God,
Is our full source of life and breath;
To touch ought else is but to touch,
The source of knowledge and of death.",
"7": "For knowledge only bringeth death
Though evil or though good it seem;
For any thing apart from God
Is but the fruit of Satan's scheme.",
"8": "Not only evil, but the good,
Is contradictory to Christ;
Not only knowledge of the bad
But even good is versus Christ.",
"9": "Lord, teach us only Thee to touch
That with Thy life we filled may be
And not to touch the good or bad
Or anything apart from Thee."}
