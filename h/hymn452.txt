["1 Tell me not of earthly pleasures,\nTempt me not with sordid gain;\nMock me not with earth's illusions,\nVex me not with honors vain.\nI am weaned from sinful idols;\nI am henceforth not my own;\nI have giv'n my heart to Jesus,\nI belong to Him alone.", "chorus I am not my own,\nI am not my own.\nI belong to Jesus,\nAnd I am not my own.", "2 Oh, the blessed rest it brings us\nTo belong to Christ alone;\nWe can draw on all His fulness\nWhen we've nothing of our own.\nBlessed Jesus, take me, own me,\nMake me, keep me wholly Thine.\nDeign to find in me Thy portion,\nWhile I joy to call Thee mine.", "3 Weary soul, give up the struggle,\nCease at length thyself to own;\nGive yourself away to Jesus,\nAnd belong to Him alone.\nOnce He gave His all to win thee,\nNow He asks as much of thee;\nAll He has He fully gives thee;\nLet thy love His portion be."]
