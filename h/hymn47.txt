["1 Father, Thy name our souls would bless,\nAs children taught by grace,\nLift up our hearts in righteousness,\nAnd joy before Thy face.", "2 Sweet is the confidence Thou giv'st,\nThough high above our praise;\nOur hearts resort to where Thou liv'st\nIn heaven's unclouded rays.", "3 Eternal ages shall declare\nThe riches of Thy grace,\nTo those who with Thy Son shall share\nA son's eternal place.", "4 Absent as yet, we rest in hope,\nTreading the desert path,\nWaiting for Him who takes us up\nBeyond the pow'r of death.", "5 We joy in Thee, Thy fulness shall\nOur endless portion be,\nLike Thine own Son, with whom we'll dwell\nIn bright eternity.", "6 O Holy Father, keep us here\nIn that blest name of love,\nWalking before Thee without fear,\nThy perfect will to prove."]
