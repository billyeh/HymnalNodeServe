{"1": "Father, Thy name our souls would bless,
As children taught by grace,
Lift up our hearts in righteousness,
And joy before Thy face.",
"2": "Sweet is the confidence Thou giv'st,
Though high above our praise;
Our hearts resort to where Thou liv'st
In heaven's unclouded rays.",
"3": "Eternal ages shall declare
The riches of Thy grace,
To those who with Thy Son shall share
A son's eternal place.",
"4": "Absent as yet, we rest in hope,
Treading the desert path,
Waiting for Him who takes us up
Beyond the pow'r of death.",
"5": "We joy in Thee, Thy fulness shall
Our endless portion be,
Like Thine own Son, with whom we'll dwell
In bright eternity.",
"6": "O Holy Father, keep us here
In that blest name of love,
Walking before Thee without fear,
Thy perfect will to prove."}
