{"1": "Just one touch as He moves along,
Pushed and pressed by the jostling throng,
Just one touch and the weak was strong,
Cured by the Healer divine.",
"chorus": "Just one touch as He passes by,
He will list to the faintest cry.
Come and be cured while the Lord is nigh,
Christ is the Healer divine.",
"2": "Just one touch! and He makes me whole,
Speaks sweet peace to my sin-sick soul,
At His feet all my burdens roll,
Cured by the Healer divine.",
"3": "Just one touch! and the work is done,
I am cured by the blessed Son,
I will sing while the ages run,
Cured by the Healer divine.",
"4": "Just one touch! and He turns to me,
O the love in His eyes I see!
I am His for He hears my plea,
Cured by the Healer divine.",
"5": "Just one touch! by His mighty power
He can heal thee this very hour,
Thou canst hear though the tempests low'r,
Cured by the Healer divine."}
