["1 Be not dismayed whate'er betide,\nGod will take care of you!\nBeneath His wings of love abide,\nGod will take care of you!", "chorus God will take care of you,\nThrough every day o'er all the way;\nHe will take care of you;\nGod will take care of you!", "2 Through days of toil when heart doth fail,\nGod will take care of you!\nWhen dangers fierce your path assail,\nGod will take care of you!", "3 All you may need He will provide,\nGod will take care of you!\nTrust Him, and you will be satisfied,\nGod will take care of you!", "4 Lonely and sad, from friends apart,\nGod will take care of you!\nHe will give peace to your aching heart,\nGod will take care of you!", "5 No matter what may be the test,\nGod will take care of you!\nLean, weary one, upon His breast,\nGod will take care of you!"]
