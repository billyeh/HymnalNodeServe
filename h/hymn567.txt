{"1": "O Lamb of God, still keep me
Close to Thy wounded side;
'Tis only there in safety
And peace I can abide.",
"2": "What foes and snares surround me,
What lusts and fears within;
The grace that sought and found me
Alone can keep me clean.",
"3": "'Tis only in Thee hiding
I feel myself secure;
Only in Thee abiding,
The conflict can endure;",
"4": "Thine arm the victory gaineth
O'er every hateful foe;
Thy love my heart sustaineth
In all its care and woe.",
"5": "Soon shall my eyes behold Thee,
With rapture face to face;
One half hath not been told me
Of all Thy power and grace;",
"6": "Thy beauty, Lord, and glory,
The wonders of Thy love,
Shall be the endless story
Of all Thy saints above."}
