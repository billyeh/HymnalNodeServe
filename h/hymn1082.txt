["1 The living of Christ when He sojourned on earth,\nThe sixteenth Psalm shows us, was wholly of worth.\nHis attitudes, choices, and interests all tell\nThe man who in God's tabernacle may dwell.", "2 \"Preserve me, O God, for in Thee I confide\"-\nIn God He took refuge whate'er did betide.\n\"O Thou art my Lord, I've no good beyond Thee\"-\nHe spoke in Himself unto God constantly.", "3 \"As for all the saints who are dwelling on earth,\"\nTo Him they're the people of excellent worth.\nOf them He has said He has all His delight-\nIn proving this all the four Gospels unite.", "4 \"The Lord is my portion, the Lord is my cup\"-\nFor everything He to the Father looked up.\n\"The Lord I will bless who my counsel doth give\"-\nHimself He denied and by God's word did live.", "5 His heart thus was glad and His spirit rejoiced,\nAnd e'en in His death praise to God could be voiced;\nHis soul God would never abandon to hell,\nBut in resurrection His body would dwell.", "6 God raised Him, and He with God's glory was crowned;\nThen fulness of joy in God's presence He found.\nE'en now at the Father's right hand is His seat,\nWhere flowing forever are pleasures complete."]
