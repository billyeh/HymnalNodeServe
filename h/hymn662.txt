["1 \"On toward the goal!\" Press on!\nAlone, yet unafraid;\nHe cut the path, who beckons thee,\nOn then, and undismayed.", "2 \"On toward the goal!\" Press on!\nThe eyes that are a flame\nAre watching thee, what then are men?\nWhat matter praise, or blame?", "3 \"On toward the goal!\" Press on!\nLook not behind thee now,\nWhen just ahead lies His \"Well done,\"\nAnd crowns await thy brow.", "4 \"On toward the goal!\" Press on!\nBlind, deaf and sometimes dumb\nAlong the blood-marked, uphill way,\nHard after Christ, press on!"]
