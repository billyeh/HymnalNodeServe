["1 Come, let us all unite to sing,\nGod is love, God is love.\nLet heav'n and earth their praises bring;\nGod is love, God is love.\nLet ev'ry soul from sin awake,\nEach in his heart sweet music make,\nAnd sing with us, for Jesus' sake,\nGod is love! God is love!", "2 How happy is our portion here!\nGod is love, God is love.\nHis promises our spirits cheer;\nGod is love, God is love.\nHe is our sun and shield by day,\nOur help, our hope, our strength, and stay,\nHe will be with us all the way:\nGod is love! God is love!", "3 In glory we shall sing again,\nGod is love, God is love.\nYes, this shall be our lofty strain,\nGod is love, God is love.\nWhile endless ages roll along,\nIn concert with the heav'nly throng,\nThis shall be still our sweetest song,\nGod is love! God is love!"]
