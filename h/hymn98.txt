["1 Jesus! Source of life eternal!\nJesus, Author of our breath!\nVictor o'er the hosts infernal,\nBy defeat, and shame, and death,\nThou through deepest tribulation\nDeigned to pass for our salvation:\nThousand, thousand praises be,\nLord of glory, unto Thee!", "2 Thou, O Son of God! wert bearing\nCruel mockings, hatred, scorn;\nThou, the King of glory, wearing,\nFor our sake, the crown of thorn:\nDying, Thou didst us deliver\nFrom the chains of sin for ever;\nThousand, thousand praises be,\nPrecious Savior, unto Thee!", "3 All the shame men heaped upon Thee,\nThou didst patiently endure;\nNot the pains of death too bitter,\nOur redemption to procure:\nWondrous Thy humiliation\nTo accomplish our salvation:\nThousand, thousand praises be,\nPrecious Savior. unto Thee!", "4 Heart-felt praise and adoration,\nSavior, thus to Thee we give:\nFor Thy life's humiliation,\nFor Thy death, whereby we live;\nAll the grief Thou wert enduring,\nAll the bliss Thou wert securing,\nEvermore the theme shall be,\nOf thanksgivings, Lord, to Thee."]
