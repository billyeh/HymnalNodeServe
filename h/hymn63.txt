{"1": "Praise to the Holiest in the height,
And in the depth be praise:
In all His words most wonderful;
Most sure in all His ways.",
"2": "O loving wisdom of our God,
When all was sin and shame,
He, the last Adam, to the fight
And to the rescue came.",
"3": "O wisest love! that flesh and blood
Which did in Adam fail,
Should strive afresh against the foe,
Should strive and should prevail.",
"4": "And that a higher gift than grace
Should flesh and blood refine,
God's presence, and His very self
And essence all-divine.",
"5": "O generous love! that He, who smote
In man for man the foe,
The double agony in man
For man should undergo.",
"6": "And in the garden secretly,
And on the cross on high,
Should teach His brethren, and inspire
To suffer and to die.",
"7": "Praise to the Holiest in the height,
And in the depth be praise:
In all His words most wonderful;
Most sure in all His ways."}
