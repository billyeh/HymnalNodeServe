["1 Lord, speak to me, that I may speak\nIn living echoes of Thy tone;\nAs Thou hast sought, so let me seek\nThy erring children lost and lone.", "2 O lead me, Lord, that I may lead\nThe wandering and the wavering feet;\nO feed me, Lord, that I may feed\nThy hungering ones with manna sweet.", "3 O strengthen me, that while I stand\nFirm on the rock, and strong in Thee,\nI may stretch out a loving hand\nTo wrestlers with the troubled sea.", "4 O teach me, Lord, that I may teach\nThe precious things Thou dost impart;\nAnd wing my words, that they may reach\nThe hidden depths of many a heart.", "5 O give Thine own sweet rest to me,\nThat I may speak with soothing power\nA word in season, as from Thee\nTo weary ones in needful hour.", "6 O fill me with Thy fulness, Lord,\nUntil my very heart o'erflow\nIn kindling thought and glowing word,\nThy love to tell, Thy praise to show.", "7 O use me, Lord, use even me,\nJust as Thou wilt, and when, and where,\nUntil Thy blessed face I see,\nThy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share!"]
