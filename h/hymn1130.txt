["1 Sing praise to Christ Who lives in us,\nThe God of our salvation;\nWho saves us by His life divine,\nAnd not by regulation;\nAfter we've worked-done all we can,\nHis life has power to change a man:\nHis life divine can change us.", "2 He saves us to the uttermost\nBy His life-giving power;\nTransfusing Himself into us,\nHe saves us hour by hour.\nHe saved the lost by coming in,\nHe's saving now from more than sin:\nHe's saving us to glory!", "3 Our Lord was constituted priest\nTo be a real life-giver;\nLife is the nature of this One\nWho can from self deliver:\nHis life is indestructible,\nBy it He saves us to the full:\nPraise God, He's fully able!", "4 His life is fully qualified\nTo bring us through to glory;\nWere it not for His tested life,\n'Twould be another story\nHis life was fully tried on earth,\nTo crucifixion from His birth:\nHe passed through death and Hades.", "5 He's pledged to save us to the full,\nHis life is operating;\nHe's doing everything for us\n'Tis all for our perfecting;\nOur life's a failure at its best,\nOnly His life can stand the test:\nHis life brings full salvation!", "6 He's living now to intercede,\nContinuing forever;\nHe undertakes into the age,\nHis priesthood changes never;\nHe always lives to intercede,\nSuch a High Priest is what we need:\nHe's higher than the heavens.", "7 Come forward now to God through Him,\nNe'er shrink back to destruction;\nCome forward now to get the life,\nWhich brings the proper function;\nCome forward now the life to take,\nBy life His people us He'll make,\nAnd swallow death forever."]
