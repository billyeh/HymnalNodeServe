{"1": "Lord, day by day I view Thy wondrous Cross
On Calvary!
And day by day I stretch my hands thereon
And die with Thee.",
"2": "I "glory in the Cross" most loving Lord,
Because I know
It is the power to save and satisfy,
Where'er I go.",
"3": "The daily Cross becomes the deepest joy,
For just beyond
The Cross, I clearly see how Cross and Crown
Do correspond.",
"4": "Oh, gracious Lord, how sweet to take from Thee
The daily Cross!
And know that I can never separate
Its gain and loss.",
"5": "The daily Cross is daily loss to all
That keeps from Thee;
The daily Cross is daily gain of all
Thou art for me."}
