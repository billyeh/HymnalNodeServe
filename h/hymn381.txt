["1 Fill all my vision, Savior, I pray,\nLet me see only Jesus today;\nThough through the valley Thou leadest me,\nThy fadeless glory encompasseth me.", "chorus Fill all my vision, Savior divine,\nTill with Thy glory my spirit shall shine.\nFill all my vision, that all may see\nThy Holy Image reflected in me.", "2 Fill all my vision, every desire\nKeep for Thy glory; my soul inspire\nWith Thy perfection, Thy holy love,\nFlooding my pathway with light from above.", "3 Fill all my vision, let naught of sin\nShadow the brightness shining within.\nLet me see only Thy blessed face,\nFeasting my soul on Thy infinite grace."]
