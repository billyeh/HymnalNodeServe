And, O Lord, we seek Thy face.

This is for Thy kingdom, Lord;
To subdue the earth before us
We are all in one accord.",

In our spirit, on the church-ground-
This the way of victory.",

To fulfill Thy holy purpose
Saturate us thoroughly.",

Let us here our lessons learn,
Send us forth to many cities
For the church-life there to burn.",

Hallelujah for the saints,
Hallelujah for the meetings
And their holy, sweet constraints!",

Hallelujah we will sing;
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah to our King!"}
