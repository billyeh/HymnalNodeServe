["1 In a low dungeon, hope we had none;\nTried to believe, but faith didn't come;\nGod, our sky clearing, Jesus appearing,\nWe by God were transfused!\nWe by God were transfused!", "chorus Propitiation made by the blood,\nJesus' redemption bought us for God!\nNo condemnation, justification!\nWe have peace toward God!\nWe have peace toward God!", "2 Born into Adam, dying we were;\nWe had a sickness no one could cure.\nGod, His Son sending, old Adam ending;\nHe is dead, we are free!\nHe is dead, we are free!", "3 Now we're rejoicing, standing in grace,\nOh hallelujah! Sin is erased!\nGod, in us flowing, in our hearts growing,\nWe are saved in His life!\nWe are saved in His life!"]
