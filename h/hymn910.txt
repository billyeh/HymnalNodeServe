{"1": "The overflow of life is work
The work should be our living!
What we experience e'er should be,
The message we are giving.
When living and the work are one
The work will be effectual;
When message and the life are one
The word will be successful.",
"2": "The work must be the fruit of life
Born thru the Spirit's flowing;
As branches of the Lord, the vine
Fruit bearing, life bestowing.
'Tis Christ Himself thru us to work
Himself as life expressing
And all the riches of His life,
To others manifesting.",
"3": "'Tis not a movement borne of man
But by His power moving;
'Tis not the deeds done outwardly
But inward action proving.
'Tis not the work of enterprise
But 'tis His life confessing;
'Tis not to toil for our success
But 'tis Himself expressing.",
"4": "Our plans, our aims, our energy,
We must abandon wholly
That He may work His plan thru us
His aim and object solely.
Ourselves, with all we are and have
To death we must surrender
That Christ may live Himself thru us,
With riches and with splendor."}
