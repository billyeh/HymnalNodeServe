{"1": "I want that adorning divine,
Thou only, my Lord, canst bestow;
I want in those beautiful garments to shine,
Which mark out Thy beauty below.",
"2": "I want every moment to feel
Thy Spirit indwelling my heart,
His pow'r ever present to cleanse and to heal,
And newness of life to impart.",
"3": "I want, oh, I want to attain
Some likeness, my Savior, to Thee;
That longed-for resemblance once more to regain;
Thy comeliness put upon me.",
"4": "I want to be marked for Thine own,
Thy seal on my forehead to wear;
And have that new name on the mystic white stone,
Which none but Thyself can declare.",
"5": "I want, and this sums up my prayer,
To glorify Thee till I die;
Then calmly to yield up my soul to Thy care,
And breathe out in faith my last sigh!"}
