["1 I want that adorning divine,\nThou only, my Lord, canst bestow;\nI want in those beautiful garments to shine,\nWhich mark out Thy beauty below.", "2 I want every moment to feel\nThy Spirit indwelling my heart,\nHis pow'r ever present to cleanse and to heal,\nAnd newness of life to impart.", "3 I want, oh, I want to attain\nSome likeness, my Savior, to Thee;\nThat longed-for resemblance once more to regain;\nThy comeliness put upon me.", "4 I want to be marked for Thine own,\nThy seal on my forehead to wear;\nAnd have that new name on the mystic white stone,\nWhich none but Thyself can declare.", "5 I want, and this sums up my prayer,\nTo glorify Thee till I die;\nThen calmly to yield up my soul to Thy care,\nAnd breathe out in faith my last sigh!"]
