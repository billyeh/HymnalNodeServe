["1 To Jerusalem we've come,\nWe are through with Babylon,\nWe have gathered to be one,\nO glory be to God!\nOf the teachings we're bereft,\nAll opinions we have left,\nSpirit from the soul is cleft,\nIn the local churches now.", "chorus Hallelujah! Hallelujah!\nWe are all in one accord\nFor the building of the Lord.\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nWe are living in the local churches now!", "2 That recovery may proceed\nReal priests are what we need-\nThose who live in Christ indeed,\nO glory be to God!\nSaturated with the Lord,\nThey have Christ as their reward.\nThese the building work afford\nIn the local churches now.", "3 And the kingship we must see\nWith divine authority-\nTo this rule we'll all agree,\nO glory be to God!\nTo the Spirit we'll submit\nFor the church's benefit-\nThis is His prerequisite\nIn the local churches now.", "4 We the altar must obtain,\nHave our all upon it lain.\nThe burnt-offering must be slain,\nO glory be to God!\nThis we never should dispute,\nFor the church be absolute,\nAll that's otherwise uproot\nIn the local churches now.", "5 The foundation now is laid-\nO what glory doth pervade!\nWe are all with joy arrayed,\nO glory be to God!\nLet us raise a mighty shout-\nThey will hear us far without,\nAnd the enemy we'll rout\nIn the local churches now."]
