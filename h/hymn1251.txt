{"1": "To Jerusalem we've come,
We are through with Babylon,
We have gathered to be one,
O glory be to God!
Of the teachings we're bereft,
All opinions we have left,
Spirit from the soul is cleft,
In the local churches now.",
"chorus": "Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
We are all in one accord
For the building of the Lord.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
We are living in the local churches now!",
"2": "That recovery may proceed
Real priests are what we need-
Those who live in Christ indeed,
O glory be to God!
Saturated with the Lord,
They have Christ as their reward.
These the building work afford
In the local churches now.",
"3": "And the kingship we must see
With divine authority-
To this rule we'll all agree,
O glory be to God!
To the Spirit we'll submit
For the church's benefit-
This is His prerequisite
In the local churches now.",
"4": "We the altar must obtain,
Have our all upon it lain.
The burnt-offering must be slain,
O glory be to God!
This we never should dispute,
For the church be absolute,
All that's otherwise uproot
In the local churches now.",
"5": "The foundation now is laid-
O what glory doth pervade!
We are all with joy arrayed,
O glory be to God!
Let us raise a mighty shout-
They will hear us far without,
And the enemy we'll rout
In the local churches now."}
