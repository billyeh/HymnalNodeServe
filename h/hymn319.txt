["1 Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,\nTune my heart to sing Thy grace;\nStreams of mercy, never ceasing,\nCall for songs of loudest praise.\nJesus sought me when a stranger,\nWand'ring from the face of God;\nHe, to save my soul from danger,\nInterposed His precious blood.", "2 O to grace how great a debtor\nDaily I'm constrained to be!\nLet that grace, Lord, like a fetter,\nBind my wand'ring heart to Thee.\nTeach me, Lord, some rapturous measure,\nMeet for me Thy grace to prove,\nWhile I sing the countless treasure\nOf my God's unchanging love.", "3 Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;\nProne to leave the God I love:\nTake my heart, oh, take and seal it\nWith Thy Spirit from above.\nRescued thus from sin and danger,\nPurchased by the Savior's blood,\nMay I walk on earth a stranger,\nAs a son and heir of God."]
