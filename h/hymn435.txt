["1 Oh, the bitter shame and sorrow,\nThat a time could ever be,\nWhen I let the Savior's pity\nPlead in vain, and proudly answered,\nAll of self, and none of Thee,\nAll of self and none of Thee.", "2 Yet He found me; I beheld Him\nBleeding on the cursed tree;\nHeard Him pray, Forgive them, Father,\nAnd my wistful heart said faintly,\nSome of self, and some of Thee,\nSome of self, and some of Thee.", "3 Day by day His tender mercy,\nHealing, helping, full and free,\nSweet and strong, and ah! so patient,\nBrought me lower while I whispered,\nLess of self, and more of Thee,\nLess of self, and more of Thee.", "4 Higher than the highest heavens,\nDeeper than the deepest sea,\nLord, Thy love at last hath conquered;\nGrant me now my heart's petition,\nNone of self, and all of Thee,\nNone of self, and all of Thee."]
