["1 Abide in Thee! in that deep love of Thine,\nMy Jesus, Lord, Thou Lamb of God divine,\nDown, closely down, as living branch with tree,\nI would abide, my Lord, my Christ, in Thee.", "2 Abide in Thee! my Savior God, I know\nHow love of Thine so vast in me may flow,\nMy empty vessel, running o'er with joy,\nMust overflow to Thee without alloy.", "3 Abide in Thee! nor doubt, nor self, nor sin,\nCan e'er prevail with Thy blest life within;\nJoined to Thyself, communing deep, my soul\nKnows naught besides its motions to control.", "4 Abide in Thee! 'tis thus I only know\nThe secrets of Thy mind e'en while below-\nAll joy and peace, and knowledge of Thy word,\nAll pow'r and fruit, and service for the Lord."]
