{"1": "Death cannot hold the resurrection life
The life of God eternal manifest;
'Tis uncreated, indestructible
'Tis Christ Himself, unconqu'rable, expressed,",
"2": "Death cannot hold the resurrection life
Though all its force against it may combine;
Death only gives it opportunity,
To show the boundless pow'r of life divine.",

The more interred, the more it multiplies;
All kinds of suff'ring only help it grow,
And fruits of life abundant realize.",
"4": "Death cannot hold the resurrection life
Thru every block and barrier it breaks;
Conqu'ring the pow'r of darkness and of hell
It swallows death and victory partakes.",
"5": "Death cannot hold the resurrection life
All of God's fulness it will manifest;
God's righteousness and holiness it yields
His glorious image by it is expressed.",
"6": "Oh, may I know this resurrection life
In every kind of death its pow'r outpoured
In my experience ever realize,
This life is nought but Christ my living Lord."}
