["1 I love Thy kingdom, Lord,\nThe house of Thine abode,\nThe Church our blest Redeemer bought\nWith His own precious blood.", "2 I love the Church, O God!\nHer walls before Thee stand,\nDear as the apple of Thine eye\nAnd graven on Thy hand.", "3 For her my tears shall fall,\nFor her my prayers ascend;\nTo her my cares and toils be given\nTill toils and cares shall end.", "4 Beyond my highest joy\nI prize her heavenly ways,\nHer sweet communion, solemn vows,\nHer hymns of love and praise.", "5 Sure as Thy truth shall last,\nTo Zion shall be given\nThe brightest glories earth can yield,\nAnd brighter bliss of heaven."]
