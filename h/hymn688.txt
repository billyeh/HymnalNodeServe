["1 I've seen the lightning flashing,\nAnd heard the thunder roll;\nI've felt sin's breakers dashing,\nTrying to conquer my soul;\nI've heard the voice of Jesus,\nTelling me still to fight on;\nHe promised never to leave me,\nNever to leave me alone.", "chorus No, never alone,\nNo, never alone,\nHe promised never to leave me,\nNever to leave me alone;\nNo, never alone,\nNo, never alone,\nHe promised never to leave me,\nNever to leave me alone.", "2 The world's fierce winds are blowing,\nTemptations are sharp and keen;\nI feel a peace in knowing\nMy Savior stands between;\nHe stands to shield me from danger,\nWhen earthly friends are gone,\nHe promised never to leave me,\nNever to leave me alone.", "3 When in affliction's valley,\nI'm treading the road of care,\nMy Savior helps me to carry\nMy cross when heavy to bear;\nMy feet entangled with briars,\nReady to cast mt down;\nMy Savior whispered His promise,\nNever to leave me alone.", "4 He died for me on the mountain,\nFor me they pierced His side,\nFor me He opened that fountain,\nThe crimson, cleansing tide;\nFor me He waiteth in gory,\nSeated upon His throne;\nHe promised never to leave me,\nNever to leave me alone."]
