{"1": "I've seen the lightning flashing,
And heard the thunder roll;
I've felt sin's breakers dashing,
Trying to conquer my soul;
I've heard the voice of Jesus,
Telling me still to fight on;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.",
"chorus": "No, never alone,
No, never alone,
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone;
No, never alone,
No, never alone,
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.",
"2": "The world's fierce winds are blowing,
Temptations are sharp and keen;
I feel a peace in knowing
My Savior stands between;
He stands to shield me from danger,
When earthly friends are gone,
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.",
"3": "When in affliction's valley,
I'm treading the road of care,
My Savior helps me to carry
My cross when heavy to bear;
My feet entangled with briars,
Ready to cast mt down;
My Savior whispered His promise,
Never to leave me alone.",
"4": "He died for me on the mountain,
For me they pierced His side,
For me He opened that fountain,
The crimson, cleansing tide;
For me He waiteth in gory,
Seated upon His throne;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone."}
