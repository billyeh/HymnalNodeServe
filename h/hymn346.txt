{"1": "I am not skilled to understand
What God hath willed, what God hath planned;
I only know at His right hand
Stands One who is my Savior.",
"2": "I take Him at His word indeed:
"Christ died for sinners"-this I read;
For in my heart I find a need
Of Him to be my Savior!",
"3": "That He should leave His place on high
And come for sinful man to die,
You count it strange? So once did I
Before I knew my Savior!",
"4": "And, oh, that He fulfilled may see
The travail of His soul in me,
And with His work contented be,
As I with my dear Savior!",
"5": "Yes, living, dying, let me bring
My strength, my solace from this spring-
That He who lives to be my King
Once died to be my Savior!"}
