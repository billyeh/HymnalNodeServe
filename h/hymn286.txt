{"1": "Of Jesus' love that sought me,
When I was lost in sin;
Of wondrous grace that brought me
Back to His fold again;
Of heights and depths of mercy,
Far deeper than the sea,
And higher than the heavens,
My theme shall ever be.",
"chorus": "Sweeter as the years go by,
Sweeter as the years go by;
Richer, fuller, deeper,
Jesus' love is sweeter,
Sweeter as the years go by.",
"2": "He trod in old Judea
Life's pathway long ago;
The people thronged about Him,
His saving grace to know.
He healed the broken-hearted,
And caused the blind to see;
And still His great heart yearneth
In love for even me."}
