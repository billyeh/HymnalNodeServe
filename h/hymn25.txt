{"1": "Father, to us Thy mercy Thou hast shown
In Thine own way;
Sinners like us as dear sons Thou wouldst own
In love for aye.
Vessels of mercy, Thou didst us prepare;
Vessels of honor, we Thyself declare.",
"2": ""In mercy I delight, not sacrifice,
Thou hast declared;
Thru this Thy mercy, favor in Thine eyes,
We all have shared.
'Tis not of them that will nor them that run
But of Thee showing mercy as was done.",
"3": "Father, Thy mercy with Thy love and grace,
Did we obtain;
And in Thy mercy, with Thee face to face
We'll e'er remain;
And for Thy mercy we would worship Thee,
Through all our days and through eternity."}
