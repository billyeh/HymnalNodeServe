{"1": "Requirements of the Kingdom are,
Much stricter than the law's decrees;
No other requisite of God,
Has ever higher been than these.",
"2": ""Repent, the Kingdom has come near,
This is the Kingdom's first demand;
A change of mind we all must have,
And on God's side must firmly stand.",
"3": "That we the Kingdom enter in
Surpassing righteousness we need
Exceeding that which is of law;
From life alone it must proceed.",
"4": "That we the Kingdom enter in
We need to do the Father's will
Not by our choice to work or act,
But His one purpose to fulfill.",
"5": "That we the Kingdom enter in
A simple child we must become-
Adjustable, obedient, meek-
And everything of self o'ercome.",
"6": "The Heav'nly Kingdom e'en requires,
That we as God should perfect be;
This standard we must fully meet,
That we may share its ecstasy.",
"7": "The Kingdom is the reign of God;
To match His nature is required;
'Tis only by the life of God,
The Kingdom's entry is acquired.",
"8": "The Kingdom is the rule of heav'n;
With heaven's state we must accord;
'Tis only by the life of heav'n,
That we may share it with the Lord."}
