["1 There is always something over,\nWhen we taste our gracious Lord;\nEvery cup He fills o'erfloweth,\nRich supply He doth afford.\nNothing narrow, nothing stinted,\nEver issued from His store;\nTo His own He gives full measure,\nRunning over, evermore,\nTo His own He gives full measure,\nRunning over, evermore.", "2 There is always something over,\nWhen we, from the Father's hand,\nTake our portion with thanksgiving,\nPraising for the things He planned.\nSatisfaction, full and deepening,\nAll our need He doth supply,\nWhen the heart has tasted Jesus\nIts desires to satisfy,\nWhen the heart has tasted Jesus\nIts desires to satisfy.", "3 There is always something over,\nWhen we share in all His love;\nUnplumbed depths still lie beneath us,\nUnscaled heights rise far above.\nHuman lips can never utter\nAll His wondrous tenderness.\nWe can only praise and wonder\nAnd His Name forever bless,\nWe can only praise and wonder\nAnd His Name forever bless."]
