["1 My God, my Portion, and my Love,\nMy everlasting All,\nI've none but Thee in heav'n above,\nOr on this earthly ball,\nOr on this earthly ball.", "2 What empty things are all the skies,\nAnd this inferior clod!\nThere's nothing here deserves my joys,\nThere's nothing like my God,\nThere's nothing like my God.", "3 To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends,\nAnd health, and safe abode;\nThanks to Thy name for meaner things,\nBut they are not my God,\nBut they are not my God.", "4 How vain a toy is glittering wealth,\nIf once compared to Thee!\nOr what's my safety, or my health,\nOr all my friends to me,\nOr all my friends to me.", "5 Were I possessor of the earth,\nAnd called the stars my own,\nWithout Thy graces and Thyself,\nI were a wretch undone,\nI were a wretch undone.", "6 Let others stretch their arms like seas,\nAnd grasp in all the shore;\nGrant me the visits of Thy grace,\nAnd I desire no more,\nAnd I desire no more."]
