["1 Eternal Light! Eternal Light!\nHow pure the soul must be\nWhen, placed within Thy searching sight,\nIt shrinks not, but with calm delight\nCan live and look on Thee.", "2 The spirits that surround Thy throne\nMay bear the burning bliss;\nBut that is surely theirs alone,\nSince they have never, never known\nA fallen world like this.", "3 Oh, how shall I, whose native sphere\nIs dark, whose mind is dim,\nBefore th' Ineffable appear,\nAnd on my natural spirit bear\nThe uncreated beam?", "4 There is a way for man to rise\nTo Thee, sublime Abode;\nAn Offering and a Sacrifice,\nA Holy Spirit's energies,\nAn Advocate with God:", "5 These, these prepare us for the sight\nOf holiness above;\nThe sons of ignorance and night\nMay dwell in the eternal Light,\nThrough the eternal Love."]
