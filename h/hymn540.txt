{"1": "What release the Savior gave me!
Christ indeed has set me free!
All the pow'r of sin is broken
All death's sting is passed from me!",
"chorus": "Christ has made me more than conqu'ror
By His mighty victory
Now His resurrection power,
From my spirit strengthens me!",
"2": "From the law Christ has delivered
To its claims I'm ever dead;
Nevermore the law shall bind me
But by grace I'll live instead.",
"3": "Christ has sin condemned at Calv'ry,
And its power done away;
Now it has no ground within me
I am freed from all its sway.",
"4": "Death by Him has been abolished
Incorrupted life is shown;
Death's enthralling bonds are broken
Resurrection life is known.",
"5": "Christ through death has crushed the devil
World and demons by His might
From the pow'r of darkness brought me,
To the realm of life and light.",
"6": "All-sufficient grace He giveth
With His pow'r He covers me
Makes me glory in my weakness,
And in weakness strengthens me."}
