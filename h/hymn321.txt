["1 Full salvation! Full salvation!\nLo, the fountain opened wide,\nStreams through every land and nation\nFrom the Savior's wounded side.\nFull salvation! Full salvation!\nStreams an endless crimson tide.", "2 Oh, the glorious revelation!\nSee the cleansing current flow,\nWashing stains of condemnation\nWhiter than the driven snow:\nFull salvation! Full salvation!\nOh, the rapturous bliss to know.", "3 Love's resistless current sweeping\nAll the regions deep within;\nThought, and wish, and senses keeping\nNow, and every instant, clean:\nFull salvation! Full salvation!\nFrom the guilt and power of sin.", "4 Life immortal, Christ descending,\nLo! my heart the Spirit's shrine:\nGod and man in oneness blending,\nOh, what fellowship is mine!\nFull salvation! Full salvation!\nRaised in Christ to life divine!", "5 Care and doubting, gloom and sorrow,\nFear and shame are mine no more;\nFaith knows naught of dark tomorrow,\nFor my Savior goes before:\nFull salvation! Full salvation!\nFull and free for evermore!"]
