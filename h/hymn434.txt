["1 Lord, Thou hast won, at length I yield;\nMy heart by mighty grace compelled\nSurrenders all to Thee;\nAgainst Thy terrors long I strove,\nBut who can stand against Thy love?\nLove conquers even me.", "2 If Thou hadst bid Thy thunders roll,\nAnd light'nings flash, to blast my soul,\nI still had stubborn been;\nBut mercy has my heart subdued,\nA bleeding Savior I have viewed,\nAnd now I hate my sin.", "3 Now, Lord, I would be Thine alone,\nCome, take possession of Thine own,\nFor Thou hast set me free;\nReleased from Satan's hard command,\nSee all my powers waiting stand,\nTo be employed by Thee."]
