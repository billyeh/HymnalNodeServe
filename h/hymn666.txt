["1 Watch, for the night is ending!\nWatch, and the world not seek;\nWatch, for the day is dawning!\nWatch, sink not in sleep.\nWatch, for the Lord is coming!\nWatch for the foe's attack:\nWatch, for the Lord is waiting!\nWatch, be never slack.", "2 Watch, and arise in service!\nWatch, though the day be drear;\nWatch, and go forth to labor!\nWatch, the end is near.\nWatch and put on thy armor!\nWatch with thy spirit strong;\nWatch to resist the devil!\nWatch, Christ comes ere long.", "3 Watch for the Savior's coming!\nWatch for the Morning Star;\nWatch and pursue the Kingdom!\nWatch with many a scar.\nWatch, and be ever watchful!\nWatch, till the night is done;\nWatch till the dawn of glory!\nWatch till the Lord shall come."]
