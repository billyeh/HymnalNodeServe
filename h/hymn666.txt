{"1": "Watch, for the night is ending!
Watch, and the world not seek;
Watch, for the day is dawning!
Watch, sink not in sleep.
Watch, for the Lord is coming!
Watch for the foe's attack:
Watch, for the Lord is waiting!
Watch, be never slack.",
"2": "Watch, and arise in service!
Watch, though the day be drear;
Watch, and go forth to labor!
Watch, the end is near.
Watch and put on thy armor!
Watch with thy spirit strong;
Watch to resist the devil!
Watch, Christ comes ere long.",
"3": "Watch for the Savior's coming!
Watch for the Morning Star;
Watch and pursue the Kingdom!
Watch with many a scar.
Watch, and be ever watchful!
Watch, till the night is done;
Watch till the dawn of glory!
Watch till the Lord shall come."}
