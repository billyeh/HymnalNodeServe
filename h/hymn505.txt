{"1": "There's a Man in the glory
Whose Life is for me.
He's pure and He's holy,
Triumphant and free.
He's wise and He's loving
How tender is He!
His Life in the glory,
My life must be;
His Life in the glory,
My life must be.",
"2": "There's a Man in the glory
Whose Life is for me.
He overcame Satan;
From bondage He's free.
In Life He is reigning;
How kingly is He!
His Life in the glory,
My life must be;
His Life in the glory,
My life must be.",
"3": "There's a Man in the glory
Whose Life is for me.
In Him is no sickness;
No weakness has He.
He's strong and in vigor,
How buoyant is He!
His Life in the glory
My life may be;
His Life in the glory
My life may be.",
"4": "There's a Man in the glory
Whose Life is for me.
His peace is abiding;
How patient is He!
He's joyful and radiant,
Expecting to see
His Life in the glory
Lived out in me;
His Life in the glory
Lived out in me."}
