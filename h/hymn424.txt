{"1": "Lord, I believe a rest remains
To all Thy people known;
A rest where pure enjoyment reigns,
And Thou art loved alone.",
"2": "A rest, where all our soul's desire
Is fixed on things above;
Where fear and sin and grief expire,
Cast out by perfect love.",
"3": "Oh, that I now the rest might know,
Believe, and enter in;
Now, Savior, now the power bestow,
And let me cease from sin.",
"4": "Remove this hardness from my heart,
This unbelief remove;
To me the rest of faith impart,
The Sabbath of Thy love.",
"5": "I would be Thine, Thou know'st I would,
And have Thee all my own;
Thee, O my all-sufficient Good,
I want, and Thee alone."}
