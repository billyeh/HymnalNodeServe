["1 Lord, I believe a rest remains\nTo all Thy people known;\nA rest where pure enjoyment reigns,\nAnd Thou art loved alone.", "2 A rest, where all our soul's desire\nIs fixed on things above;\nWhere fear and sin and grief expire,\nCast out by perfect love.", "3 Oh, that I now the rest might know,\nBelieve, and enter in;\nNow, Savior, now the power bestow,\nAnd let me cease from sin.", "4 Remove this hardness from my heart,\nThis unbelief remove;\nTo me the rest of faith impart,\nThe Sabbath of Thy love.", "5 I would be Thine, Thou know'st I would,\nAnd have Thee all my own;\nThee, O my all-sufficient Good,\nI want, and Thee alone."]
