["1 Let's take the land! The land that God has given us;\nIn all our living, Christ can be so much:\nTo take this land, we have th' equipment that we need-\nThe blood, the Word, the Spirit, and the church.", "chorus Sisters:\nLet's take the land! O Christian brothers,\nThe land that God has given us.\nBe strong and take it, for we can make it\nAnd gain this land so glorious!\nBrothers:\nLet's take the land! O Christian sisters,\nAnd to these things give earnest heed.\nThe Lord implores us; He's gone before us\nAnd given everything we need!", "2 We have the blood! Christ is our spotless offering,\nWho gave Himself, our God to satisfy;\nAnd so we come with boldness to the throne of grace,\nAnd all day long, the precious blood apply.", "3 We have the Word! The written Word's our daily food;\nWe mix this Word with faith and say \"Amen!\"\nThen thro' the day, the spoken Word will speak to us\nAnd regulate our living from within.", "4 The Spirit's ours! The Spirit of reality,\nHe's independent of the way we feel;\nHe dwells in us, and teaches us to dwell in Him,\nAnd guides us into everything that's real.", "5 We have the church! All saints are needed to possess\nThe fullness of this vast reality;\nTogether we will gain this all-inclusive Christ,\nAnd He to us our everything will be."]
