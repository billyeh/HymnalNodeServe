{"1": "Let's take the land! The land that God has given us;
In all our living, Christ can be so much:
To take this land, we have th' equipment that we need-
The blood, the Word, the Spirit, and the church.",
"chorus": "Sisters:
Let's take the land! O Christian brothers,
The land that God has given us.
Be strong and take it, for we can make it
And gain this land so glorious!
Brothers:
Let's take the land! O Christian sisters,
And to these things give earnest heed.
The Lord implores us; He's gone before us
And given everything we need!",
"2": "We have the blood! Christ is our spotless offering,
Who gave Himself, our God to satisfy;
And so we come with boldness to the throne of grace,
And all day long, the precious blood apply.",
"3": "We have the Word! The written Word's our daily food;
We mix this Word with faith and say "Amen!"
Then thro' the day, the spoken Word will speak to us
And regulate our living from within.",
"4": "The Spirit's ours! The Spirit of reality,
He's independent of the way we feel;
He dwells in us, and teaches us to dwell in Him,
And guides us into everything that's real.",
"5": "We have the church! All saints are needed to possess
The fullness of this vast reality;
Together we will gain this all-inclusive Christ,
And He to us our everything will be."}
