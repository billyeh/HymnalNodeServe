["1 The Great Physician now is near,\nThe sympathizing Jesus;\nHe speaks the drooping heart to cheer,\nOh, hear the voice of Jesus!", "chorus Sweetest note in seraph song;\nSweetest name on mortal tongue;\nSweetest carol ever sung:\nJesus, blessed Jesus!", "2 Your many sins are all forgiv'n,\nOh, hear the voice of Jesus;\nThe veil 'twixt you and God is riven,\nRedemption wrought by Jesus.", "3 All glory to the dying Lamb!\nI now believe in Jesus;\nI love the blessed Savior's name,\nI love the name of Jesus.", "4 His name dispels my guilt and fear,\nNo other name but Jesus;\nOh, how my soul delights to hear\nThe precious name of Jesus!"]
