{"1": "There's a stormy wind a-blowing from the north;
Let it blow! Let it blow!
God as our experience will the wind bring forth;
Let it blow! Let it blow!",
"chorus": "Let it blow! the rushing mighty wind;
Let it blow us into life!
Let it blow! the gracious wind of God;
Let it blow us into Christ!",
"2": "There's a hov'ring cloud a-following the wind,
Covering us! Covering us!
And the presence of the Lord the cloud does bring,
Covering us! Covering us!",
"chorus": "Covering us, God's overshadowing cloud-
God has come to stay with us.
Covering us, the gracious cloud of God-
Strength and comfort glorious!",
"3": "With the cloud continually a fire does flash
Burning us! Burning us!
It exposes sin, the soul life, and the flesh,
Burning us! Burning us!",
"chorus": "Let it burn! the jealous flame of God;
Let it burn continually!
Let it burn! this all-consuming flame;
Let it burn us thoroughly!",
"4": "Then from out the fire does the electrum glow,
Shining forth! Shining forth!
The redeeming God does our experience show,
Shining forth! Shining forth!",
"chorus": "Let Him shine! This gold and silver One;
Let Him shine for all to see!
'Tis the Lamb-God who has now become
Our enjoyment inwardly.",
"5": "Let the wind, cloud, fire and th' electrum be
Wrought in us, o'er and o'er;
Let this cycle be repeated constantly
More and more, more and more!",
"chorus": "Blow and hover, burn and shine forth, Lord,
All our being to possess,
That we all may gain Thee constantly
All Thy likeness to express."}
