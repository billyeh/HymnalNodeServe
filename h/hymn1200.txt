["1 There's a stormy wind a-blowing from the north;\nLet it blow! Let it blow!\nGod as our experience will the wind bring forth;\nLet it blow! Let it blow!", "chorus Let it blow! the rushing mighty wind;\nLet it blow us into life!\nLet it blow! the gracious wind of God;\nLet it blow us into Christ!", "2 There's a hov'ring cloud a-following the wind,\nCovering us! Covering us!\nAnd the presence of the Lord the cloud does bring,\nCovering us! Covering us!", "chorus Covering us, God's overshadowing cloud-\nGod has come to stay with us.\nCovering us, the gracious cloud of God-\nStrength and comfort glorious!", "3 With the cloud continually a fire does flash\nBurning us! Burning us!\nIt exposes sin, the soul life, and the flesh,\nBurning us! Burning us!", "chorus Let it burn! the jealous flame of God;\nLet it burn continually!\nLet it burn! this all-consuming flame;\nLet it burn us thoroughly!", "4 Then from out the fire does the electrum glow,\nShining forth! Shining forth!\nThe redeeming God does our experience show,\nShining forth! Shining forth!", "chorus Let Him shine! This gold and silver One;\nLet Him shine for all to see!\n'Tis the Lamb-God who has now become\nOur enjoyment inwardly.", "5 Let the wind, cloud, fire and th' electrum be\nWrought in us, o'er and o'er;\nLet this cycle be repeated constantly\nMore and more, more and more!", "chorus Blow and hover, burn and shine forth, Lord,\nAll our being to possess,\nThat we all may gain Thee constantly\nAll Thy likeness to express."]
