["1 Thou Breath from still eternity\nBreathe o'er my spirit's barren land-\nThe pine tree and the myrtle tree\nShall spring amid the desert sand;\nAnd where Thy living water flows\nThe waste shall blossom as the rose.", "2 May I in will and deed and word\nObey Thee as a little child;\nAnd keep me in Thy love, my Lord,\nFor ever holy, undefiled;\nWithin me teach, and strive, and pray,\nLest I should choose my own wild way.", "3 Thy Spirit, Stream by Thee, the Son,\nIs opened to us crystal pure,\nForth flowing from the heavenly throne\nTo waiting hearts and spirits poor;\nAthirst and weary do I sink\nBeside Thy waters, there to drink.", "4 My spirit turns to Thee and clings,\nAll else forsaking, unto Thee;\nForgetting all created things,\nRemembering only \"God in me.\"\nThy living Stream, Thy gracious Rain,\nNone wait for these, and wait in vain."]
