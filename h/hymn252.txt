{"1": "Thou Breath from still eternity
Breathe o'er my spirit's barren land-
The pine tree and the myrtle tree
Shall spring amid the desert sand;
And where Thy living water flows
The waste shall blossom as the rose.",
"2": "May I in will and deed and word
Obey Thee as a little child;
And keep me in Thy love, my Lord,
For ever holy, undefiled;
Within me teach, and strive, and pray,
Lest I should choose my own wild way.",
"3": "Thy Spirit, Stream by Thee, the Son,
Is opened to us crystal pure,
Forth flowing from the heavenly throne
To waiting hearts and spirits poor;
Athirst and weary do I sink
Beside Thy waters, there to drink.",
"4": "My spirit turns to Thee and clings,
All else forsaking, unto Thee;
Forgetting all created things,
Remembering only "God in me."
Thy living Stream, Thy gracious Rain,
None wait for these, and wait in vain."}
