["1 Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;\nHere faith can touch and handle things unseen;\nHere would I grasp with firmer hand Thy grace,\nAnd all my weariness upon Thee lean.", "2 Here would I feed upon the Bread of God;\nHere drink with Thee the royal wine of heav'n;\nHere would I lay aside each earthly load;\nHere taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv'n.", "3 I have no help but Thine; nor do I need\nAnother arm save Thine to lean upon;\nIt is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;\nMy strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.", "4 This is the hour of banquet and of song;\nThis is the heav'nly table spread for me;\nHere let me feast, and, feasting, still prolong\nThe brief bright hour of fellowship with Thee.", "5 Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;\nThe feast, though not the love, is past and gone;\nThe bread and wine remove, but Thou art here,\nNearer than ever still our Shield and Sun.", "6 Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,\nYet passing, points to the glad feast above,\nGiving sweet foretastes of the festal joy,\nThe Lamb's great bridal-feast of bliss and love."]
