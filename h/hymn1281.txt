{"1": "All the meetings Christ appointed
And attended here on earth
Were apart from all religion,
All its rituals, forms, and dearth.
Resurrection, not religion,
Must be our reality;
Let us meet in resurrection,
From all dead religion free.",
"2": "When the Lord was resurrected,
All religious things were through;
Christ is now our living temple,
Christ is all our offerings too.
With our Lord in resurrection,
Hallelujah, we're released!
Pity all the old religion-
All our meetings are a feast!",
"3": "Yet religion-oh, how subtle-
In our blood is hiding out;
God must give us revelation,
All that unseen monster rout.
Lord, we still are too religious-
Down with our religious soul!
We would all release our spirit,
Let each meeting reach the goal.",
"4": "In the meetings, in the meetings,
On the mountain, at the shore,
Jesus, Jesus, living Jesus,
He is here-what want we more?
Bury all the old religion,
Even Christianity-
Jesus, Jesus, we have Jesus,
He is our reality!"}
