["1 Lord, Thy love has sought and found us\nWand'ring in this desert wide;\nThou hast thrown Thine arms around us,\nFor us suffered, bled, and died.\nSing, my soul! He loved thee,\nJesus gave Himself for me.", "2 Hark! what sounds of bitter weeping\nFrom yon lonesome garden sweep;\n'Tis the Lord His vigil keeping,\nWhile His followers sink in sleep.\nAh, my soul, He loved thee,\nYes, He gave Himself for me.", "3 He is speaking to His Father,\nTasting deep that bitter cup,\nYet He takes it, willing rather\nFor our sakes to drink it up.\nOh, what love! He loved me!\nGave Himself, my soul, for thee.", "4 Then that closing scene of anguish:\nAll God's waves and billows roll\nOver Him, there left to languish\nOn the cross, to save my soul.\nMatchless love! how vast, how free,\nJesus gave Himself for me.", "5 Hark again! His cries are waking\nEchoes on dark Calvary's hill;\nGod, my God, art Thou forsaking\nHim who always did Thy will?\nAh, my soul! it was for thee,\nYes! He gave Himself for me.", "6 Lord, we joy, Thy toils are ended,\nGlad Thy suff'ring time is o'er;\nTo Thy Father's throne ascended,\nThere Thou liv'st, to die no more.\nYes, my soul, He lives for thee,\nHe who gave Himself for me.", "7 Lord, we worship and adore Thee\nFor Thy rich, Thy matchless grace;\nPerfect soon in joy before Thee,\nWe shall see Thee face to face.\nYet e'en now our song shall be,\nJesus gave Himself for me."]
