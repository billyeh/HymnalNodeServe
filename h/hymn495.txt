{"1": "Christ is God's centrality,
And His universality;
He is God's delight and joy,
Throughout all eternity.",
"2": "He's th' embodiment of God
In Him all God's fulness dwells;
His unique supremacy,
And His Godhead none excels.",
"3": "All God's purpose is for Him
That He might be all in all;
All the things in heav'n and earth,
With Himself are made withal.",
"4": "All creation is for Christ
Everything was made by Him;
'Tis by Him all things subsist
He's the hub and He's the rim.",
"5": "In redemption He is all
All through Him is reconciled;
By His blood all things with God,
Now in peace are domiciled.",
"6": "He the great beginning is
And the Church's living Head;
He her life and content too
And the firstborn from the dead.",
"7": "In God's Kingdom He's the King
All the pow'r to Him is giv'n;
In His glory He shall rule,
Over all in earth and heav'n,",
"8": "In new heaven and new earth,
Center of all things He'll be
For the Godhead and for man,
Throughout all eternity.",
"9": "God intends in everything,
Christ should have preeminence
And that such a Christ of all,
We should now experience."}
