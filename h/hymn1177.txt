["1 Oh, Christ in all His glory put on humanity\nSo He could be my Person, and live instead of me.\nA man in life and being, He fully fits my case,\nSo all His glorious Person can me replace.\nO Lord, O Lord, You are the man for me!\nI take You as my Person, as my full identity.\nO Lord, O Lord, subdue my every part,\nAnd every moment, every place, make home in all my heart.", "2 Oh, Christ became the Spirit to speak inside of me,\nAnd as the speaking Spirit He speaks unceasingly.\nHis speaking is the water that washes me within,\nDischarging all my oldness, imparting Him.\nO Lord, O Lord, speak all You want to me.\nYour speaking is Your presence-I must have it constantly.\nO Lord, O Lord, speak-wash my every part\nAnd by this metabolic change, make home in all my heart.", "3 Oh, Christ will come, the Bridegroom, for us, His glorious Bride,\nBy coming from within us the church is glorified.\nHis Person is the glory expanding now in us;\nThis glory is our Person-how glorious!\nO Lord, O Lord, by Your economy\nSo flood us with Your glory, saturate us thoroughly.\nCome out, come out, break forth in glory here,\nAnd from the church, O glorious One, in glory soon appear."]
