{"1": "Of Him whence grace and truth did spring,
We're at the fountain drinking;
This Christ we'll ever praise and sing,
Here in the church, His home!",
"chorus": "Glory to God! We're at the fountain drinking!
Glory to God! We're in the church, our home!",
"2": "Ask but His grace, and lo, 'tis giv'n,
We're at the fountain drinking;
Seek but Himself, the heaven of heaven,
And find Him here at home!",
"3": "Though Satan fights with all his power,
We're at the fountain drinking;
He'll not prevail, not one short hour,
Against the church, our home!",
"4": "Athirst we to this spring do fly,
We're at the fountain drinking;
Drink deep, this well will not run dry!
It's in the church, our home!"}
