["1 Master, speak! Thy servant heareth,\nWaiting for Thy gracious word,\nLonging for Thy voice that cheereth\nMaster, let it now be heard.\nI am list'ning, Lord, for Thee;\nWhat hast Thou to say to me?", "2 Often through my heart is pealing\nMany another voice than Thine,\nMany an unwilled echo stealing\nFrom the walls of this Thy shrine.\nLet Thy longed-for accents fall;\nMaster, speak! and silence all.", "3 Master, speak! though least and lowest,\nLet me not unheard depart;\nMaster, speak! for oh, Thou knowest\nAll the yearning of my heart.\nKnowest all its truest need;\nSpeak! and make me blest indeed.", "4 Master, speak! and make me ready,\nWhen Thy voice is truly heard,\nWith obedience glad and steady,\nStill to follow every word\nI am listening, Lord, for Thee:\nMaster, speak, oh, speak to me!", "5 Speak to me by name, O Master,\nLet me know it is to me;\nSpeak, that I may follow faster,\nWith a step more firm and free,\nWhere the Shepherd leads the flock\nIn the shadow of the Rock!"]
