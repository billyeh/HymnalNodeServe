{"1": "Weary pilgrim on life's pathway-
Struggling on beneath thy load-
Hear these words of consolation,
"Cast thy burden on the Lord."",
"chorus": "Cast thy burden on the Lord!
Cast thy burden on the Lord,
And He will strengthen thee,
sustain and comfort thee-
Cast thy burden on the Lord.",
"2": "Are thy tired feet unsteady?
Does thy lamp no light afford?
Is thy cross too great and heavy?
"Cast thy burden on the Lord."",
"3": "Are the ties of friendship severed?
Hushed the voices fondly heard?
Breaks thy heart with weight of anguish?
"Cast thy burden on the Lord."",
"4": "Does thy heart with faintness falter?
Does thy mind forget His word?
Does thy strength succumb to weakness?
"Cast thy burden on the Lord."",
"5": "He will hold thee up from falling;
He will guide thy steps aright;
He will strengthen each endeavor;
He will keep thee by His might."}
