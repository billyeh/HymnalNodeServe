{"1": "Let us eat Jesus every day,
Eating His flesh in such a way
That in the trials great or small
He as a Man will be our all.",
"chorus": "Eat, eat more of Jesus!
Eat, eat more of Jesus!
Why should we undernourished be
When we have His humanity?",
"2": "Let us drink Jesus till we see
That we are human, Jesusly!
Till rivers flood the barren ground
And quench the thirst of all around.",
"chorus": "Drink, drink more of Jesus!
Drink, drink more of Jesus!
Why should we ever thirsty be
When we have His humanity?",
"3": "We must eat Jesus till God can
Have the fulfillment of His plan-
One man expressed for all to see,
One church in each locality.",
"chorus": "We'll masticate Jesus!
We'll masticate Jesus!
Then to the tent of meeting bring
Jesus, our real meal offering."}
