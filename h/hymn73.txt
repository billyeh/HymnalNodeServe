Mighty Savior!\nIn Thy Name is all I need;\nJust to breathe the Name of Jesus,\nIs to drink of Life indeed.", "3 Glorious, mighty Name of Jesus,\nHeav'n and earth its pow'r proclaim;\nBut forgiven sinners only,\nKnow the balm of Jesus' Name.", "4 Jesus! Jesus! Name most precious,\nBalm in pain or mighty sword;\nIn Thy Name, we live and conquer,\nBlessed, glorious, coming Lord."]
