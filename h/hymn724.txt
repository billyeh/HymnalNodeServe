["1 A little bird I am,\nShut from the fields of air,\nAnd in my cage I sit and sing\nTo Him who placed me there;\nWell pleased a prisoner to be,\nBecause, my God, it pleaseth Thee.", "2 Nought have I else to do,\nI sing the whole day long;\nAnd He whom most I love to please\nDoth listen to my song;\nHe caught and bound my wandering wing;\nBut still He bends to hear me sing.", "3 Thou hast an ear to hear\nA heart to love and bless;\nAnd though my notes were e'er so rude,\nThou wouldst not hear the less;\nBecause Thou knowest as they fall,\nThat love, sweet love, inspires them all.", "4 My cage confines me round;\nAbroad I cannot fly;\nBut though my wing is closely bound,\nMy heart's at liberty;\nFor prison walls cannot control\nThe flight, the freedom of the soul.", "5 O it is good to soar\nThese bolts and bars above!\nTo Him whose purpose I adore,\nWhose providence I love;\nAnd in Thy mighty will to find\nThe joy, the freedom of the mind."]
