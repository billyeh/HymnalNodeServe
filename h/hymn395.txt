["1 O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me,\nAnd all things else recede;\nMy heart be daily nearer Thee,\nFrom sin be daily freed.", "chorus Each day let Thy supporting might\nMy weakness still embrace;\nMy darkness vanish in Thy light,\nThy life my death efface.", "2 In Thy bright beams which on me fall,\nFade every evil thought;\nThat I am nothing, Thou art all,\nI would be daily taught.", "3 More of Thy glory let me see,\nThou Holy, Wise, and True;\nI would Thy living image be,\nIn joy and sorrow too.", "4 Fill me with gladness from above,\nHold me by strength divine;\nLord, let the glow of Thy great love\nThrough all my being shine.", "5 Make this poor self grow less and less,\nBe Thou my life and aim;\nOh, make me daily through Thy grace\nMore meet to bear Thy name."]
