["1 His countenance angels can often behold,\nBut ne'er taste His love in His grace;\nHis saints, though they know of His pure, boundless love,\nHave never yet once seen His face.\nHis saints will before long His visage behold,\nE'en in His bright glory will share;\nBut Mary, beholding His tears as He wept,\nCould touch His heart's agony there.\nCould touch His heart's agony there.", "2 We'll soon see the Lord, as He is, face to face,\nWe'll know Him as never before;\nBut that touch today, healing our broken heart,\nIn that day will be felt no more.\nThat day, though our lips offer unceasing praise,\nNo tears, then, nor prayers fervent burn;\nNor is there the comfort received through much pain,\nNor trust gained through trials to learn,\nNor trust gained through trials to learn.", "3 Exceeding in glory, that day we'll be crowned,\nYet there'll be no cross to obey;\nThe sweet fellowship of His suff'rings for us\nWe only can share in today.\nOnce we've that rest entered, no weariness then,\nNor chance will remain to partake\nThe trials nor the hardships, nor happiness lost,\nNor suffering borne for His sake,\nNor suffering borne for His sake.", "4 Oh, chances to suffer for Him are so few,\nHis shame and derision to bear;\nSuch blest opportunities soon pass away,\nThat He in our troubles may share.\nAll loneliness, misunderstandings and scorn\nDespisings and sorrows will flee;\nI treasure these blessings, for through them, O Lord,\nI enter sweet oneness with Thee,\nI enter sweet oneness with Thee.", "5 I long to behold, Lord, Thy countenance soon,\nWhat rapture with Thee, Lord, to meet.\nBut neither seek I all these trials to avoid;\nSuch times, Lord, are too rare and sweet.\nHave mercy on me, fill me with Thy great love,\nFor Thee, Lord, to live at all cost;\nLest Thy servant, hoping for that blessed day,\nThat day, regret chances were lost,\nThat day, regret chances were lost."]
