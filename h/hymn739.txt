{"1": "In those regenerated by the Lord,
There is an inner knowledge bountiful;
Thus we the outward teachings do not need
But God we inwardly may know in full.",
"2": "Eternal life, the highest and the best
Possesses full divine capacity
That by this life God's knowledge we may have,
More than by knowledge given outwardly.",
"3": "The law of life is put within our mind,
And on our heart 'tis written sovereignly
Inwardly ruling us that God we know,
More than by teachings given outwardly.",
"4": "Holy anointing in our spirit dwells
Showing the things of God to mind and heart;
By this anointing we God's knowledge have,
More than man's teachings can to us impart.",
"5": "We have the triune God indwelling us
Living and acting, working all the time
That by the inner sense we have of Him,
God we may know in magnitude sublime.",
"6": "This inner knowledge obviates the need,
Of outward knowledge, human eloquence
But in the spirit we must ever live,
And walk according to the inner sense.",
"7": "The more we live in Christ, the life divine
And by the inner consciousness behave
The more we'll have the inward knowledge true
And on our heart God will His Son engrave.",
"8": "'Tis by this living inward knowledge gained,
That fellowship with God in life we hold;
'Tis by this hidden knowledge thus obtained,
God unto us His fulness doth unfold."}
