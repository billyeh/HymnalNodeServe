{"1": "Thou art fairer than the morning,
O my Savior and my King!
Of Thy grandeur and Thy beauty,
How my soul delights to sing.",
"chorus": "Thou art fairer than the morning,
Thou art brighter, brighter than the day;
At the glory of Thy presence
Clouds and darkness flee away.",
"2": "Clothed in light as with a garment,
Crowned with majesty divine,
Lo, the scepter of dominion
Now and ever, Lord, is Thine.",
"3": "O the greatness of Thy mercy,
And the richness of Thy grace!
O the love that in Thy kingdom
Is preparing me a place!",
"4": "When at last I reach the kingdom,
Win the crown, the battle o'er,
With ten thousand times ten thousand
I shall sing forevermore."}
