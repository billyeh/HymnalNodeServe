["1 Deep down into the depths of this Thy Name,\nMy God, I sink and dwell in calm delight;\nThou art enough however long the day,\nThou art enough however dark the night.", "2 Thou art my God-the All-Sufficient One,\nThou canst create for me whate'er I lack;\nThy mighty hand has strewn the lonely track\nWith miracles of love and tender care", "3 For me Thy trusting one. My God I dare\nOnce more to fling myself upon Thy breast,\nAnd there adore Thy ways in faith's deep rest,\nAnd there adore Thy ways in faith's quiet rest."]
