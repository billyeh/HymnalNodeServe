{"1": "All I have in Adam is but sin and death
I in Christ inherit life and righteousness;
When in flesh abiding, Adam I express
But when in the spirit Christ is manifest.",
"2": "When I am in Adam, though I may not sin
Unto death, a sinner, sentenced I have been;
When in Christ I need not righteously to act
I'm already righteous, justified in fact.",
"3": "In the flesh I need no effort to express,
Marks of Adam's nature and its sinfulness;
In the spirit I need not to strive or strain
I can live as He is and in spirit reign.",
"4": "Thru my death with Christ, from Adam I am free
Thru my life with Christ, new life is given me!
Minding not the flesh, old Adam cannot move
Minding just the spirit, life divine I prove.",
"5": "Minding just the spirit is God's saving way
Minding just the spirit, Christ we will display;
Minding just the spirit, we can overcome
Minding just the spirit, we the race may run.",
"6": "Minding just the spirit, we the cross will know
And His resurrection pow'r thru us will flow;
Minding just the spirit, Christ will.live thru me
And His life within will reach maturity.",
"7": "In the spirit Christ is life and all to me
Strengthening and blessing all-inclusively;
Living in the spirit, holiness I prove
And the triune God within my heart doth move."}
