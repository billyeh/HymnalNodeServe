["1 O happy day that fixed my choice\nOn Thee, my Savior and my God!\nWell may this glowing heart rejoice,\nAnd tell its raptures all abroad.", "chorus Happy day, happy day,\nWhen Jesus washed my sins away!\nHe taught me how to watch and pray,\nAnd live rejoicing every day;\nHappy day, happy day,\nWhen Jesus washed my sins away!", "2 'Tis done-the great transaction's done;\nI am my Lord's, and He is mine;\nHe drew me and I followed on,\nRejoiced to own the call divine.", "3 Now rest, my long-divided heart,\nFixed on this blissful center, rest;\nHere have I found a nobler part,\nHere heav'nly pleasures fill my breast.", "4 High heav'n that hears the solemn vow,\nThat vow renewed shall daily hear!\nTill in life's latest hour I bow,\nAnd bless, in death, a bond so dear."]
