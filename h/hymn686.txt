["1 \"Fear not, I am with thee\";\nBlessed golden ray,\nLike a star of glory,\nLighting up my way!\nThrough the clouds of midnight,\nThis bright promise shone,\n\"I will never leave thee,\nNever will leave thee alone.\"", "chorus No, never alone,\nNo, never alone;\nHe promised never to leave me,\nNever to leave me alone;\nNo, never alone,\nNo, never alone;\nHe promised never to leave me,\nNever to leave me alone.", "2 Roses fade around me,\nLilies bloom and die,\nEarthly sunbeams vanish-\nRadiant still the sky!\nJesus, Henna-flower,*\nBlooming for His own,\nJesus, heaven's sunshine,\nNever will leave me alone.", "3 Steps unseen before me,\nHidden dangers near;\nNearer still my Savior,\nWhispering, \"Be of cheer\";\nJoys, like birds of springtime,\nTo my heart have flown,\nSinging all so sweetly,\n\"He will not leave me alone.\"\nnote: \"An Old World plant, prized for its fragrant yellow and white flowers. (Song of Sol. 1\":14, A.S.V.)"]
