{"1": "Jesus, Name of matchless splendor!
Name all other names above!
Glorious Son of God incarnate,
King of kings, and Lord of love!",
"2": "Name that to our hearts is nearest,
Here the stricken soul doth hide;
Name that to our hearts is dearest,
As in Jesus we confide.",
"3": ""Call Him Jesus!" He shall save us
From the tyranny of sin;
From its condemnation save us,
From iniquity within.",
"4": "Thanks we give, and adoration,
Every day and every hour,
For an uttermost salvation,
Freedom from sin's guilt and power.",
"5": "Jesus! sweetest note of any
In the lowly pilgrim's song;
Jesus! the triumphant music
Of the bright angelic throng.",
"6": "Earth to Him her face upraises,
Knows Him as the great I AM!
Heaven resounds with Jesus' praises,
Glory to the bleeding Lamb!"}
