["1 Jesus, Name of matchless splendor!\nName all other names above!\nGlorious Son of God incarnate,\nKing of kings, and Lord of love!", "2 Name that to our hearts is nearest,\nHere the stricken soul doth hide;\nName that to our hearts is dearest,\nAs in Jesus we confide.", "3 \"Call Him Jesus!\" He shall save us\nFrom the tyranny of sin;\nFrom its condemnation save us,\nFrom iniquity within.", "4 Thanks we give, and adoration,\nEvery day and every hour,\nFor an uttermost salvation,\nFreedom from sin's guilt and power.", "5 Jesus! sweetest note of any\nIn the lowly pilgrim's song;\nJesus! the triumphant music\nOf the bright angelic throng.", "6 Earth to Him her face upraises,\nKnows Him as the great I AM!\nHeaven resounds with Jesus' praises,\nGlory to the bleeding Lamb!"]
