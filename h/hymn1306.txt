{"1": "We love Thy coming, Lord!
We know not when 'twill be,
But turn from all distracting things
Thine own dear face to see.",
"2": "We serve the living God
And wait His Son to see;
For this we need faith, love, and hope,
Increasing constantly.",
"3": "In Thy dear presence, Lord,
We hope we all may be
A crown of glory and a joy
To those we then shall see.",
"4": "We love Thy coming, Lord;
The time is very nigh.
Our hearts unblameable must be
To greet Thee from on high.",
"5": "The Lord Himself shall come
With loud assembling word,
And all the saints in Christ shall be
Forever with the Lord.",
"6": "We're children of the day,
We're children of the light;
That day should never come to us
As does a thief at night.",
"7": "Lord, wholly sanctify
And blameless let us be
In spirit, soul, and body too
For that blest day with Thee."}
