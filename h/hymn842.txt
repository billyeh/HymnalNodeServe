{"1": "Breathe Thou, O Lord, on me
My drooping spirit raise;
Deliver me from fear and death,
Into Thy life of praise.",
"2": "Breathe Thou, O Lord, on me
Strength to my spirit bring
That running, walking, fainting not
I'll mount on eagles' wings.",
"3": "Breathe Thou, O Lord, on me,
That I may enter rest
That heart and spirit joyful be,
By leaning on Thy breast.",
"4": "Breathe Thou, O Lord, on me,
Till filled with Thee, I plead
No longer I that live, but Christ,
In thought, and word, and deed.",
"5": "Breathe Thou on me and touch,
My independency
That in Thy Body I'll be built,
With all the saints in Thee."}
