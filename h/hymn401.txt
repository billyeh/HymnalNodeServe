["1 May the mind of Christ my Savior\nLive in me from day to day,\nBy His love and pow'r controlling\nAll I do and say.", "2 May the Word of Christ dwell richly\nIn my heart from hour to hour,\nSo that all may see I triumph\nOnly through His pow'r.", "3 May the peace of Christ my Savior\nRule my life in every thing,\nThat I may be calm to comfort\nSick and sorrowing.", "4 May the love of Jesus fill me,\nAs the waters fill the sea;\nHim exalting, self abasing,\nThis is victory.", "5 May I run the race before me,\nStrong and brave to face the foe,\nLooking only unto Jesus\nAs I onward go.", "6 May His beauty rest upon me\nAs I seek the lost to win,\nAnd may they forget the channel,\nSeeing only Him."]
