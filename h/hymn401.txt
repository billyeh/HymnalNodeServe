{"1": "May the mind of Christ my Savior
Live in me from day to day,
By His love and pow'r controlling
All I do and say.",
"2": "May the Word of Christ dwell richly
In my heart from hour to hour,
So that all may see I triumph
Only through His pow'r.",
"3": "May the peace of Christ my Savior
Rule my life in every thing,
That I may be calm to comfort
Sick and sorrowing.",
"4": "May the love of Jesus fill me,
As the waters fill the sea;
Him exalting, self abasing,
This is victory.",
"5": "May I run the race before me,
Strong and brave to face the foe,
Looking only unto Jesus
As I onward go.",
"6": "May His beauty rest upon me
As I seek the lost to win,
And may they forget the channel,
Seeing only Him."}
