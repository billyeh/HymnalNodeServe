["1 Recall how David swore,\n\"I'll not come into my house,\nNor go up to my bed,\nGive slumber to mine eyelids,\nUntil I find a place for Thee,\nA place, O Lord, for Thee.\"\nOur mighty God desires a home\nWhere all His own may come.", "2 How blinded we have been,\nShut in with what concerns us;\nWhile God's house lieth waste-\nLord, break through, overturn us;\nWe'll go up to the mountain,\nBring wood and build the house;\nWe'll never say, \"Another day!\"\nIt's time! We'll come and build!", "3 O Lord, against these days,\nInspire some for Your building,\nJust as in Ezra's day-\nA remnant who are willing\nTo come and work in Your house,\nOh, what a blessed charge!\nYour heart's desire, is our desire-\nWe come, O Lord, to build.", "4 Within those whom You'd call\nPut such a restless caring\nFor building to give all-\nThese times are for preparing;\nThe gates of hell cannot prevail\nAgainst the builded Church!\nThe hours are few, the builders too-\nLord, build, O build in us!\nnote: \"(Repeat the last four lines)"]
