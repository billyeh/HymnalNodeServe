["1 He leadeth me! O blessed thought,\nO words with heav'nly comfort fraught;\nWhate'er I do, where'er I be,\nStill 'tis Christ's hand that leadeth me.", "chorus He leadeth me! He leadeth me!\nBy His own hand He leadeth me;\nHis faithful follower I would be,\nFor by His hand He leadeth me.", "2 Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,\nSometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,\nBy waters still, o'er troubled sea,\nStill 'tis His hand that leadeth me.", "3 Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine,\nNor ever murmur or repine;\nContent, whatever lot I see,\nSince it is Thou that leadest me.", "4 And when my task on earth is done,\nWhen, by Thy grace, the vict'ry's won,\nE'en death's cold wave I will not flee,\nSince Thou in triumph leadest me."]
