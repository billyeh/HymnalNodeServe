["1 Once I was bound by sin's galling fetters,\nChained like a slave I struggled in vain;\nBut I received a glorious freedom,\nWhen Jesus broke my fetters in twain.", "chorus Glorious freedom, wonderful freedom,\nNo more in chains of sin I repine!\nJesus the glorious Emancipator,\nNow and forever He shall be mine.", "2 Freedom from all the carnal affections,\nFreedom from envy, hatred and strife;\nFreedom from vain and worldly ambitions.\nFreedom from all that saddened my life.", "3 Freedom from pride and all sinful follies,\nFreedom from love and glitter of gold;\nFreedom from evil temper and anger,\nGlorious freedom, rapture untold.", "4 Freedom from fear with all of its torments,\nFreedom from care with all of its pain;\nFreedom in Christ my blessed Redeemer,\nHe who has rent my fetters in twain."]
