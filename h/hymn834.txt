{"1": "The chief Cornerstone Thou art, Lord
Jewish builders did despise;
God by resurrection placed Thee
Thou art precious in His eyes.
Through Thee we receive salvation
And, together built by Thee
Jews and Gentiles are Thy dwelling
One new man, in harmony.",
"2": "Thou too art the smitten Rock, Lord
That man's thirst by Thee be filled
That frail man may stand upon Thee
But e'en more, God's house to build.
The Foundation Stone in Zion
Tested and secure, Thou art;
And the Rock, the Church supporting
Her foundation to impart.",
"3": "On Thyself the Church is builded
And though many storms assail
Still it stands erect, for 'gainst it,
Gates of hell cannot prevail.
Thine authority possessing
It doth bind and loose in Thee
Bringing men into Thy kingdom
Satan's captives setting free.",
"4": "Living Stone of life art Thou, Lord
Precious, chosen thus to be;
Living stones Thou too hast made us
One in character with Thee.
Built together as a temple,
That our God may dwell therein
Thus we are a holy priesthood
Offering sacrifice to Him.",
"5": "Lord, Thou art the Son of David,
That God's temple Thou may build;
King and Priest Thou art together
That Thy calling be fulfilled.
As the King, for God Thou rulest
Making men submit to Him;
As the Priest before God's presence
Bringing men to enter in.",
"6": "Thine authority doth issue,
From the throne to render peace;
Fellowship is in the river,
To supply and give increase.
When these, balanced, go together
Then God's purpose is fulfilled;
King and Priest in Thee combining
Thou God's dwelling place dost build.",
"7": "Thou art God, yet flesh becamest
God with man in Thee doth dwell;
Thou, the Temple for His glory
God in Thee Himself doth tell.
Thus the Church too is the mingling,
Into one of God and man;
So it is with every member,
For the building of God's plan.",
"8": "Thou, the everlasting Dwelling
In all ages art our home;
We in Thee enjoy protection
Living in Thyself alone.
Thou our Sanctuary art, Lord
We and God abide in Thee;
Thou, God's presence art within us
Where we worship ceaselessly.",
"9": "Cornerstone, Foundation, Topstone
Rock, and Church, and Living Stone
Dwelling-place, and Sanctuary
Builder too art Thou, we own.
Praise we give for what Thou art, Lord
As Thy wondrousness we see!
Grant that we may be built up, Lord
As the living stones in Thee."}
