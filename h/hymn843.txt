{"1": "Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me
I'm as a bone disjoined and dry;
O may Thou quicken and restore me,
And with Thy Body unify.",
"2": "Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me
My spirit is so bound and slow;
O break my shackles and release me
To mingle in Thy Body's flow.",
"3": "Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me
My burdened spirit cannot rise;
May Thou encourage and revive me,
To share Thy Body's full supplies.",
"4": "Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me
My barren spirit has no joy;
O may Thou satisfy and bless me
Thy Body's riches to enjoy.",
"5": "Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me
To me a true dependence give;
Deal with my death and isolation
That in Thy Body I may live."}
