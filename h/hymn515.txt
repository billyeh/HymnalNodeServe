["1 All is in Christ;\nGod's dear Son is Lord of all.\nJesus Christ is life's perfection,\nPerfect love and perfect light.\nSon of God, the true reflection\nOf the Father's radiance bright.\nAll the treasures of God's riches,\nAll the secrets of His wisdom,\nAll in Christ are hid away.\nLet His name be praised today!", "2 All is in Christ;\nGod's dear Son is Lord of all.\nBlessings are imparted to us\nBy the shameful cross He bore.\nBy His suffering inglorious\nWe have peace forevermore.\nBy the Cross we have forgiveness,\nLife eternal, endless mercy.\nBy God's Son is freely giv'n\nEverything in earth and heav'n.", "3 All is in Christ;\nGod's dear Son is Lord of all.\nIn me there is naught but weakness,\nI am worthless, full of sin,\nStricken by its mortal sickness,\nLacking light and hope within.\nNow in Christ I find abundant\nVictory and strength and power.\nSavior, come and live in me,\nCome and make me rich in Thee.", "4 All is in Christ;\nGod's dear Son is Lord of all.\nSavior, pardon my transgressions,\nFor my love is still so small;\nThough I gave all my possessions,\nThis would profit scarce at all.\n'Tis myself that Thou desirest;\nSo I give myself, dear Master;\nNo thing hast Thou kept from me-\nNor will I keep aught from Thee.", "5 All is in Christ;\nYour whole self present to Him.\nVain your quest for lasting pleasure,\nWealth, success, and worldly fame;\nChrist alone must be your treasure,\nHis resource your only claim.\nCome, let Him disperse the famine\nOf your arid, waste existence.\nLet God's Son, th' Immortal King\nFreely give you everything."]
