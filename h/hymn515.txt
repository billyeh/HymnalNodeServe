{"1": "All is in Christ;
God's dear Son is Lord of all.
Jesus Christ is life's perfection,
Perfect love and perfect light.
Son of God, the true reflection
Of the Father's radiance bright.
All the treasures of God's riches,
All the secrets of His wisdom,
All in Christ are hid away.
Let His name be praised today!",
"2": "All is in Christ;
God's dear Son is Lord of all.
Blessings are imparted to us
By the shameful cross He bore.
By His suffering inglorious
We have peace forevermore.
By the Cross we have forgiveness,
Life eternal, endless mercy.
By God's Son is freely giv'n
Everything in earth and heav'n.",
"3": "All is in Christ;
God's dear Son is Lord of all.
In me there is naught but weakness,
I am worthless, full of sin,
Stricken by its mortal sickness,
Lacking light and hope within.
Now in Christ I find abundant
Victory and strength and power.
Savior, come and live in me,
Come and make me rich in Thee.",
"4": "All is in Christ;
God's dear Son is Lord of all.
Savior, pardon my transgressions,
For my love is still so small;
Though I gave all my possessions,
This would profit scarce at all.
'Tis myself that Thou desirest;
So I give myself, dear Master;
No thing hast Thou kept from me-
Nor will I keep aught from Thee.",
"5": "All is in Christ;
Your whole self present to Him.
Vain your quest for lasting pleasure,
Wealth, success, and worldly fame;
Christ alone must be your treasure,
His resource your only claim.
Come, let Him disperse the famine
Of your arid, waste existence.
Let God's Son, th' Immortal King
Freely give you everything."}
