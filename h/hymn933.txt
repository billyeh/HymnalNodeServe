{"1": "I have a Savior, He's pleading in glory,
A dear loving Savior, though earth-friends be few;
And now He is watching in tenderness o'er me,
But oh, that my Savior were your Savior too!",
"chorus": "For you I am praying,
For you I am praying,
For you I am praying,
I'm praying for you.",
"2": "I have a Father: "to me He has given
A hope for eternity, blessed and true;
He'll call me one day to the kingdom of heaven,
But oh, that He'd let me bring you with me too!",
"3": "I have a peace: "it is calm as a river,
A peace that the friends of this world never knew;
My Savior alone is its Author and Giver,
And oh, could I know it was given to you!"}
