["1 Jesus, Thy head, once crown'd with thorns,\nIs crown'd with glory now;\nHeaven's royal diadem adorns\nThe mighty Victor's brow.", "2 Thou glorious light of courts above,\nJoy of the saints below,\nTo us still manifest Thy love,\nThat we its depths may know.", "3 To us Thy cross with all its shame,\nWith all its grace be giv'n;\nThough earth disowns Thy lowly name,\nGod honors it in heav'n.", "4 Who suffer with Thee, Lord, today,\nShall also with Thee reign:\nThen let it be our joy to pay\nThe Price, this goal attain.", "5 To us Thy cross is life and health;\n'Twas shame and death to Thee;\nOur present glory, joy and wealth,\nOur everlasting stay."]
