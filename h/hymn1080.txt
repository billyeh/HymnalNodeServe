{"1": "What profit all the labor here?
There's nothing new for you and me!
Remember not the former things
They're all vanity!",
"chorus": "Vanity! Vanity!
Vanity! Vanity!
'Tis chasing the wind
It's all vanity!",
"2": "Man's life is full of grief and pain:
Much wisdom bringeth misery!
Increasing knowledge addeth woe!
It's all vanity!",
"3": "What good our pleasure and our wealth?
Though joys we have and family
We'll have our worries just the same!
It's all vanity!",
"4": "Days of toil to gain and restless nights:
Though gained without calamity
When death comes it is gone for aye!
It's all vanity!",
"5": "Remember God in days of youth!
Fear Him, and such will be your gain!
With Him you will be satisfied
For He is not vain!",
"chorus": "Christ without, all is vain!
Christ within, all is gain!
All things are vain
Christ only is gain!"}
