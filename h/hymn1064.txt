["1 I love to tell the story\nOf unseen things above,\nOf Jesus and His glory,\nOf Jesus and His love.\nI love to tell the story,\nBecause I know 'tis true;\nIt satisfies my longings\nAs nothing else can do.", "chorus I love to tell the story,\n'Twill be my theme in glory\nTo tell the old, old story\nof Jesus and His love.", "2 I love to tell the story;\nMore wonderful it seems\nThan all the golden fancies\nOf all my golden dreams,\nI love to tell the story,\nIt did so much for me;\nAnd that is just the reason\nI tell it now to thee.", "3 I love to tell the story;\n'Tis pleasant to repeat\nWhat seems each time I tell it,\nMore wonderfully sweet.\nI love to tell the story;\nFor some have never heard\nThe message of salvation\nFrom God's own holy Word.", "4 I love to tell the story;\nFor those who know it best\nSeem hungering and thirsting\nTo hear it like the rest.\nAnd when, in scenes of glory,\nI sing the new, new song,\n'Twill be the old, old story,\nThat I have loved so long."]
