["1 We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender;\nWe go not forth alone against the foe;\nStrong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender.\nWe rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.", "2 Yea, in Thy Name, O Captain of salvation!\nIn Thy dear Name, all other names above;\nJesus our Righteousness, our sure Foundation,\nOur Prince of glory and our King of love.", "3 We go in faith, our own great weakness feeling,\nAnd needing more each day Thy grace to know:\nYet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing;\nWe rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.", "4 We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender:\nThine is the battle, Thine shall be the praise\nWhen reigning in the Kingdom of Thy splendor;\nVictors, we rest with Thee, through endless days."]
