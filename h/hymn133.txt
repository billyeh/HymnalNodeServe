With glory ever crowned;
In power and in majesty,

A slave-form Thou didst own;
As man in God, in heav'n Thou art
As Lord of all art known.",

And there by God enthroned;
All pow'r in heaven and on earth,
Now by Thyself is owned.",

And giv'n the highest Name
All shall confess Thee as the Lord,
And all bow at Thy Name.",

God's throne by Thee is shared.",

To Thee our song we raise;
We worship Thee as Lord of all
How worthy of our praise!"}
