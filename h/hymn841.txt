{"1": "Thou art all my life, Lord
In me Thou dost live;
With Thee all God's fulness,
Thou to me dost give.
By Thy holy nature,
I am sanctified
By Thy resurrection
Vict'ry is supplied.",
"2": "Now Thy flowing life, Lord
Doth enlighten me
Bringing in the spirit,
Fellowship with Thee;
All my need supplying
Making Thy demand
Leading me to cleansing,
And in Thee to stand.",
"3": "Thy anointing Spirit,
Me shall permeate
All my soul and spirit,
Thou wouldst saturate;
Every part transforming,
Till conformed to Thee
Till Thy life shall bring me,
To maturity.",
"4": "Lord, Thy life abundant
Flowing, rich and free
Constantly refreshes,
And empowers me.
Death by life is swallowed
Weakness is made strong
All my bonds are broken
Gloom is turned to song.",
"5": "I would give myself, Lord
Fully unto Thee
That Thy heart's desire,
Be fulfilled in me.
I no more would struggle,
To myself reform
Thus in me to hinder,
What Thou wouldst perform.",
"6": "I would cease completely,
From my efforts vain
Let Thy life transform me
Full release to gain;
Build me up with others,
Till in us Thou see,
Thy complete expression,
Glorifying Thee."}
