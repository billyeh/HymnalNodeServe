{"1": "Our God is living-say, Hallelujah!
He's living in us-say, Hallelujah!
We taste His riches,
He is our portion.
Just say 'O Lord' to taste and see.",
"2": "We come together-there's nothing better-
For in the Spirit we are His family,
His living Body!
We just express Him.
Jesus is our reality.",
"3": "In all the churches we're being filled now
For the saturation throughout the nation,
To spread our Jesus
To every city-
This land will see the living Christ."}
