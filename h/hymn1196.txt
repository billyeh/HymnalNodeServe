["1 Our God is living-say, Hallelujah!\nHe's living in us-say, Hallelujah!\nWe taste His riches,\nHe is our portion.\nJust say 'O Lord' to taste and see.", "2 We come together-there's nothing better-\nFor in the Spirit we are His family,\nHis living Body!\nWe just express Him.\nJesus is our reality.", "3 In all the churches we're being filled now\nFor the saturation throughout the nation,\nTo spread our Jesus\nTo every city-\nThis land will see the living Christ."]
