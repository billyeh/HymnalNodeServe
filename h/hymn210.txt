["1 I've found a friend in Jesus, He's everything to me,\nHe's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;\nThe Apple-tree of trees, in Him alone I see\nAll I need to cleanse and make me fully whole.\nIn sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay,\nHe tells me every care on Him to roll:\nHe's the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and Morning Star,\nHe's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.", "2 He all my griefs has taken, and all my sorrows borne;\nIn temptation He's my strong and mighty tower;\nI've all for Him forsaken, and all my idols torn\nFrom my heart, and now He keeps me by His power.\nThough all the world forsake me, and Satan tempt me sore,\nThrough Jesus I shall safely reach the goal:\nHe's the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and Morning Star,\nHe's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.", "3 He'll never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here,\nWhile I live by faith and do His blessed will;\nA wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear,\nWith His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.\nThen sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face,\nWhere rivers of delight shall ever roll:\nHe's the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and Morning Star,\nHe's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul."]
