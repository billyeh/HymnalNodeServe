{"1": "God our Father, we adore Thee
For the sake of righteousness;
Thou in Christ hast justified us
Who our conscience can depress?
Thou art righteous, and art faithful
On Thy righteousness we stand;
No unrighteousness is in Thee
None can turn Thy righteous hand.",
"2": "Thou hast laid our sins on Jesus
By Thy justice He was killed;
All Thy holy law's requirements,
For Thy justice He fulfilled.
Recompense from Him receiving
Thou art fully satisfied;
How couldst Thou, O God most righteous
Claim it once more from our side?",
"3": "Father God, Thou hast accepted,
Jesus as our Substitute;
Judged the Just One for the unjust
Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?
As a proof of perfect justice
At Thine own right hand He sits;
He, as Thy full satisfaction
Righteously Thy need befits.",
"4": "Father, through the blood of Jesus,
We possess Thy righteousness;
By Thy righteousness protected
None can shake our stedfastness.
Righteousness of Thine Thou mad'st us
None can ever us condemn;
We'll forever testify this,
In the new Jerusalem."}
