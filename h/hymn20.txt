["1 God our Father, we adore Thee\nFor the sake of righteousness;\nThou in Christ hast justified us\nWho our conscience can depress?\nThou art righteous, and art faithful\nOn Thy righteousness we stand;\nNo unrighteousness is in Thee\nNone can turn Thy righteous hand.", "2 Thou hast laid our sins on Jesus\nBy Thy justice He was killed;\nAll Thy holy law's requirements,\nFor Thy justice He fulfilled.\nRecompense from Him receiving\nThou art fully satisfied;\nHow couldst Thou, O God most righteous\nClaim it once more from our side?", "3 Father God, Thou hast accepted,\nJesus as our Substitute;\nJudged the Just One for the unjust\nCouldst Thou change Thy attitude?\nAs a proof of perfect justice\nAt Thine own right hand He sits;\nHe, as Thy full satisfaction\nRighteously Thy need befits.", "4 Father, through the blood of Jesus,\nWe possess Thy righteousness;\nBy Thy righteousness protected\nNone can shake our stedfastness.\nRighteousness of Thine Thou mad'st us\nNone can ever us condemn;\nWe'll forever testify this,\nIn the new Jerusalem."]
