["1 Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,\nUttered, or unexpressed;\nThe motion of a hidden fire\nThat trembles in the breast.", "2 Prayer is the burden of a sigh,\nThe falling of a tear;\nThe upward glancing of an eye\nWhen none but God is near.", "3 Prayer is the simplest form of speech\nThat infant lips can try;\nPrayer the sublimest strains that reach\nThe Majesty on high.", "4 Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,\nThe Christian's native air;\nHis watchword at the gates of death;\nHe enters rest with prayer.", "5 The saints in prayer appear as one,\nIn word, and deed, and mind;\nWhile with the Father and the Son\nSweet fellowship they find.", "6 O Thou, by whom we come to God,\nThe Life, the Truth, the Way,\nThe path of prayer Thyself hast trod-\nLord, teach us how to pray."]
