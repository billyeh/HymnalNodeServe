["1 Christ indeed was born of Spirit,\nWhen He came a man to be;\nAnd before His service started\nWith the Spirit filled was He.\nYet He still received the baptism,\nOf the Spirit from on high,\nWhen He came to start His service,\nAnd was clothed with pow'r thereby.", "2 Peter and the Lord's disciples,\nAll were Spirit born and filled\nBreathing in the Holy Spirit,\nAs on them Christ breathed and willed.\nYet they still received the baptism,\nOf the Spirit from on high,\nWhen they were equipped for service\nAnd were clothed with pow'r thereby.", "3 Saul of Tarsus, the Ephesians\nAnd Samaritans believed;\nThus by Spirit generated\nOf His fulness they received.\nYet they still received the baptism,\nOf the Spirit from on high,\nWhen some laid their hands upon them\nAnd were clothed with pow'r thereby.", "4 We are also born of Spirit,\nOn the day when we believe\nAnd of Him we now are drinking,\nAs we daily Him receive.\nYet we also must be baptized,\nWith the Spirit from on high\nThus to be equipped for service\nAnd be clothed with pow'r thereby.", "5 Lord, baptize us with Thy Spirit!\nThis is what we need today;\nClothe us with Thy heav'nly power\nBring us under its full sway.\nOh, baptize us in this hour!\nThis is all our earnest cry;\nNow on us repeat Thine answer\nClothe with power from on high."]
