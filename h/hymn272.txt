{"1": "Christ indeed was born of Spirit,
When He came a man to be;
And before His service started
With the Spirit filled was He.
Yet He still received the baptism,
Of the Spirit from on high,
When He came to start His service,
And was clothed with pow'r thereby.",
"2": "Peter and the Lord's disciples,
All were Spirit born and filled
Breathing in the Holy Spirit,
As on them Christ breathed and willed.
Yet they still received the baptism,
Of the Spirit from on high,
When they were equipped for service
And were clothed with pow'r thereby.",
"3": "Saul of Tarsus, the Ephesians
And Samaritans believed;
Thus by Spirit generated
Of His fulness they received.
Yet they still received the baptism,
Of the Spirit from on high,
When some laid their hands upon them
And were clothed with pow'r thereby.",
"4": "We are also born of Spirit,
On the day when we believe
And of Him we now are drinking,
As we daily Him receive.
Yet we also must be baptized,
With the Spirit from on high
Thus to be equipped for service
And be clothed with pow'r thereby.",
"5": "Lord, baptize us with Thy Spirit!
This is what we need today;
Clothe us with Thy heav'nly power
Bring us under its full sway.
Oh, baptize us in this hour!
This is all our earnest cry;
Now on us repeat Thine answer
Clothe with power from on high."}
