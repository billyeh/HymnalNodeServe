{"1": "It's by our mingled spirit, Lord,
That we can shine with Thee,
And be a golden lampstand now
For all the world to see.
It's not by forms or rituals,
Mere Christianity;
It's by our Christ enjoyed as life
We all can shine with Thee.",
"2": "The burning Christ has feet as brass
Which in the furnace bums,
His eyes are as a flame of fire-
'Tis to this Christ we turn!
How could we ever lukewarm be
When on His face we gaze?
O Lord, we give ourselves to You
To set us all ablaze!",
"3": "The seven golden lampstands in
The seven cities see,
So burning, shining with this Christ,
It's God's economy!
We're absolute that this become
Our full reality
Upon the earth, within the church
In each locality."}
