["1 Lord, I would have Thyself in all Thy beauty,\nTake Thou control of all my life just now;\nIn Thee to live, and move, and have my being,\nWith full abandon, Lord, to Thee I bow.", "chorus Thy blood was shed to cleanse from sin, Lord Jesus,\nThy risen life transforms the old to new;\nI take my stand upon Thy word of promise:\nSin shall not have dominion over you!", "2 Show me the things of which I am unconscious,\nLord, put Thy finger now upon my heart;\nWhisper to me, through Thy blest Holy Spirit,\nTell me what grieves Him, that it may depart.", "3 Thou art my Victor over keen temptation,\nThou art my Shield, to meet the darts of sin;\nLord Jesus, Thou alone can keep me trusting,\nAnd living out Thy glorious life within."]
