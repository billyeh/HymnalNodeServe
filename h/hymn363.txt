{"1": "Lord, I would have Thyself in all Thy beauty,
Take Thou control of all my life just now;
In Thee to live, and move, and have my being,
With full abandon, Lord, to Thee I bow.",
"chorus": "Thy blood was shed to cleanse from sin, Lord Jesus,
Thy risen life transforms the old to new;
I take my stand upon Thy word of promise:
Sin shall not have dominion over you!",
"2": "Show me the things of which I am unconscious,
Lord, put Thy finger now upon my heart;
Whisper to me, through Thy blest Holy Spirit,
Tell me what grieves Him, that it may depart.",
"3": "Thou art my Victor over keen temptation,
Thou art my Shield, to meet the darts of sin;
Lord Jesus, Thou alone can keep me trusting,
And living out Thy glorious life within."}
