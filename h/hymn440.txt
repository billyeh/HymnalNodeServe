["1 Holy, happy separation!\nThey alone are truly blest\nWho from all besides retiring,\nAnd Himself alone desiring\nFind in Jesus only rest,\nFind in Jesus only rest.", "2 Jesus calls to separation,\nAnd Himself hath led the way;\nHis own life the explanation,\nHis own life the illustration\nWho is ready to obey?\nWho is ready to obey?", "3 Blessed Jesus, make us willing,\nThus without the camp to go\nUnto Thee in glad subjection,\nUnto Thee in Thy rejection,\nUnto Thee from all below,\nUnto Thee from all below!", "4 Separate from all that grieves Thee,\nSeparate from sinners too;\nYet, like Thee, for sinners caring,\nAnd, like Thee, with sinners bearing,\nAsking, \"What would Jesus do?\"\nAsking, \"What would Jesus do?\"", "5 Unto Thee! Beloved Master,\nNearer, nearer let us be\nUnto Thee in consecration,\nUnto Thee in separation,\nEver, only, unto Thee,\nEver, only, unto Thee!"]
