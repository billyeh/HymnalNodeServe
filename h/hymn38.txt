{"1": "Of all the gifts Thy love bestows,
Thou Giver of all good.
E'en heav'n itself no richer knows
Than Jesus and His blood.",
"2": "Faith, too, that trusts in Him through grace,
From that same love we gain;
Else, sweetly as it suits our case,
The gift had been in vain.",
"3": "We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more,
To Thee our all we owe:
The precious Savior, and the power
That makes Him precious too."}
