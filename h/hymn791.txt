He sacrifices e'er to God
Beholds His beauty, incense burns,
Of prayer before the Lord.

"chorus": "Let us the incense burn,
Of prayer before the Lord;
The lamp we'd light, through day and night,
Our praise to Him outpoured.",

Within the holy place gives sight;
Whene'er the priest the incense burns
The lamp he too must light.",
"3": "The grace of God let us extol,
And stir our heart sweet praise to sing;
For priests not only light the lamp
But constant praises bring.",

Christ's resurrection bring therein
God's wish thus meet, His heart give joy
And I'll rejoice with Him.",
"5": "I'll read His Word, His light receive
E'en as the lamp before Him lit
His holy light illum'ning me,
To others I'll transmit.",
"6": "Unto the Lord His praise I'll sing,
As holy priests their songs did raise;
O may my heart be filled with Him,
His love and grace to praise.",
"7": "I'll offer Christ to God in prayer
I'll read the Word, His light to know
For all His grace I'll sing His praise
The Spirit then may flow."}
