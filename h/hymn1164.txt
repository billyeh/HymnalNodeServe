["1 Jesus, the all-inclusive land,\nIs everything to me:\nA Christ of brooks, of depths and streams,\nAnd fountains bubbling free.\nSpringing from valleys and from hills,\nFlowing till every part He fills,\nHe waters us-how glorious-\nBy His life!", "2 Jesus is now the land of wheat-\nIncarnate, crucified.\nBut resurrection life is He\nBy barley signified.\nHe is a land of figs and vines-\nBlood of the grape, the cheering wine.\nWith such supplies He satisfies-\nChrist our land!", "3 O what a rich, abundant Christ:\nOur pomegranate true,\nThe olive tree whose oil is now\nAnointing us anew.\nRich milk and honey He doth bring,\nSweet, satisfying, nourishing.\nOur Christ is such; He is so much!\nWhat a Christ!", "4 In our good land we eat the bread-\nThere is no scarcity.\nWe never lack one thing in Him,\nSo rich, so full is He.\nHe is a land so vast, immense;\nHe is complete in every sense.\nHow He expands-land of all lands-\nIn our heart!", "5 Christ is a land of iron stones,\nWhence comes authority.\nWe must dig out this solid Christ\nTo bind His enemy.\nThen we must through the sufferings pass\nTo be refined as burnished brass.\nWith iron bind, as brass refined,\nIs our need.", "6 Lord, how we bless Thee for this land,\nThe all-inclusive Christ!\nWe've eaten Him, we're filled with Him,\nO how He has sufficed!\nTeach us to labor constantly\nUpon this vast reality;\nThis is our joy, this our employ-\nChrist our land!"]
