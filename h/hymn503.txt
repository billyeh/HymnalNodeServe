["1 I serve a risen Savior\nHe's in the world today.\nI know that He is living,\nWhatever men may say.\nI see His hand of mercy;\nI hear His voice of cheer;\nAnd just the time I need Him\nHe's always near.", "chorus He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!\nHe walks with me and talks with me along life's narrow way.\nHe lives, He lives, salvation to impart!\nYou ask me how I know He lives?\nHe lives within my heart.", "2 In all the world around me\nI see His loving care,\nAnd though my heart grows weary,\nI never will despair;\nI know that He is leading,\nThrough all the stormy blast;\nThe day of His appearing\nWill come at last.", "3 Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian,\nLift up your voice and sing\nEternal hallelujahs\nTo Jesus Christ the King!\nThe Hope of all who seek Him,\nThe Help of all who find,\nNone other is so loving,\nSo good and kind."]
