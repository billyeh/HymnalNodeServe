["1 The love of Christ constraineth;\nOh, let the watchword ring\nTill all the world adoring\nTo Jesus' feet it bring.\nTill north and south the kingdoms\nShall own His glorious sway,\nAnd east and west the nations\nRejoice to see His Day.", "2 The love of Christ constraineth;\nAt home, abroad, where'er\nBy sea or shore abiding\nHis Name and mark we bear.\nWe ask not that our service\nOr great or small may be,\nIf only Thou wilt own it,\nDear Lord, as unto Thee.", "3 The love of Christ constraineth;\nAnd we who trust His Word,\nWho know and feel its power\nTo gladder service stirred,\nShall neither faint nor falter,\nThough dark the night and long,\nAnd weak our hands that labor;\nHis strength shall make us strong.", "4 The love of Christ constraineth,\nThen let us work and pray,\nAnd watch the glad appearing\nOf that triumphant day,\nWhen Father, Son, and Spirit,\nBy every tongue confessed,\nAll earth His broad dominion\nIn His dear love shall rest."]
