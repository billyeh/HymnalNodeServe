{"1": "The image of the Father God
Lord, we behold in Thee;
The fulness of the Godhead true,
In Thee dwells bodily.",
"2": "Lord, Thou art God's eternal Word,
With life divine in Thee;
In Thee His grace we all receive,
With His reality.",
"3": "Effulgence of God's glory true
The Son of God art Thou;
The very substance of Himself,
In Thee we all avow.",
"4": "Embodiment of God Thou art
And with Him ever one;
In Thee is God expressed to us,
Beyond comparison.",
"5": "God we enjoy in Thee, dear Lord
As life and everything;
To Thee and God our heartfelt thanks,
And praise we'll ever bring."}
