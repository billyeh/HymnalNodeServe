{"1": "All the saints of Christ are,
Members every one;
All coordinating,
Into oneness come.",
"2": "Though the gifts are many
Yet the Spirit one;
Many too the functions
But one Lord, the Son.",
"3": "Each, the others needing
Must impartial be;
Each his place possesses,
And utility.",
"4": "By our grace are measured,
Gifts both large and small;
Each with sober judgment,
Takes his place with all.",
"5": "Each fulfills his duty
Shows his usefulness
Fervent in the spirit
Girt with faithfulness.",
"6": "Knitting and supplying
Bearing much in grace;
Not a trace of discord
Christ is giv'n His place.",
"7": "We, the Church, His Body
He, the Head, the Son;
By the Spirit's flowing
We are joined in one."}
