{"1": "We were held in bondage, toiling down
in Egypt land,
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
But the God of Hebrews rescued us
from Pharaoh's hand,
Glory to God, Hallelujah!",
"chorus": "We will sing unto the Lord
for His mighty victory,
For the rider and the horse
He has cast into the sea.
Now the dwelling place of God
on the earth will builded be,
Glory to God, Hallelujah!",
"2": "Now we're on the other side, we'll go
back nevermore!
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
Look! Th' Egyptians all are lying dead
upon the shore!
Glory to God, Hallelujah!",
"3": "Brothers, sisters- Hallelujah! Through
the sea we've crossed,
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
All the things that used to hold us
are forever lost!
Glory to God, Hallelujah!",
"4": "We're the Hebrews, now we're standing
on the sea of glass,
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
And we sing the song of Moses,
everything we've passed,
Glory to God, Hallelujah!"}
