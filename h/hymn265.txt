{"1": "Where the sprinkling of the blood is
There the ointment doth remain;
Man in touch with God thus bringing
These the fellowship maintain.",
"2": "Blood, the emblem of redemption
Cleansing all the sins away;
Ointment, symbol of the Spirit
Bringing God to man for aye.",
"3": "Blood doth speak of what God worketh
Ointment, what He is for us;
By His work and by His person,
God Himself is blent with us.",
"4": "By the blood of Christ's redemption,
We are cleansed from all alloy;
By th' anointing of the Spirit,
God Himself we may enjoy.",
"5": "By the cleansing and anointing,
We with God are kept in one;
By the blood and by the ointment,
God, our portion full, is won.",
"6": "We in faith must claim the cleansing,
When we need the precious blood
Ever to obey th' anointing
Thus to live and walk with God.",
"7": "God as light we'll then be knowing
God experience as love
And in God as life e'er growing
God as power we will prove."}
