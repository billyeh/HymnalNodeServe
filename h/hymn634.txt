{"1": "Cross of Christ! lead onward,
Through the holy war;
In this sign we conquer
Now and evermore.
Not of man the power,
Not to man the fame;
We are victors only
In our Leader's name.",
"chorus": "Cross of Christ! lead onward,
Through the holy war;
In this sign we conquer
Now and evermore.",
"2": "Not with pomp and pageant,
Not in earthly pride;
We must fight our battles
Like the Crucified.
Overcome by suff'ring,
Conquer through defeat;
Tried and tested daily
In the furnace heat.",
"3": "Kind, yet we are fighting,
Bold, yet humbly meek;
Resting while we're working,
Strong, but ever weak.
Timid, though courageous,
Gaining as we give;
Crucified with Jesus,
Yet, in Him, we live.",
"4": "By a cloud encompassed,
Witnesses to prove,
Saints, apostles, prophets,
Precious ones we love;
While "advance!" is sounding,
Mounts the battle thrill.
Cross of Christ! lead onward
Where the Captain will.",
"5": "Marching in the pathway
That the Master trod,
Walks One daily with us
Like the Son of God.
To the end enduring,
Armor ne'er laid down,
Till the Cross leads upward
To the blood-bought crown."}
