{"1": "What joy fills my heart, fills my heart, fills my heart,
What joy fills my heart!
God takes my stone heart, one of flesh imparts;
His Spirit renewing gives life to each part.
What joy fills my heart, fills my heart, fills my heart.",
"2": "Oh, His Spirit fills, fills me now, fills me now!
Oh, His Spirit fills!
He drives out my sin, weakness, death, within,
To bear fruits of righteousness, holy to Him.
Oh, His Spirit fills, fills me now, fills me now!"}
