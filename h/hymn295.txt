["1 God's Christ, who is my righteousness,\nMy beauty is, my glorious dress;\nMidst flaming worlds, in this arrayed,\nWith joy shall I lift up my head.", "2 Lord, I believe Thy precious blood,\nWhich, at the mercy seat of God,\nForever doth for sinners plead,\nFor me, e'en for my soul, was shed.", "3 Lord, I believe were sinners more\nThan sands upon the ocean shore,\nThou hast for all a ransom paid,\nFor all a full redemption made.", "4 Bold can I stand in every way,\nFor who aught to my charge shall lay?\nFully, by Thee, absolved I am\nFrom sin and fear, from guilt and shame.", "5 This spotless robe the same appears,\nWhen ruined nature sinks in years;\nNo age can change its glorious hue,\nIts glory is forever new.", "6 Thou God of power, Thou God of love,\nLet all Thy saints Thy mercy prove;\nOur beauty this, our glorious dress,\nJesus the Lord, our Righteousness."]
