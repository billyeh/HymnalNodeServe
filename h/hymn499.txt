{"1": "Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!
The Christ who's all within me lives.
With Him I have been crucified;
This glorious fact to me He gives.
Now it's no longer I that live
But Christ the Lord within me lives.",
"2": "Oh, what a joy! Oh, what a rest!
Christ now is being formed in me.
His very nature and life divine,
In my whole being inwrought shall be.
All that I am came to an end
And all of Christ is all to me.",
"3": "Oh, what a thought! Oh, what a boast!
Christ shall in me be magnified.
In nothing shall I be ashamed
For He in all shall be applied.
In woe or blessing, death or life
Through me shall Christ be testified.",
"4": "Oh, what a prize! Oh, what a gain!
Christ is the goal toward which I press.
Nothing I treasure, nor aught desire
But Christ of all-inclusiveness.
My hope, my glory, and my crown,
Is Christ, the One of peerlessness.
(Repeat the last two lines of each stanza)"}
