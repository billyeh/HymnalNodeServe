{"1": "Jesus hath died and hath risen again,
Pardon and peace to bestow;
Fully I trust Him; from sin's guilty stain,
Jesus saves me now.",
"chorus": "Jesus saves me now,
Jesus saves me now;
Yes, Jesus saves me all the time;
Jesus saves me now.",
"2": "Sin's condemnation is over and gone,
Jesus alone knoweth how;
Life and salvation my soul hath put on:
Jesus saves me now.",
"3": "Satan may tempt, but he never shall reign,
That Christ will never allow;
Doubts I have buried, and this is my strain,
Jesus saves me now.",
"4": "Resting in Jesus, abiding in Him,
Gladly my faith can avow,
Never again need my pathway be dim:
Jesus saves me now.",
"5": "Jesus is stronger than Satan and sin,
Satan to Jesus must bow;
Therefore I triumph without and within:
Jesus saves me now.",
"6": "Sorrow and pain may beset me about,
Nothing can darken my brow;
Battling in faith, I can joyfully shout:
"Jesus saves me now.""}
