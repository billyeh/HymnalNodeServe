["1 Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,\nWhen the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;\nFairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,\nDawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee.", "2 As in the dawning, o'er the waveless ocean,\nThe image of the morning star doth rest,\nSo in this stillness Thou beholdest only\nThine image in the waters of my breast.", "3 When sinks the soul, subdued by toil, to slumber,\nIts closing eye looks up to Thee in prayer;\nSweet the repose, beneath Thy wings o'ershadowing,\nBut sweeter still to wake and find Thee there.", "4 So shall it be at last, in that bright morning\nWhen the soul waketh, and life's shadows flee;\nOh, in that hour, fairer than daylight's dawning,\nShall rise the glorious thought, I am with Thee!"]
