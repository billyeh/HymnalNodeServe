["1 The scribes and Pharisees all thought\nA leader great would come.\nSo they to John the Baptist came\nTo ask if he's the One.\n\"Art thou the Coming One?\" they asked,\nTo which he made reply:\n\"I'm not the Christ-I am not He-\nA voice, that's all, am I.\"", "2 And on the morrow, John stood there\nAnd spoke to two or three.\nAnd as he lifted up his eyes,\nHe then did Jesus see.\nHe said, \"Behold the Lamb of God,\n'Tis He Who walks this way.\nHe's here to take the sins of all\nAnd bear them all away!\"", "3 Yet poor religion counted not\nThese things of any worth,\nBut seeking for a leader great\nIt lingered on in dearth;\nAnd looking for a movement strong,\nContinued in its strife.\nPreoccupied with all these things,\nThey missed the Lord of LIFE!", "4 Religion is Christ's enemy,\nIt's even so today.\nFor though they name Him, should He come,\nThey'd put the Lord away.\nThey did it then, they'd do it now,\nThey'd miss the Lord again.\nSo let us seek the Lord Himself,\nThe lamb, the dove obtain.", "5 Now in the Lord's recovery\nWe're drawn to Christ alone.\nThe Spirit as the gentle dove\nHas found in us a home.\nLet all religion turn away\nTo movements wide and great;\nThis testimony of Himself\nOur Lord will vindicate!"]
