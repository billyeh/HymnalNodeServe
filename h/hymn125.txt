["1 Hallelujah! sing to Jesus,\nHis the scepter, His the throne;\nHallelujah! His the triumph,\nHis the victory alone.\nHark, the songs of His redeemed ones\nThunder like a mighty flood:\nJesus out of every nation\nHath redeemed us by His blood.", "2 Hallelujah! not as orphans\nAre we left in sorrow now;\nHallelujah! He is near us,\nFaith believes, nor questions how.\nThough the clouds from sight received Him\nWhen the forty days were o'er,\nShall our hearts forget His promise,\n\"I am with you evermore\"?", "3 Hallelujah! Bread of heaven,\nThou on earth our food, our stay;\nHallelujah! here the hungry\nCome to Thee from day to day.\nAdvocate and Intercessor,\nMy Redeemer pleads for me,\nOn the throne of the Almighty\nNow and to eternity.", "4 Hallelujah! sing to Jesus,\nHis the scepter, His the throne;\nHallelujah! His the triumph,\nHis the victory alone.\nHark, the songs of His redeemed ones\nThunder like a mighty flood:\nJesus out of every nation,\nHath redeemed us by His blood."]
