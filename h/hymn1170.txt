{"1": "The Lord is my Shepherd forever,
He maketh me down to lie,
He leads me beside the still waters
O how He does satisfy!",
"chorus": "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days, all the days of my life;
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days, all the days of my life.
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,
And I shall feast at the table spread for me;
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days, all the days of my life.",
"2": "My Shepherd Himself is my pasture,
My Shepherd, the waters of rest;
I eat of His riches in spirit,
I drink, and O how I am blest!",
"3": "My Shepherd my soul is restoring,
My will, and emotion, and mind;
And though through the valley I'm walking,
O what a Companion I find!",
"4": "A table prepared by my Shepherd
I feast on and Satan destroy;
My head is anointed with oil,
My cup runneth over with joy!",
"5": "And now in His house I am dwelling
Enjoying the goodness of God;
My pleasure is far beyond telling,
My pleasure is Jesus my Lord!"}
