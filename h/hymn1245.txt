{"1": "When the brothers are in order,
And you sense Christ is their life,
Follow them and watch for Jesus,
Ending thus your thought and strife.",
"chorus": "Follow brothers, follow sisters,
When you sense Christ is their life,
Follow brothers, follow sisters,
Help prepare the Bride for Christ.",
"2": "When you follow, as you follow;
Take the blood, and call His name;
Much assurance He will give you,
And the enemy you'll shame.",
"3": "When they speak, as they are speaking,
Open wide your heart to them,
Thus the Word of God receiving,
Word of God, and not of men.",
"4": "Now the Word of God is running,
Running fast, and running free.
This is how the Lord is moving,
In His own recovery.",
"5": "O be glad, rejoice, dear brothers,
For the coming wedding day.
Then the Bride will be made ready-
Those who followed all the way."}
