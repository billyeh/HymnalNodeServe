["1 When I am in the natural man\nHow very strong I feel I am.\nI do not know, I cannot scan,\nHow weak I am.", "2 When in the world I have my life\nI cannot sense my failure rife\nBut boasting in my earnest strife\nI forward press.", "3 When I within the darkness dwell\nMy shallow state I cannot tell\nI only think how I excel\nAnd proudly dream.", "4 But when at last I come to Thee\nThy searching light uncovers me\nI see what I could never see-\nMy self exposed.", "5 I wither 'neath Thy piercing ray\nAnd all my strength dissolves away\nMy self-esteem in dust I lay\nAnd lowly bow.", "6 How blind and foolish is the pride,\nWith which my soul was fortified;\nFrom my dark heart, self-satisfied\nIt issued forth.", "7 There's not a thing that pride can claim\nThere's not a member but is lame\nThere's only deep regret and shame\nHow can I pray?", "8 Thy blood from judgment saveth me.\nThy life from wrath delivers me\nHow filthy yet in poverty,\nI really am.", "9 I want to pray, but faith have not\nI fain would seek Thee as Thou art.\nOh, canst Thou e'er renew my heart\nHave mercy, Lord!"]
