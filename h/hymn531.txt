["1 Fade, fade each earthly joy;\nJesus is mine.\nBreak every tender tie;\nJesus is mine.\nDark is the wilderness,\nEarth has no resting place,\nJesus alone can bless;\nJesus is mine.", "2 Tempt not my soul away;\nJesus is mine.\nHere would I ever stay;\nJesus is mine.\nPerishing things of clay,\nBorn but for one brief day,\nPass from my heart away;\nJesus is mine.", "3 Farewell, ye dreams of night;\nJesus is mine.\nLost in this dawning bright;\nJesus is mine.\nAll that my soul has tried\nLeft but a dismal void;\nJesus has satisfied;\nJesus is mine.", "4 Farewell, mortality;\nJesus is mine.\nWelcome, eternity;\nJesus is mine.\nWelcome, O Loved and Blest,\nWelcome, sweet scenes of rest,\nWelcome, my Savior's breast;\nJesus is mine."]
