{"1": "Guide me, O Thou gracious Savior,
Pilgrim through this barren land;
I am weak, but Thou art mighty,
Hold me with Thy pow'rful hand;
Bread of heaven,
Feed me till I want no more;
Bread of heaven,
Feed me till I want no more.",
"2": "Open now the crystal fountain,
Whence the healing waters flow;
Let the fiery, cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through;
Strong Deliv'rer,
Be Thou still my strength and shield;
Strong Deliv'rer,
Be Thou still my strength and shield."}
