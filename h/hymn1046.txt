["1 \"Almost persuaded\" now to believe;\n\"Almost persuaded\" Christ to receive;\nSeems now some soul to say,\n\"Go, Spirit, go Thy way,\nSome more convenient day\non Thee I'll call.\"", "2 \"Almost persuaded,\" come, come today;\n\"Almost persuaded,\" turn not away;\nJesus invites you here,\nAngels are ling'ring near,\nPrayers rise from hearts so dear;\nO wand'rer, come!", "3 Oh, be persuaded! Christ never fails-\nOh, be persuaded! His blood avails-\nCan save from every sin,\nCleanse you without, within-\nWill you not let Him in?\nOpen the door!", "4 \"Almost persuaded,\" harvest is past!\n\"Almost persuaded,\" doom comes at last;\n\"Almost\" cannot avail;\n\"Almost\" is but to fail!\nSad, sad that bitter wail-\n\"Almost-but lost!\"", "5 Be now persuaded, oh, sinner, hear!\nBe now persuaded, Jesus is near;\nHis voice is pleading still,\nTurn now with heart and will,\nPeace will your spirit fill-\nOh, turn today!"]
