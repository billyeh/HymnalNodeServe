["1 Crown Him with many crowns,\nThe Lamb upon His throne;\nHark! how the heav'nly anthem drowns\nAll music but its own!\nAwake, my soul, and sing\nOf Him who died for thee,\nAnd hail Him as thy matchless King\nThrough all eternity.", "2 Crown Him the Virgin's Son,\nThe God Incarnate born,\nWhose arm those crimson trophies won\nWhich now His brow adorn:\nFruit of the mystic Tree,\nAs of that Tree the Stem;\nThe Root whence flows Thy mercy free,\nThe Babe of Bethlehem.", "3 Crown Him the Lord of Love:\nBehold His hands and side;\nRich wounds yet visible above\nIn beauty glorified:\nNo angel in the sky\nCan fully bear that sight,\nBut downward bends his burning eye\nAt mysteries so bright.", "4 Crown Him the Lord of peace,\nWhose power a scepter sways\nFrom pole to pole, that wars may cease,\nAnd all be prayer and praise.\nHis reign shall know no end,\nAnd round His pierced feet\nFair flowers of glory now extend\nTheir fragrance ever sweet.", "5 Crown Him the Lord of years,\nThe Potentate of time.\nCreator of the rolling spheres,\nIneffable sublime.\nAll hail, Redeemer, hail!\nFor Thou hast died for me;\nThy praise shall never, never fail\nThroughout eternity."]
