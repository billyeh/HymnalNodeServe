{"1": "Standing in the evil day,
Heeding not what men may say,
Fearing not the face of clay,
Christian soldier, stand.",
"2": "Standing for the Word of God,
Standing for the precious blood,
Following where the saints have trod,
Christian soldier, stand.",
"3": "Stand 'mid Satan's every wile,
Stand 'mid pleasure's wanton smile,
Stand when error would beguile;
Christian soldier, stand.",
"4": "Stand till ends life's little day,
Stand for Jesus, come what may,
Stand and fight and watch and pray;
Christian soldier, stand."}
