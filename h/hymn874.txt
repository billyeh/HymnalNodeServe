["1 Standing in the evil day,\nHeeding not what men may say,\nFearing not the face of clay,\nChristian soldier, stand.", "2 Standing for the Word of God,\nStanding for the precious blood,\nFollowing where the saints have trod,\nChristian soldier, stand.", "3 Stand 'mid Satan's every wile,\nStand 'mid pleasure's wanton smile,\nStand when error would beguile;\nChristian soldier, stand.", "4 Stand till ends life's little day,\nStand for Jesus, come what may,\nStand and fight and watch and pray;\nChristian soldier, stand."]
