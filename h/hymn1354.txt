["1 When the Lord descends from heaven, and God's trumpet sound we hear,\nThose who sleep will rise, and death will swallowed be.\nWhen the Lord descends from heaven, raptured we will be who live,\nAnd our bodies be transformed in liberty.", "chorus When the Lord will come in glory\nWe will see His glorious body;\nWhen the Lord will come in glory,\nTo transfigure all His sons, we'll have a share.", "2 When the Lord descends from heaven, then the morning bright will dawn,\nThis dark night will pass, and weeping will be o'er.\nWhen the Lord descends from heaven, days of glory will begin;\nSighing and corruption gone forevermore.", "3 E'er the Lord will come from heaven, the bright morning star will shine,\nThose who watch escape the trial, gain the prize.\nThen the Lord will come and as the Sun of righteousness will reign;\nEarth will be restored, God's mercy realize.", "4 Soon the Lord will come from heaven; may we watch and wait with prayer,\nLoins be girt about, and lamps be burning bright.\nSoon the Lord will come from heaven, may we serve Him faithfully,\nThus the ministry fulfill, our gifts incite."]
