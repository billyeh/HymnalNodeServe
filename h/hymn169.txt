His chosen, His delight;
With oil of joy, anointed
How comely in His sight.",
"chorus": "We treasure with affection,
Thy perfect comeliness
Thy sweetness and Thy fragrance
And all Thy loveliness.",

The fairest of the fair
Thy mouth with grace o'erfloweth;
Our hearts their love declare.",

And honored Thee at birth;
Thou wast by noble buried
Still lovable in death.",

The lovely One Thou art;
Thy feet anointed also
Beloved in every part.",

Man's spirit comforteth;
Thy resurrection fragrance,
God's longing answereth.",
"6": "As henna flow'rs, Thy beauty,
In loveliness complete;
As apple trees that flourish
Thy fruit abundant, sweet.",

Thy name an ointment is;
We take Thee as our love feast,
And taste the sweetest bliss.",
"8": "As on Thyself we ponder,
And all Thy beauty trace
We taste to full Thy sweetness,
And rest in Thine embrace."}
