{"1": "O God, th' eternal Father, Thou
The uncreated, great I AM!
More ancient than the ancients are
Before the primal age began!",
"2": "From everlasting Thou art God
All time and space Thou dost transcend!
The fulness of eternity
Without beginning, without end!",
"3": "Th' eternal source of all Thou art
Before the heavens were decreed!
Thou art the first of all the first
And e'en the foremost dost precede!",
"4": "Thou art the life that ever lasts
From age to age Thou endest not!
More lasting than all that which lasts
Beyond the ultimate Thou art!",
"5": "Thou art the Alpha as the first
Omega, as the last Thou art!
From start to end Thou hast no lack
Complete and perfect, wanting not!",
"6": "We praise Thee for Thine endless years
Extol Thee for Thy boundlessness!
We praise Thee for Thy fulness vast
Extol Thee for Thy Perfectness!"}
