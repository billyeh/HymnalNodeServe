["1 I have learned the wondrous secret\nOf abiding in the Lord;\nI have tasted life's pure fountain,\nI am drinking of His word;\nI have found the strength and sweetness\nOf abiding 'neath the blood;\nI have lost myself in Jesus,\nI am sinking into God.", "chorus I'm abiding in the Lord\nAnd confiding in His word;\nI am hiding in the bosom of His love.\nYes, abiding in the Lord\nAnd confiding in His word,\nI am hiding in the bosom of His love.", "2 I am crucified with Jesus,\nAnd He lives and dwells with me;\nI have ceased from all my struggling,\n'Tis no longer I, but He.\nAll my will is yielding to Him,\nAnd His Spirit reigns within;\nAnd His precious blood each moment\nKeeps me cleansed and free from sin.", "3 All my sicknesses I bring Him,\nAnd He bears them all away;\nAll my fears and griefs I tell Him,\nAll my cares from day to day,\nAll my strength I draw from Jesus,\nBy His breath I live and move;\nE'en His very mind He gives me,\nAnd His faith, and life, and love.", "4 For my words I take His wisdom,\nFor my works His Spirit's power;\nFor my ways His ceaseless presence\nGuards and guides me every hour.\nOf my heart, He is the portion,\nOf my joy the boundless spring;\nSavior, Sanctifier, Healer,\nGlorious Lord, and coming King."]
