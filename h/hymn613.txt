{"1": "I would commune with Thee, my God;
E'en to Thy seat I come;
I leave my joys, I leave my sins,
And seek in Thee my home.",
"2": "I stand upon the mount of God,
With sunlight in my soul;
I see the storms in vales beneath,
I hear the thunder's roll.",
"3": "But I am calm with Thee, my God,
Beneath these glorious skies;
And to the height on which I stand
Nor storms nor clouds can rise.",
"4": "Oh, this is life! oh, this is joy,
My God, to find Thee so;
Thy face to see, Thy voice to hear,
And all Thy love to know.
note: "(Repeat the last line of each stanza)"}
