["1 Christ calling yet! shall I not hear?\nEarth's pleasures shall I still hold dear?\nShall life's swift passing years all fly,\nAnd still my soul in slumber lie?", "chorus Calling yet, oh, hear Him!\nCalling yet, oh, hear Him!\nChrist is calling yet;\nOh! hear Him calling, calling!\nCalling yet, oh, hear Him!\nCalling yet, oh, hear Him!\nChrist is calling yet; oh, hear\nHim calling yet!", "2 Christ calling yet! shall I not rise?\nCan I His loving voice despise,\nAnd basely His kind care repay?\nHe calls me still; can I delay?", "3 Christ calling yet! and shall He knock,\nAnd I my heart the closer lock?\nHe still is waiting to receive;\nAnd shall I dare His Spirit grieve?", "4 Christ calling yet! and shall I give\nNo heed, but still in bondage live?\nI wait, but He does not forsake:\nHe calls me still; my heart, awake!", "5 Christ calling yet! I cannot stay;\nMy heart I yield without delay;\nVain world, farewell! from thee I part;\nThe voice of Christ has reached my heart."]
