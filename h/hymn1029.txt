{"1": "Christ calling yet! shall I not hear?
Earth's pleasures shall I still hold dear?
Shall life's swift passing years all fly,
And still my soul in slumber lie?",
"chorus": "Calling yet, oh, hear Him!
Calling yet, oh, hear Him!
Christ is calling yet;
Oh! hear Him calling, calling!
Calling yet, oh, hear Him!
Calling yet, oh, hear Him!
Christ is calling yet; oh, hear
Him calling yet!",
"2": "Christ calling yet! shall I not rise?
Can I His loving voice despise,
And basely His kind care repay?
He calls me still; can I delay?",
"3": "Christ calling yet! and shall He knock,
And I my heart the closer lock?
He still is waiting to receive;
And shall I dare His Spirit grieve?",
"4": "Christ calling yet! and shall I give
No heed, but still in bondage live?
I wait, but He does not forsake:
He calls me still; my heart, awake!",
"5": "Christ calling yet! I cannot stay;
My heart I yield without delay;
Vain world, farewell! from thee I part;
The voice of Christ has reached my heart."}
