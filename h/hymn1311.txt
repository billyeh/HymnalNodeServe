["1 The local churches are preparing for the Lord's return-\nWe know the time is near for our Bridegroom so dear.\nHe's coming back to claim the Bride for which His heart doth yearn,\nThat with Him we may be through all eternity.", "chorus The Christ we love is coming soon,\nAnd He will come as our Bridegroom.\nWe'll wait for Him, we'll watch and pray-\nIt may be today, it may be today!", "2 How we must give Him all our heart and from all idols turn!\nOh, who else could there be who loves so tenderly?\nLord Jesus, You're the only One who makes our heart to burn-\nO please do not delay! Come quickly, e'en today!", "3 A glorious Bride He is preparing for His wedding day;\nShe'll be so bright and pure, fine linen covering her.\nO Lord, work in Thy righteousness, this is the only way;\nAnd blessed we will be to join that feast with Thee."]
