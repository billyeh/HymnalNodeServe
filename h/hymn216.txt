{"1": "Around Thy table, holy Lord,
In fellowship we meet,
Obedient to Thy gracious word,
This feast of love to eat.",
"2": "Here every one that loves Thy name,
Our willing hearts embrace;
Our source of life and hope the same,
All debtors to Thy grace.",
"3": "Commune with each at this blest hour,
Thy peace, Thy joy impart;
Thy thoughts of love, of truth, of pow'r,
Impress upon each heart."}
