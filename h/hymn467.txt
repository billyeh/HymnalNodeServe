["1 This day the Lord has spoken,\nThis day my choice is made:\nI will be all for Jesus,\nWho all for me has paid.", "2 Now His shall be the empire,\nIn all things over me;\nAnd I will be His bond slave,\nYet gloriously free.", "3 From henceforth, owning nothing,\nI cannot lose at all;\nI cannot well be poorer,\nWhatever may befall.", "4 Yet could I not be richer,\nIf I the world should gain;\nFor heav'n and earth shall perish,\nBut Jesus will remain.", "5 And He will be my treasure,\nAnd He my boundless store;\nAnd those who live on Jesus,\nWill never hunger more.", "6 Though I am utter weakness,\nIn Him I shall prevail;\nAnd though my love may falter,\nYet His will never fail."]
