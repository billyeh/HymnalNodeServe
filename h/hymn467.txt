{"1": "This day the Lord has spoken,
This day my choice is made:
I will be all for Jesus,
Who all for me has paid.",
"2": "Now His shall be the empire,
In all things over me;
And I will be His bond slave,
Yet gloriously free.",
"3": "From henceforth, owning nothing,
I cannot lose at all;
I cannot well be poorer,
Whatever may befall.",
"4": "Yet could I not be richer,
If I the world should gain;
For heav'n and earth shall perish,
But Jesus will remain.",
"5": "And He will be my treasure,
And He my boundless store;
And those who live on Jesus,
Will never hunger more.",
"6": "Though I am utter weakness,
In Him I shall prevail;
And though my love may falter,
Yet His will never fail."}
