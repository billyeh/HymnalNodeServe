["1 What a blessing, what a priv'lege!\nCalled of God a royal priest\nThat this glorious, holy office,\nI should bear, though last and least.", "chorus All the building of the Body,\nOn the priesthood doth depend;\nEver praying in the spirit,\nI this office would attend.", "2 If I keep this royal calling,\nUnder Thine authority\nPriestly duty thus fulfilling\nThen the church will builded be.", "3 Now the church is but the priesthood;\nThus the priesthood formed we need;\nWhen the priests are knit together\nThen the church is built indeed.", "4 Through the church's degradation\nSaints this office desolate;\nThrough the weakness of their spirits,\nPreaching doth predominate.", "5 Most are leaning on the message,\nAnd the preaching emphasize\nYet neglect the priestly praying,\nAnd their spirits' exercise.", "6 Deal with me and make me balanced\nAs in preaching, so in prayer;\nLeading others oft in praying\nAs Thy Word I too declare.", "7 Only serving by our praying,\nWill our spirits mingled be;\nStressing prayer as much as preaching-\nThus the church is built for Thee."]
