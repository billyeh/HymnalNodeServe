{"1": "What a blessing, what a priv'lege!
Called of God a royal priest
That this glorious, holy office,
I should bear, though last and least.",
"chorus": "All the building of the Body,
On the priesthood doth depend;
Ever praying in the spirit,
I this office would attend.",
"2": "If I keep this royal calling,
Under Thine authority
Priestly duty thus fulfilling
Then the church will builded be.",
"3": "Now the church is but the priesthood;
Thus the priesthood formed we need;
When the priests are knit together
Then the church is built indeed.",
"4": "Through the church's degradation
Saints this office desolate;
Through the weakness of their spirits,
Preaching doth predominate.",
"5": "Most are leaning on the message,
And the preaching emphasize
Yet neglect the priestly praying,
And their spirits' exercise.",
"6": "Deal with me and make me balanced
As in preaching, so in prayer;
Leading others oft in praying
As Thy Word I too declare.",
"7": "Only serving by our praying,
Will our spirits mingled be;
Stressing prayer as much as preaching-
Thus the church is built for Thee."}
