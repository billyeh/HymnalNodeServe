["1 Splendid church life! His green garden!\nHe has brought us, praise the Lord,\nTo experience the Christ Who's growing here!\nHe is full of rich enjoyment\nTo His saints in one accord;\nHe is new and fresh, available and dear.", "chorus I'm so happy in this lovely place,\nIn the garden growing in His grace!\nThere is no finer pleasure\nThan to eat the living tree\nAnd to get the living water into me.", "2 It is not a school or fact'ry\nOr a chapel in the air;\nBut a garden where our Lord can plant and sow.\nSo He's placed us all here corporately\nTo be His garden fair,\nWhere He's free to cultivate and make us grow.", "3 Thus within the church-life garden\nThere's a fruit-producing tree\nFull of life and so available to eat.\nSo be simple, don't be hardened,\nDrop your concepts-eat that tree!\nTake in Jesus every moment-He's so sweet!", "4 With the tree there is the water,\nFlowing God in Christ to us,\nQuenching all our dryness, ending all our strife.\nHallelujah! In His garden\nJesus flows Himself to us,\nAs the full supply for us to grow in life.", "5 Aren't you satisfied and thankful\nThat our Lord has brought you in\nWhere His pleasures and His riches flow so free?\nSo be happy and be joyful,\nIn the spirit feast on Him,\nSo God's garden can bear fruit abundantly."]
