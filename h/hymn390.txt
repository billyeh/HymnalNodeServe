{"1": "Savior, lead me, this I pray
In the Spirit all the day;
Walking in the light of life
I would cease from all my strife.",
"chorus": "Lead me, lead me
Savior, lead me, this I pray;
Deeply in the stream of life
Lead me, Savior, in Thy way.",
"2": "Thou as life in me indeed
By the law of life dost lead;
When Thou reignest in Thy might
All my darkness turns to light.",
"3": "Liberating Spirit, Thou
Wholly regulate me now;
Thus my mind Thou wilt renew,
And Thy will I'll fully know."}
