["1 Now the Lord our souls has fed,\nWith Himself, the Living Bread;\nFed us, sitting at His feet,\nWith the finest of the wheat.", "2 We have endless treasure found;\nWe have all things and abound;\nRich abundance and to spare;\nShall we not the blessing share?", "3 For, while we are feasting here,\nStarving millions, far and near,\nCall us with the bitter cry:\nCome and help us, or we die.", "4 In this day of full increase,\nShall we, can we, hold our peace?\nStaying here we do not well;\nNow then, let us go and tell:", "5 Tell how He hath set us free,\nHow He leads triumphantly;\nHow He satisfies our need;\nHow His rest is rest indeed.", "6 Speak, for we, Thy servants, hear;\nThou hast taught us not to fear;\nAnd whate'er Thy word shall be,\nWe can do it, Lord, in Thee."]
