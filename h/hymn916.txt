{"1": "Now the Lord our souls has fed,
With Himself, the Living Bread;
Fed us, sitting at His feet,
With the finest of the wheat.",
"2": "We have endless treasure found;
We have all things and abound;
Rich abundance and to spare;
Shall we not the blessing share?",
"3": "For, while we are feasting here,
Starving millions, far and near,
Call us with the bitter cry:
Come and help us, or we die.",
"4": "In this day of full increase,
Shall we, can we, hold our peace?
Staying here we do not well;
Now then, let us go and tell:",
"5": "Tell how He hath set us free,
How He leads triumphantly;
How He satisfies our need;
How His rest is rest indeed.",
"6": "Speak, for we, Thy servants, hear;
Thou hast taught us not to fear;
And whate'er Thy word shall be,
We can do it, Lord, in Thee."}
