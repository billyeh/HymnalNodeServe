{"1": "God created us His vessels,
His expression to achieve;
Thus He made a heart to love Him,
And a spirit to receive.",
"2": "With our heart we have to love Him
With our spirit Him possess,
As our life, of Him partaking
That Himself we may express.",
"3": "Satan has our heart corrupted
To our spirit death did give
That the Lord we should not contact,
But by self attempt to live.",
"4": "Thus the Lord in His salvation,
Heart and spirit has renewed,
To recover our receiving,
And our loving aptitude.",
"5": "It is by our heart's renewal,
We may God in love pursue
And in newness of the spirit,
We may contact God anew.",
"6": "Ever true and pure and single,
To the Lord our heart must be
Poor in spirit, ever seeking,
God to contact constantly.",
"7": "Keep our heart, Lord, in love's freshness
And our spirit strengthen more
That in newness of the spirit,
We may touch Thee o'er and o'er."}
