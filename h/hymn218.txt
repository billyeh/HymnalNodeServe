{"1": "As gathered in Thy precious name,
This table we surround,
Thy death, Lord Jesus, to proclaim,
O may our praise abound.",
"2": "We give what from Thee we receive,
For all we have is Thine-
O may each heart with joy believe,
And echo "Thine is mine!"",
"3": "Grace, grace it was that brought Thee dow
Love shone in all Thy ways;
Through death Thine is the Victor's crown
And Thine the endless praise.",
"4": "We, here, in silence, or in song,
Together worship Thee;
Before our God we shall ere long
Give praise eternally.",
"5": "Lord Jesus Christ, Thou comest soon-
Today Thy death we show;
In light, eclipsing sun at noon,
Its myst'ry we shall know."}
