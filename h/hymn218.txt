["1 As gathered in Thy precious name,\nThis table we surround,\nThy death, Lord Jesus, to proclaim,\nO may our praise abound.", "2 We give what from Thee we receive,\nFor all we have is Thine-\nO may each heart with joy believe,\nAnd echo \"Thine is mine!\"", "3 Grace, grace it was that brought Thee dow\nLove shone in all Thy ways;\nThrough death Thine is the Victor's crown\nAnd Thine the endless praise.", "4 We, here, in silence, or in song,\nTogether worship Thee;\nBefore our God we shall ere long\nGive praise eternally.", "5 Lord Jesus Christ, Thou comest soon-\nToday Thy death we show;\nIn light, eclipsing sun at noon,\nIts myst'ry we shall know."]
