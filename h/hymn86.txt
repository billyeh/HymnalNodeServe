{"1": "Though Thou art God, most glorious, high
Thou in the flesh to us came nigh
A lowly man become thereby;
Lord, I remember Thee!",
"2": "Glory divine was put away,
Under the tent of flesh to stay
No outward beauty to display;
Lord, I remember Thee!",
"3": "Thou art a root from out dry ground
Thou wast the Man of sorrows found
Hated, despised by man around;
Lord, I remember Thee!",
"4": "Gentle and lowly is Thy heart
Willing to suffer all Thou art
To God and man complaining not;
Lord, I remember Thee!",
"5": "Thou as a man art tender, sweet
Balanced in every way, complete
Meal-offering to the Father meet;
Lord, I remember Thee!",
"6": "Doing the Father's will Thy prize
Never accepting Satan's lies
None like Thyself, so faithful, wise;
Lord, I remember Thee!",
"7": "For Thine obedience to God's will
Willing to suffer deathly ill
E'en on the Cross my place to fill
Lord, I remember Thee!",
"8": "Therefore hath God exalted Thee
Given Thee glory, majesty
Heaven and earth will bow the knee;
O Lord, I worship Thee!"}
