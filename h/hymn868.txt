["1 Ere from our gathering we're dismissed, dear Lord\nWe sing again to thank Thee from our heart\nFor Thy dear presence and refreshing grace\nWhich Thou so richly didst to us impart.", "2 Though now the meeting's over, in Thy grace\nThy presence never will from us depart;\nBut as the Spirit Thy sustaining strength,\nThou wouldst in love unceasingly impart.", "3 Lord, may Thy presence go with us, we pray\nTo bear with us the burden on our heart,\nThat every moment we Thyself enjoy\nTill in the coming meeting we take part."]
