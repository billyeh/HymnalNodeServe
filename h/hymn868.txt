{"1": "Ere from our gathering we're dismissed, dear Lord
We sing again to thank Thee from our heart
For Thy dear presence and refreshing grace
Which Thou so richly didst to us impart.",
"2": "Though now the meeting's over, in Thy grace
Thy presence never will from us depart;
But as the Spirit Thy sustaining strength,
Thou wouldst in love unceasingly impart.",
"3": "Lord, may Thy presence go with us, we pray
To bear with us the burden on our heart,
That every moment we Thyself enjoy
Till in the coming meeting we take part."}
