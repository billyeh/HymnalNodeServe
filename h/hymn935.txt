["1 Around Thy grave, Lord Jesus,\nIn spirit here we stand,\nWith hearts all full of praises,\nTo keep Thy blest command:\nOur souls by faith rejoicing,\nTo trace Thy path of love,\nDown through death's angry billows,\nUp to the throne above.", "2 Lord Jesus! we remember\nThe travail of Thy soul,\nWhen through Thy love's deep pity,\nThe waves did o'er Thee roll;\nBaptized in death's dark waters,\nFor us Thy blood was shed;\nFor us Thou, Lord of Glory,\nWast numbered with the dead.", "3 O Lord! Thou now art risen,\nThy travail all is o'er;\nFor sin Thou once hast suffered,\nThou liv'st to die no more;\nSin, death and hell are vanquished\nBy Thee, the Church's Head;\nAnd lo! we share Thy triumphs,\nThou first-born from the dead.", "4 Unto Thy death baptized,\nWe own with Thee we died;\nWith Thee, our Life, we're risen,\nAnd shall be glorified.\nFrom sin, the world, and Satan,\nWe're ransomed by Thy blood,\nAnd here would walk as strangers,\nAlive with Thee to God."]
