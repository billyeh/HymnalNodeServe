{"1": "Christ is the one reality of all
Of Godhead and of man and all things else;
No man without Him ever findeth God
Without Him man and everything is false.",
"2": "All types and figures of the ancient time
All things we ever need, both great and small
Only are shadows of the Christ of God
Showing that He must be our all in all.",
"3": "All things are vanity of vanities
Christ, the reality all things to fill;
Though everything we may enjoy and own
If we're devoid of Christ we're empty still.",
"4": "Christ is our real God, our real Lord
Christ is our real life, our real light;
Christ is our real food, our real drink
Our real clothing, and our real might.",
"5": "Christ also is the one reality,
Of all our doctrine and theology;
And all our scriptural knowledge without Him,
Is just in letter and is vanity.",
"6": "Christ, the reality of time and space
Christ, the reality of every stage;
Christ is the one reality of all,
Thru all eternity from age to age."}
