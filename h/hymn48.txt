["1 We bless Thee, God and Father,\nWe joy before Thy face;\nBeyond dark death for ever,\nWe share Thy Son's blest place.\nHe lives a Man before Thee,\nIn cloudless light above,\nIn Thine unbounded favor,\nThine everlasting love.", "2 His Father and our Father,\nHis God and ours Thou art;\nAnd He is Thy Beloved,\nThe gladness of Thy heart.\nWe're His, in joy He brings us\nTo share His part and place,\nTo know Thy love and favor,\nThe shining of Thy face.", "3 Thy love that now enfolds us\nCan ne'er wax cold or dim;\nIn Him that love doth center,\nAnd we are loved in Him.\nIn Him Thy love and glory\nFind their eternal rest;\nThe many sons-His brethren-\nIn Him, how near, how blest!"]
