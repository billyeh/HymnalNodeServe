{"1": "How good is the Lord we adore,
Our faithful, unchangeable Friend;
His love is as great as His pow'r
And knows neither measure nor end.",
"2": "'Tis Jesus the first and the last,
Who shall guide us through all to the throne;
We'll praise Him for all that is past,
We'll trust Him for all that's to come."}
