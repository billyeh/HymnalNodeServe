{"1": "Praise God for tidings glad-
We're at the throne of grace;
Our gospel's not so low,
We're in the highest place.
We're meeting here around the throne,
Enjoying God with all His own.",
"2": "Start in the outer court,
But aim to get inside;
The Holy Place is good,
But do not there abide.
Leave sin behind-it's put away;
We're in the veil with God to stay.",
"3": "To rise from earth to heav'n,
A deeper turn we need;
To be where Christ is now
Upon the throne indeed.
We're gathered at the throne of grace,
Beholding Jesus face to face.",
"4": "We're being turned as one,
Not individually;
Not private Christians now,
But Body Christians we.
As members here in one accord,
We are the Body of the Lord.",
"5": "As Body Christians now
We have a higher word.
Foundation's word we see,
'Tis altar, cross, and blood.
Perfection's word is little known,
'Tis fellowship around the throne.",
"6": "Christ is objective too,
But subjective are we
In our experience;
Our spirit is the key.
God, throne, and holiest-we see
Our spirit now contains all three.",
"7": "Leviticus is past,
And Aaron's work is o'er;
Melchisedec is here,
High Priest forevermore;
His ministry is now so fine:
He comes to feed us bread and wine.
