{"1": "God intends that all His being,
Be my full supply;
With Him I must be united
In spirit nigh.",
"chorus": "All God's being, all His riches,
In the Spirit flow;
I must exercise my spirit,
Him to know.",
"2": "All the riches of His nature,
He has given me;
I must touch Him in the spirit
These to see.",
"3": "With the mind we understand Him
With the spirit touch;
Those who never use the spirit,
Lack very much.",
"4": "When to messages I listen
I must pray them in;
Thus the word will be digested,
From within.",
"5": "When the Word of God I study
I must touch the Lord;
If in mind and not in spirit
Dead is the Word.",
"6": "O what riches, O what glory,
In the Spirit shine!
When I exercise my spirit
All are mine."}
