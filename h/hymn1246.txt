{"1": "We give ourselves to follow the churches,
Oneness in Christ display;
Follow His move in all of the churches,
Stand fast as one this way.",
"chorus": "We must follow the Spirit
In all simplicity.
In our spirit is Jesus-
He follows perfectly!",
"2": "We give ourselves to follow the followers,
By this we truly learn;
Never desiring to be the leaders,
But to the Spirit turn.",
"3": "We give ourselves the flock's steps to follow
Knowing the Shepherd's care.
Now in the churches Jesus is leading
And He is speaking there.",
"4": "We give ourselves to Thee, O Lord Jesus,
Never to turn aside;
Where'er the Lamb goes, there we would follow,
Follow whate'er betide.",
"5": "We give ourselves to enter the kingdom,
That marriage feast, with Him;
Come persecution, suffering, and trials,
Still we will enter in.",
"6": "Christ wants some followers here in the churches,
Followers of whom to say:
"These saw My purpose, followed Me wholly"-
May we be those today!"}
