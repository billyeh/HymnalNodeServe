{"1": "Breathe on us, Lord of life,
Fill us with life anew,
That we may love what Thou dost love,
And do what Thou wouldst do.",
"2": "Breathe on us, Lord of life.
Until our hearts are pure,
Until with Thee we will one will,
To do or to endure.",
"3": "Breathe on us, Lord of life,
Till we are wholly Thine,
Till all this earthly part of us
Glows with Thy fire divine.",
"4": "Breathe on us, Lord of life,
So shall we never die,
But live with Thee the perfect life
Of Thine eternity."}
