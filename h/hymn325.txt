["1 All my life long I had panted\nFor a draught from some cool spring,\nThat I hoped would quench the burning\nOf the thirst I felt within.", "chorus Hallelujah! I have found Him\nWhom my soul so long has craved!\nJesus satisfies my longings;\nThrough His life I now am saved.", "2 Feeding on the husks around me,\nTill my strength was almost gone,\nLonged my soul for something better,\nOnly still to hunger on.", "3 Poor I was, and sought for riches,\nSomething that would satisfy,\nBut the dust I gathered round me\nOnly mocked my soul's sad cry.", "4 Well of water, ever springing,\nBread of life, so rich and free,\nUntold wealth that never faileth,\nMy Redeemer is to me."]
