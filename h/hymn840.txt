{"1": "Freed from self and Adam's nature
Lord, I would be built by Thee,
With the saints into Thy temple
Where Thy glory we shall see.
From peculiar traits deliver
From my independent ways
That a dwelling place for Thee, Lord
We will be thru all our days.",
"2": "By Thy life and by its flowing,
I can grow and be transformed
With the saints coordinated
Builded up, to Thee conformed;
Keep the order in the Body
There to function in Thy will
Ever serving, helping others
All Thy purpose to fulfill.",
"3": "In my knowledge and experience,
I would not exalted be
But submitting and accepting,
Let the Body balance me;
Holding fast the Head, and growing,
With His increase, in His way
By the joints and bands supplying
Knit together day by day.",
"4": "By Thy Spirit daily strengthened,
In the inner man with might
I would know Thy love surpassing
Know Thy breadth and length and height;
Ever of Thy riches taking
Unto all Thy fulness filled
Ever growing into manhood
That Thy Body Thou may build.",
"5": "In God's house and in Thy Body,
Builded up I long to be
That within this corporate vessel,
All shall then Thy glory see;
That Thy Bride, the glorious city
May appear upon the earth
As a lampstand brightly beaming,
To express to all Thy worth."}
