{"1": "Take the name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe;
It will joy and comfort give you,
Take it then where'er you go.",
"chorus": "Precious name! Oh, how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heav'n;
Precious name! Oh, how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heav'n.",
"2": "Take the name of Jesus ever,
As a shield from every snare.
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.",
"3": "Oh, the precious name of Jesus,
How it thrills our souls with joy;
All the favor of the Father
In this name we may enjoy.",
"4": "At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
Claim His vict'ry over evil
And the enemy defeat."}
