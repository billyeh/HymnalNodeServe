["1 Take the name of Jesus with you,\nChild of sorrow and of woe;\nIt will joy and comfort give you,\nTake it then where'er you go.", "chorus Precious name! Oh, how sweet!\nHope of earth and joy of heav'n;\nPrecious name! Oh, how sweet!\nHope of earth and joy of heav'n.", "2 Take the name of Jesus ever,\nAs a shield from every snare.\nIf temptations round you gather,\nBreathe that holy name in prayer.", "3 Oh, the precious name of Jesus,\nHow it thrills our souls with joy;\nAll the favor of the Father\nIn this name we may enjoy.", "4 At the name of Jesus bowing,\nFalling prostrate at His feet,\nClaim His vict'ry over evil\nAnd the enemy defeat."]
