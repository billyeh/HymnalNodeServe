{"1": "Christ delivered me when bound,
And when bleeding, healed my wound;
Sought me wand'ring, set me right,
Turned my darkness into light.",
"2": "Can a woman's tender care
Cease towards the child she bare?
Yes, she may forgetful be;
Yet will He remember me.",
"3": "His is an unchanging love,
Higher than the heights above;
Deeper than the depths beneath,
Free and faithful, strong as death.",
"4": "I shall see His glory soon,
When the work of grace is done;
Partner of His throne shall be;
Such is His great love for me!",
"5": "Lord, it is my chief complaint
That my love is weak and faint;
Yet I love Thee, and adore:
Oh for grace to love Thee more."}
