["1 Lord, Thy word of old to David\nWe have heard and hear it now:\n\"On Thy throne will sit forever\nThine own seed-this is My vow.\"\nThis has been fulfilled in Jesus\nSeated on the throne on high,\nSitting on the throne of David\nResurrected, ne'er to die.", "2 Then another promise followed\nDavid's seed upon the throne:\n\"I'll rebuild His tabernacle\nAnd by this I will be known.\"\nLord, we thank Thee, Thou art faithful\nTo perform Thy promised word.\nDavid's tabernacle, ruined,\nSoon by Thee will be restored.", "3 Lord, we are that tabernacle,\nThy rebuilding work on earth;\nLord, restore Thyself a dwelling\nWhere is seen Thy boundless worth.\nThus shall all of mankind seek Thee.\nAnd the Gentiles call Thy name.\nFrom Thy holy tabernacle\nAll the earth shall know Thy fame.", "4 Hasten, Lord, Thy work upon us\nTo restore and build us now.\nFor this work we give ourselves, Lord;\nHere to Thee we make a vow:\n\"Though our strength is weak and feeble,\nYet our hearts would ever be\nFrom this day, Lord, for Thy building,\nNow and for eternity."]
