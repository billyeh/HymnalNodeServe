{"1": "Lord, Thou art the "Seed of woman,
Born to bruise the enemy;
Thou didst take the human nature
Die to win the victory.
As the very God incarnate
Flesh and blood Thou didst partake;
Thou thru death hast crushed the devil,
And his pow'r of death didst break.",
"2": ""Seed of Abraham, Thou art, Lord
By God's promise Thou hast come
That the blessing He hath promised,
On all people thus might come.
Abraham Thou hast preceded
For Thou art the great "I AM,
Yet Thou cam'st to be his offspring,
And become God's promised "Lamb.",
"3": "Lord, Thou art the "Seed of David,
For the kingdom Thou wast raised;
For God's glory and His building,
On the throne Thou hast been placed.
Truly Thou art "David's offspring,
Yet "my Lord" he calleth Thee
For Thou art his "root" and fountain
"Lord of all" eternally.",
"4": "Though "a child" born with our nature
Thou the "Mighty God" art called;
Thou, "a son" to us art given
"Everlasting Father" called.
All the blessings God hath promised
With our faith on Thee depend;
Thou art "Yea" and "Amen" for them
All the content and the end!"}
