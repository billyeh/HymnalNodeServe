["1 Oh, to be nothing, nothing!\nOnly to lie at His feet,\nA broken and emptied vessel-\nFor the Master's use made meet!\nEmptied that He might fill me\nAs forth to His service I go;\nBroken, that so unhindered,\nHis life through me might flow.", "chorus Oh, to be nothing, nothing!\nOnly to lie at His feet,\nA broken and emptied vessel-\nFor the Master's use made meet!", "2 Oh, to be nothing, nothing!\nOnly as led by His hand-\nA messenger at His gateway,\nOnly waiting for His command;\nOnly an instrument ready\nHis praises to sound at His will-\nWilling, should He not require me,\nIn silence to wait on Him still.", "3 Oh, to be nothing, nothing!\nPainful the humbling may be!\nYet low in the dust I'd lay me\nThat the world might my Savior see!\nRather be nothing, nothing!\nTo Him let their voices be raised!\nHe is the fountain of blessing,\nHe only is meet to be praised!"]
