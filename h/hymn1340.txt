["1 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water\nOut of the wells of salvation.\nAnd in that day shall ye say,\nPraise the Lord.\n(Repeat the above four lines)", "chorus Call upon His name,\nDeclare His doings among the people,\nMake mention that His name is exalted.\nCry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion:\nFor great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee."]
