I am not my own;
All I have and all I am
Shall be His alone.",

He is Lord and King,
Reigning in my inmost heart
Over everything.",

What can hurt or harm,
When He folds around my soul
His almighty Arm?",
"4": "I belong to Jesus;
Blessed, blessed thought!
With His own most precious blood
Has my soul been bought.",
"5": "I belong to Jesus;
He has died for me;
I am His and He is mine
Through eternity.",

He will keep my soul,
If the deathly waters dark
Round about me roll.",
"7": "I belong to Jesus;
And ere long I'll be
With my precious Savior there
In His royalty."}
