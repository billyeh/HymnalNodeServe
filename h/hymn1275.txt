["1 Glorious things to thee are spoken,\nPhiladelphia, church of love.\nThese things saith the One who's holy,\nHe who's real speaks from above;\nHe that has the key of David,\nWho the kingdom's entrance won,\n\"I will open, no man shutteth\"-\nHe has spoken; it is done.", "2 Hallelujah, Philadelphia,\nThine are works that please the Lord.\nStrength thou hast, though just a little\nAnd hast kept His living Word.\nThou His holy name denied not,\nBut confessed it here below-\nLo, a door is set before thee,\nThrough which none but thee can go.", "3 Thou, beloved Philadelphia,\nDost His Word of patience keep.\nFrom the hour of trial He'll save thee,\nWhich o'er all the world shall sweep.\nTroublers too shall know He loves thee;\nThey to thee must then bow down.\n\"Hold thou fast, for I come quickly,\nThat no man may take thy crown.\"", "4 Hallelujah, overcomers,\n\"In the temple of My God,\nI will build them in as pillars,\nNevermore to go abroad.\"\nGod's own name is written on them\nAnd the new name of the Lord.\nWith the triune God they're blended;\nThey're the city of our God.", "5 Hallelujah, out of heaven,\nComes the New Jerusalem:\nGates of pearl and walls of jasper,\nMingled with each precious gem.\nPhiladelphia, Philadelphia,\nHas become His Bride so dear.\nNow the Spirit in the churches\nSpeaks to all who have an ear."]
