["1 Lord, accept our feeble song!\nPow'r and praise to Thee belong;\nWe would all Thy grace record,\nHoly, gracious, loving Lord!", "2 Rich in glory, Thou didst stoop,\nThence is all Thy people's hope;\nThou wast poor, that we might be\nRich in glory, Lord, with Thee.", "3 Wherefore Thou high heaven didst spurn?\nWherefore Thou to earth didst turn?\nWhy leave heav'n to come to earth\nLonely, scorned, e'en suffering death?", "4 Thou in heav'n-the glorious One!\nThou on earth-the outcast Man!\nThough this suffering Thou didst know,\nLove would come to bear our woe.", "5 When we think of love like this,\nJoy and shame our hearts possess;\nJoy, that Thou couldst pity thus;\nShame, for such returns from us.", "6 Yet we hope the day to see\nWhen from every hindrance free,\nWhen to Thee, in glory, brought,\nWe shall serve Thee as we ought.", "7 Now, O Lord, we wait for Thee,\nWait \"the blessed hope\" to see.\nMay we ever for Thee live,\nTill Thy saints Thou dost receive."]
