["1 Crucified with Christ my Savior,\nTo the world and self and sin;\nTo the death-born life of Jesus\nI am sweetly ent'ring in:\nIn His fellowship of suff'ring,\nTo His death conformed to be,\nI am going with my Savior\nAll the way to Calvary.", "chorus All the way to Calvary,\nWhere my Savior went for me,\nHelp me, Lord, to go with Thee,\nAll the way to Calvary.", "2 'Tis not hard to die with Christ\nWhen His risen life we know;\n'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings\nWhen our hearts with joy o'erflow.\nIn His resurrection power\nHe has come to dwell in me,\nAnd my heart is gladly going\nAll the way to Calvary.", "3 If we die we'll live with Christ,\nIf we suffer we shall reign;\nOnly thus the prize of glory\nCan the conqueror attain.\nOh, how sweet, on that glad morning\nShould the Master say to thee,\n\"Yes, my child, thou didst go with me\nAll the way to Calvary.\""]
