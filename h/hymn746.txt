{"1": "Lord, teach us to discern the spirit,
From soul that we Thyself may know;
Thou art the Spirit in our spirit
In oneness mingled with us so.",
"2": "Lord, teach us to discern the spirit
The soul-life ever to deny
And ever follow Thee in spirit
Thyself, the Spirit, to apply.",
"3": "Lord, teach us to discern the spirit,
That we may never set our mind,
Upon the flesh but on the spirit
That sin and self no more may bind.",
"4": "Lord, teach us to discern the spirit,
That we may never soulish be
But truly spiritual, in spirit,
To know all things discernibly.",
"5": "Lord, teach us to discern the spirit,
That subtle self exposed might be
That by the cross to it applying,
We'll live not by ourselves but Thee.",
"6": "Lord, teach us to discern the spirit,
That we may be transformed in soul
Till we're conformed to Thine own image
Till we're matured and reach the goal.",
"7": "Lord, teach us to discern the spirit
To us Thy living Word so give,
That soul from spirit be divided,
And in the holiest place we'll live."}
