{"1": "Under an eastern sky,
Amid a rabble's cry,
A Man went forth to die,
For me! for me!",
"2": "Thorn-crowned His blessed head,
Blood-stained His every tread;
Cross-laden He was led,
For me! for me!",
"3": "Pierced His hands and feet,
Three hours o'er Him beat
Fierce rays of noon-tide heat,
For me! for me!",
"4": "Thus wert Thou made all mine;
Lord, make me wholly Thine;
Grant grace and strength divine
To me! to me!",
"5": "In thought and word and deed,
Thy will to do, O lead
My soul, e'en though it bleed,
To Thee, to Thee."}
