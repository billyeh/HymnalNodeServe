{"1": ""If it die," oh, hear the message
Falling from thy Lord,
"If it die," much fruit it beareth,
'Tis thy Savior's word.",
"2": "Would'st thou see life work in others,
Thou thyself must die.
Fall into the ground, be buried,
Low in darkness lie.",
"3": "But He leaves thee not in darkness,
Light shall greet thine eyes,
And in glad new life and glory
He shall bid thee rise.",
"4": "Dost thou crave to tread the pathway
And His life to share?
As thou passest thru death's gateway
He will meet thee there.",
"5": "Thou shalt learn the blessed secret,
He shall live that dies;
From a life poured out in secret
Shall a harvest rise."}
