{"1": "Lo, the table spread before us
With the bread and with the wine:
Lo, the Savior waiting for us,
Bidding us to come and dine.
"Come and dine," the Lord is calling,
"Sup with Me and I with thee"
He's prepared for us this table-
Let us feast abundantly.",
"2": "We are feasting with our Savior,
He with us and we with Him;
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Feast of feasts that ne'er will end!
Eating, drinking with Thyself, Lord,
We are wholly satisfied.
Taste we of that glorious banquet
Thou wilt share with us, Thy Bride."}
