{"1": "Lord, Thou art with me!
Whom shall I fear?
Who then can harm me
While Thou art near?
Under Thy shadow
Is my retreat;
There to my taste,
Lord, Thy fruit is sweet.",
"2": "Lord, Thou art with me,
And Thou dost give
Strength for the journey,
Grace now to live.
Mercies each morning
Thou dost renew;
And for my prospect,
Thy rest in view.",
"3": "Lord, Thou art with me;
Onward:I move;
Each day I'm proving
More of Thy love.
Now Thou art training,
Setting me free
From all that hinders,
To dwell with Thee."}
