{"1": "The Church the lampstand is to Christ
Christ is the lamp with God as light;
The light divine from Christ doth shine
The Church upholds its glory bright.",
"2": "The light which shines within the lamp,
Is God as life, unique, divine;
The stand must therefore be of gold,
To match the glory which doth shine.",
"3": "Amid the darkness of this age,
The light of life divine doth beam,
In many centers of mankind,
Where Jesus' testimony's seen.",
"4": "To be this testimony pure,
"First love" to Christ the Church must keep;
Then from the "tree of life" she may,
The overcomer's portion reap.",
"5": "She must the persecution bear,
That she the "crown of life" may gain;
Adult'ry spiritual o'ercome
The "hidden manna" to obtain.",
"6": "The deeds of "Jezebel" desert
That she may rule the earth with might;
Defiling deadness overcome,
To be arrayed in "garments white.",
"7": "Like "Philadelphia" she must be,
To keep Christ's word, confess His Name;
All "lukewarm" pride she must o'ercome,
To feast with Him who overcame.",
"8": "Thus will the Church be purified,
To be the lampstand of pure gold
To match the testimony pure
The life of Jesus fit to hold.",
"9": "The local churches here on earth,
The lampstands in this age should be;
The glorious new Jerusalem,
The lampstand in eternity.",
"10": "That city as pure gold will be
The final lampstand consummate;
Christ as the lamp she e'er will hold,
And God's full light will radiate."}
