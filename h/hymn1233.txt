{"1": "O home in the church,
Where we've ended our search
With the brothers rejoicing all day;
Where Christ is our life,
And we're through with all strife,
Now we're home, hallelujah, to stay!",
"chorus": "Home, home in the church;
Yes, it's here that we've ended our search;
And through all our days
We will shout to His praise,
"Hallelujah for Christ and the church!"",
"2": "Here God is at rest,
Of His treasures the best-
How His heart is rejoicing all day!
His home is our heart,
Ne'er for Satan a part,
Here His glory He'll fully display.",
"chorus": "God's home is the church;
Yes, it's here that He ended His search;
And through all our days
We will shout to His praise,
"Hallelujah for Christ and the church!""}
