{"1": "The earth absorbs the soft, refreshing rain,
And sends it back in flow'rs and fruits again;
So we receive Thy life so rich and free,
And live it out for joy and praise to Thee.",
"2": "The moon receives the sun's bright, golden light,
And gives it forth to cheer the darksome night;
So we receive the rays of light Divine,
And with them on this darkened world we shine.",
"3": "'Tis by Thy love that I can love and bless
The foes who seek to blast my happiness;
Can e'en rejoice, when bearing wrong and shame,
Thou deem'st me meet to suffer for Thy name.",
"4": "Naught but Thyself can satisfy my heart,
Constrain my will from self and sin to part:
In love so great Thou giv'st Thyself to me;
That I may Thee express eternally."}
