["1 From Greenland's icy mountains,\nFrom India's coral strand,\nWhere Afric's sunny fountains\nRoll down their golden sand;\nFrom many an ancient river,\nFrom many a palmy plain,\nThey call us to deliver\nTheir land from error's chain.", "2 What though the spicy breezes\nBlow soft on Ceylon's isle;\nThough every prospect pleases,\nAnd only man is vile;\nIn vain with lavish kindness\nThe gifts of God are strown;\nThe heathen, in his blindness,\nBows down to wood and stone.", "3 Can we, whose souls are lighted\nWith wisdom from on high;\nCan we to men benighted\nThe lamp of life deny?\nSalvation! O salvation!\nThe joyful sound proclaim,\nTill each remotest nation\nHas learned Messiah's name.", "4 Waft, waft, ye winds, His story;\nAnd you, ye waters, roll,\nTill, like a sea of glory,\nIt spreads from pole to pole;\nTill o'er our ransomed nature,\nThe Lamb for sinners slain,\nRedeemer, King, Creator,\nIn bliss returns to reign."]
