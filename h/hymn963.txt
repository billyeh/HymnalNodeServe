["1 Face to face with Christ, my Savior,\nFace to face-what will it be?\nWhen with rapture I behold Him,\nJesus Christ who died for me.", "chorus Face to face I shall behold Him,\nFar beyond the starry sky;\nFace to face in all His glory,\nI shall see Him by and by!", "2 Only faintly now, I see Him,\nWith the darkling veil between,\nBut a blessed day is coming,\nWhen His glory shall be seen.", "3 What rejoicing in His presence,\nWhen are banished grief and pain;\nWhen the crooked ways are straightened,\nAnd the dark things shall be plain.", "4 Face to face! O blissful moment!\nFace to face-to see and know;\nFace to face with my Redeemer,\nJesus Christ who loves me so."]
