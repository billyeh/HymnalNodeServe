{"1": "Dear Lord, we thank Thee for this bread
It is a sign divine;
In it we see the mysteries,
Of God's unique design.",
"2": "This bread Thy body signifies
Which Thou hast giv'n for us
That we may share Thy life divine
Partaking of Thee thus.",
"3": "For us Thy body Thou didst break,
That Thou may thus impart,
Thyself as life to us that we,
May be Thy counterpart.",
"4": "This bread thus also signifies,
Thy body mystical
Of which we living members are
With Thee identical.",
"5": "Though we are many grains of wheat
Yet all one loaf, one bread;
Remembering Thee in such a way
With Thee we all are fed.",
"6": "As of this bread we all commune
Thou, Lord, dost satisfy;
With all the saints we fellowship
And Thee we testify."}
