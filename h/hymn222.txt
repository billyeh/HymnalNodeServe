["1 Dear Lord, we thank Thee for this bread\nIt is a sign divine;\nIn it we see the mysteries,\nOf God's unique design.", "2 This bread Thy body signifies\nWhich Thou hast giv'n for us\nThat we may share Thy life divine\nPartaking of Thee thus.", "3 For us Thy body Thou didst break,\nThat Thou may thus impart,\nThyself as life to us that we,\nMay be Thy counterpart.", "4 This bread thus also signifies,\nThy body mystical\nOf which we living members are\nWith Thee identical.", "5 Though we are many grains of wheat\nYet all one loaf, one bread;\nRemembering Thee in such a way\nWith Thee we all are fed.", "6 As of this bread we all commune\nThou, Lord, dost satisfy;\nWith all the saints we fellowship\nAnd Thee we testify."]
