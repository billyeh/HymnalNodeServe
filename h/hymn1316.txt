{"1": "Our Bridegroom soon is coming
To claim His holy Bride,
The ones whom He has wooed, won,
And wholly sanctified.
O Lord, we would be ready
And get our hearts in tune
For the wedding day that's coming
Very soon.",
"chorus": "Oh, the wedding day is coming,
Is coming very soon,
When the Bride shall be prepared
And shall marry her Bridegroom.
Oh, what love and consecration
Should all our hearts attune
For that wedding day that's coming
Very soon.",
"2": "Oh, that fine linen garment
Which on that day we'll wear
E'en now, Lord, work within us
And stitch by stitch prepare.
For this we would redeem
Every moment opportune
For the wedding day that's coming
Very soon.",
"3": "Lord, may Your portion in us
Continually increase
That we may be invited
Unto that wedding feast.
And keep us always watching-
At morning, night, or noon-
For the wedding day that's coming
Very soon."}
