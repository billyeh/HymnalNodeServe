["1 Our Bridegroom soon is coming\nTo claim His holy Bride,\nThe ones whom He has wooed, won,\nAnd wholly sanctified.\nO Lord, we would be ready\nAnd get our hearts in tune\nFor the wedding day that's coming\nVery soon.", "chorus Oh, the wedding day is coming,\nIs coming very soon,\nWhen the Bride shall be prepared\nAnd shall marry her Bridegroom.\nOh, what love and consecration\nShould all our hearts attune\nFor that wedding day that's coming\nVery soon.", "2 Oh, that fine linen garment\nWhich on that day we'll wear\nE'en now, Lord, work within us\nAnd stitch by stitch prepare.\nFor this we would redeem\nEvery moment opportune\nFor the wedding day that's coming\nVery soon.", "3 Lord, may Your portion in us\nContinually increase\nThat we may be invited\nUnto that wedding feast.\nAnd keep us always watching-\nAt morning, night, or noon-\nFor the wedding day that's coming\nVery soon."]
