["1 Lord Jesus Christ, we seek Thy face;\nWithin the veil we bow the knee;\nOh, let Thy glory fill the place,\nAnd bless us while we wait on Thee.", "2 We thank Thee for the precious blood\nThat purged our sins and brought us nigh;\nAll cleansed and sanctified to God,\nThy holy name to magnify.", "3 Shut in with Thee far, far above\nThe restless world that wars below;\nWe seek to learn and prove Thy love,\nThy wisdom and Thy grace to know.", "4 The brow that once with thorns was bound\nThy hands, Thy side, we fain would see;\nDraw near, Lord Jesus, glory crowned,\nAnd bless us while we wait on Thee."]
