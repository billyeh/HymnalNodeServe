{"1": "Come in, O come! the door stands open now;
I knew Thy voice; Lord Jesus, it was Thou.
The sun has set long since the storms begin;
'Tis time for Thee, my Savior, O come in!",
"2": "Alas, ill-ordered shows the dreary room;
The household stuff lies heaped amidst the gloom,
The table empty stands, the couch undressed;
Ah, what a welcome for th' Eternal Guest!",
"3": "Yet welcome, and tonight; this doleful scene
Is e'en itself my cause to hail Thee in;
This dark confusion e'en at once demands
Thine own bright presence, Lord, and ord'ring hands.",
"4": "I seek no more to alter things, or mend,
Before the coming of so great a Friend;
All were at best unseemly; and 'twere ill
Beyond all else to keep Thee waiting still.",
"5": "Come, not to find, but make this troubled heart
A dwelling worthy of Thee as Thou art;
To chase the gloom, the terror, and the sin:
Come, all Thyself, yea come, Lord Jesus, in!"}
