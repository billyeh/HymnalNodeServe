{"1": "O Everlasting Light,
Shine graciously within;
Brightest of all on earth that's bright,
Come, shine away my sin.",
"2": "O Everlasting Truth,
Truest of all that's true,
Sure guide of erring age or youth,
Lead me, and teach me too.",
"3": "O Everlasting Strength,
Uphold me in the way;
Bring me, in spite of foes, at length
To joy and light of day.",
"4": "O Everlasting Love,
Wellspring of grace and peace,
Pour down Thy fulness from above,
Bid doubt and trouble cease.",
"5": "O Everlasting Rest,
Lift off life's load of care;
Relieve, revive this burdened breast
And every sorrow bear.",
"6": "Thou art in heaven our all,
Our all on earth art Thou;
Upon Thy glorious Name we call,
Lord Jesus, bless us now."}
