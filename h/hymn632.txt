{"1": "Never further than Thy Cross,
Never higher than Thy feet,
Here earth's precious things seem dross,
Here earth's bitter things grow sweet.",
"2": "Gazing thus our sin we see,
Learn Thy love while gazing thus;
Sin which laid the Cross on Thee;
Love which bore the Cross for us.",
"3": "Here we learn to serve and give,
And rejoicing, self deny;
Here we gather love to live;
Here we gather faith to die.",
"4": "Symbols of our liberty
And our service here unite;
Captives, by Thy Cross set free;
Soldiers of Thy Cross, we fight.",
"5": "Pressing onwards as we can,
Still to this our hearts must tend;
Where our earliest hopes began,
There our last aspirings end.",
"6": "Till amid the hosts of light
We in Thee redeemed, complete,
Through Thy Cross made pure and white,
Cast our crowns before Thy feet."}
