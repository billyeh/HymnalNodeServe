{"1": "The Lord has shown the way
Within the church today-
It's laboring, laboring, laboring on Christ.
Christ is the Canaan land;
In Him we boldly stand,
While laboring, laboring, laboring on Christ.
On to victory! On to victory!
Cries our great Commander-On!
We'll move at His command
And now possess the land
Through laboring, laboring, laboring on Christ.",
"2": "The way that God has planned
To labor on the land
Is "Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen to Your Word!"
Whene'er He speaks today,
Whatever He may say,
It's "Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen to Your Word!"
On to victory! On to victory!
Cries our great Commander-On!
We'll move at His command
And now possess the land
By "Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen to Your Word!"",
"3": "The Lord has also shown
The land we'll fully own
By following, following, following the church.
Where'er the Body goes,
Howe'er the Spirit flows,
It's following, following, following the church.
On to victory! On to victory!
Cries our great Commander-On!
We'll move at His command
And now possess the land
By following, following, following the church."}
