{"1": "Our times are in Thy hand;
O God, we wish them there;
Our lives, our souls, our all, we leave
Entirely to Thy care.",
"2": "Our times are in Thy hand:
Whatever they may be;
Pleasing or painful, dark or bright,
As best may seem to Thee.",
"3": "Our times are in Thy hand;
Why should we doubt or fear?
A father's hand will never cause
His child a needless tear.",
"4": "Our times are in Thy hand;
Jesus, the Crucified,
Whose hand our many sins have pierced,
Is now our guard and guide.",
"5": "Our times are in Thy hand;
We'll always trust to Thee,
Till we possess the promised crown,
And all Thy glory see."}
