{"1": "Jesus, I live to Thee,
The Loveliest and Best;
My life in Thee, Thy life in me,
In Thy blest love I rest.",
"2": "Jesus, I die to Thee,
Whenever death shall come;
To die in Thee is life to me,
With Thee I'm ever one!",
"3": "Whether to live or die,
I know not which is best;
To live in Thee is bliss to me,
To die is endless rest.",
"4": "Living or dying, Lord,
I ask but to be Thine;
My life in Thee, Thy life in me,
Makes Thee forever mine."}
