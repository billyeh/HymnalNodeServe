["1 Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish;\nCome to the mercy-seat, fervently kneel;\nHere bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish,\nEarth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.", "2 Joy of the comfortless, light of the straying,\nHope of the penitent, fadeless and pure;\nHere speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying-\nEarth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure.", "3 Here see the Bread of Life; see waters flowing\nForth from the throne of God, pure from above;\nCome to the feast of love; come, ever knowing\nEarth has no sorrow but heaven can remove."]
