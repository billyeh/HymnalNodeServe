["1 The kingdom of God is at hand:\nTen virgins with lamps lit arise\nTo go forth to meet the Bridegroom,\nBut only five virgins are wise.\nThe wise have abundance of oil,\nThe foolish are empty instead;\nThe wise used their time to buy oil,\nThe others their chance forfeited.", "2 Lord Jesus, Thy message is clear:\nYou're coming for those who are wise,\nWho buy up their oil today,\nWho deal with all hindering ties.\nThose virgins whose souls are transformed,\nWhose vessels much oil contain,\nWho love not their lives unto death-\nThey in Thy great kingdom shall reign.", "3 Our lamps to shine forth must be trimmed\nBy calling on Thee every day.\nIn spirit we must exercise\nTo burn all the oldness away.\nBut there is a much deeper need:\nReality in us must grow,\nUntil it makes home in our hearts,\nTill oil in our vessels o'erflows.", "4 We see how this age is so dark,\nWe know that blest hour is near.\nOur Lord may return anytime-\nLord, strike in us this holy fear,\nThat we may each moment redeem\nBy taking Thy Word in by prayer,\nBy learning each lesson You give,\nAnd thus for that hour prepare.", "5 Lord Jesus, how blest to be those\nWho bring in Thy kingdom to earth,\nAffording Thee rule over all\nAnd showing to all Thy great worth!\nHow blest to be those at the feast,\nWhere Thou wilt be one with Thy Bride!\nLord, make us wise virgins for Thee,\nWho e'er in Thy presence abide."]
