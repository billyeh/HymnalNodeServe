{"1": "Lord Jesus, Thy redeemed ones,
Are Thy Body and Thy Bride;
As Thy fulness, Thine expression
In her Thou art glorified.
Thou, her all in all forever
She Thy riches doth declare;
Thou dost fully saturate her,
And Thy glory with her share.",
"chorus": "Lo, the holy city
Full of God's bright glory!
It is God's complete expression,
In humanity.",
"2": "God with man completely blended
Mystery of godliness.
God in glory, full, resplendent
Man, His dwelling, doth express.
'Tis a vessel universal,
All God's fulness to express;
All His beauty manifesting
Mingled with His holiness.",
"3": "'Tis a living composition,
Of the saints He hath transformed;
As the pearls and stones most precious
To His image they're conformed:
From the throne of God, its center
Flows the living water free;
Christ the tree of life doth flourish
Bearing fruit abundantly.",
"4": "'Tis th' eternal golden lampstand
Holding Christ, the lamp of light;
God in Christ the light of glory,
As the Spirit shineth bright!
'Tis the ultimate expression-
Man in God and God in man;
'Tis their mutual habitation
Goal of God's eternal plan."}
