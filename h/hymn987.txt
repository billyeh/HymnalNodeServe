["1 One day when heaven was filled with His praises,\nOne day when sin was as black as could be,\nJesus came forth to be born of a virgin-\nDwelt among men, my example is He!", "chorus Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;\nBuried, He carried my sins far away;\nRising, He justified freely forever:\nOne day He's coming-O glorious day!", "2 One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain,\nOne day they nailed Him to die on the tree;\nSuffering anguish, despised and rejected;\nBearing our sins, my Redeemer is He.", "3 One day they left Him alone in the garden,\nOne day He rested, from suffering free;\nAngels came down o'er His tomb to keep vigil;\nHope of the hopeless, my Savior is He.", "4 One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,\nOne day the stone rolled away from the door;\nThen He arose, over death He had conquered;\nNow is ascended, my Lord evermore.", "5 One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,\nOne day the skies with His glory will shine;\nWonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;\nGlorious Savior, this Jesus is mine!"]
