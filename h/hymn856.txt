{"1": "How pleasant and how good it is
When brethren in the Lord
In one another's joy delight
And dwell in sweet accord.",
"2": "Such oneness, like anointing oil
On head to body poured;
Such oneness, like the morning dew,
With sweet refreshment stored.",
"3": "To those who dwell in brotherhood
The Lord His blessing sends,
He crowns them with the bliss of life,
Of life that never ends."}
