{"1": "The principle of incarnation,
Is but the blend of God and man
Both acting in cooperation,
To thus fulfill th' eternal plan.",
"2": "To God, the man is His expression
And man is of God's life possessed;
The man is wholly God's possession
And God thru man is thus expressed.",
"3": "Redemption is accomplished fully,
In man, God's wisdom thus to show;
Salvation is expounded wholly,
By man, that all creation know.",
"4": "God's service in this dispensation,
Requires that man should work with Him;
Thus God and man in close relation,
And joint dependence work therein.",
"5": "It is not God Himself to labor
Nor man to try to serve alone
But God and man to work together,
Each moment that His plan be shown.",
"6": "The principle of incarnation,
To all our work we must apply
To all our gift and operation
That we as one may serve thereby."}
