["1 The principle of incarnation,\nIs but the blend of God and man\nBoth acting in cooperation,\nTo thus fulfill th' eternal plan.", "2 To God, the man is His expression\nAnd man is of God's life possessed;\nThe man is wholly God's possession\nAnd God thru man is thus expressed.", "3 Redemption is accomplished fully,\nIn man, God's wisdom thus to show;\nSalvation is expounded wholly,\nBy man, that all creation know.", "4 God's service in this dispensation,\nRequires that man should work with Him;\nThus God and man in close relation,\nAnd joint dependence work therein.", "5 It is not God Himself to labor\nNor man to try to serve alone\nBut God and man to work together,\nEach moment that His plan be shown.", "6 The principle of incarnation,\nTo all our work we must apply\nTo all our gift and operation\nThat we as one may serve thereby."]
