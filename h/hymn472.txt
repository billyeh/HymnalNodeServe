["1 Many crowd the Savior's kingdom,\nFew receive His cross;\nMany seek His consolation,\nFew will suffer loss.\nFor the dear sake of the Master,\nCounting all but dross,\nFor the dear sake of the Master,\nCounting all but dross.", "2 Many sit at Jesus' table,\nFew will fast with Him,\nWhen the sorrow-cup of anguish\nTrembles to the brim.\nFew watch with Him in the garden,\nWho have sung the hymn,\nFew watch with Him in the garden,\nWho have sung the hymn.", "3 Many will confess His wisdom,\nFew embrace His shame.\nMany, should He smile upon them,\nWill His praise proclaim;\nThen, if for a while He leave them,\nThey desert His name,\nThen, if for a while He leave them,\nThey desert His name.", "4 But the souls who love Him truly,\nLet woe come or bliss,\nThese will count their dearest hearts' blood\nNot their own, but His.\nSavior, Thou who thus hast loved me,\nGive me love like this,\nSavior, Thou who thus hast loved me,\nGive me love like this."]
