["1 From my spirit within flows a fountain of life-\nThe Triune God flowing in me;\nGod the Father's the source, Christ the Son is the course,\nAnd the Spirit imparts life to me.", "chorus Lord, I treasure the sweet flow of life,\nAnd my soul-life at last I lay down;\nO Lord, deepen the pure flow of life;\nAt Your coming may life be my crown.", "2 In the fresh, tender grass Jesus makes me lie down;\nHe leads me by waters of rest;\nNo more struggle and strain; all self-effort is vain;\nIn the flow I am perfectly blessed.", "3 Jesus called me one day to the Holiest Place,\nTo live in His presence divine;\nHallelujah, I've heard an encouraging word:\n\"Abide-you're a branch in the vine.\""]
