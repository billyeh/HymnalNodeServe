["1 The Lord shall get the glory\nIf we will sing His praise,\nAnd angel hosts will listen\nWhen we our voices raise;\nThe world around will hear us\nGive glory unto God,\nAnd Satan's hosts will tremble\nAnd flee our conqu'ring rod.", "2 Our mouth shut up defeats us\nAnd wins the Devil's smile;\nSo why not open battle\nAnd chase him all the while.\nBy \"sacrifice of praises\"\nAnd shouts of victory-\n'Twill cost us but our faces\nGod's chosen fools to be!", "3 The world has never helped us\nTo shout our Savior's praise,\nNor given Him the glory\nNor lent one thankful phrase;\nSo need we ask permission\nTo praise th' ascended Lord?\nCry out! Release your spirit!\nMuch grace He does afford!", "4 O brothers, be not silent!\nO sisters, cry aloud!\nThe sound shall tell God's triumph\nAnd blessings far abroad.\nNow is the time to praise Him,\nYes now, at any cost!\nO joy in your salvation,\nAnd in His mercy boast."]
