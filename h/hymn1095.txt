{"1": "The Lord shall get the glory
If we will sing His praise,
And angel hosts will listen
When we our voices raise;
The world around will hear us
Give glory unto God,
And Satan's hosts will tremble
And flee our conqu'ring rod.",
"2": "Our mouth shut up defeats us
And wins the Devil's smile;
So why not open battle
And chase him all the while.
By "sacrifice of praises"
And shouts of victory-
'Twill cost us but our faces
God's chosen fools to be!",
"3": "The world has never helped us
To shout our Savior's praise,
Nor given Him the glory
Nor lent one thankful phrase;
So need we ask permission
To praise th' ascended Lord?
Cry out! Release your spirit!
Much grace He does afford!",
"4": "O brothers, be not silent!
O sisters, cry aloud!
The sound shall tell God's triumph
And blessings far abroad.
Now is the time to praise Him,
Yes now, at any cost!
O joy in your salvation,
And in His mercy boast."}
