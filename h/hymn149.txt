["1 Hark! Ten thousand heav'nly voices\nSound the note of praise above;\nJesus reigns and heav'n rejoices,\nJesus reigns, the God of love.\nSee, He sits on yonder throne;\nJesus rules the world alone.", "chorus Hallelujah, Hallelujah,\nHallelujah, Amen.", "2 Sing how Jesus came from heaven,\nHow He bore the cross below,\nHow all power to Him is given,\nHow He reigns in glory now.\n'Tis a great and endless theme-\nOh, 'tis sweet to sing of Him.", "3 Jesus, hail! Thy glory brightens\nAll above and gives it worth;\nLord of life, Thy smile enlightens,\nCheers, and charms Thy saints on earth.\nWhen we think of love like Thine,\nLord, we own it love divine.", "4 King of glory, reign forever!\nThine an everlasting crown.\nNothing from Thy love shall sever\nThose whom Thou hast made Thine own:\nHappy objects of Thy grace,\nDestined to behold Thy face.", "5 Savior, hasten Thine appearing:\nBring, oh, bring the glorious day,\nWhen, the awful summons hearing,\nHeav'n and earth shall pass away.\nThen with raptured hearts we'll sing,\n\"Glory, glory to our King!\""]
