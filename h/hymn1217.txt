Unto the most Holy Place,
To behold shekinah glory
Shining from Your blessed face.",

Through the incense altar's prayer;
No more veil of separation,
We may boldly enter there.",

Freshly cut and freshly slain,
To the Holiest of Holies;
Glorious access we obtain.",

Who is sitting on the throne;
He has paved the way to glory
By His blood and cross alone.",

With assured heart, true and bold.
To enjoy th' eternal purpose,
Ne'er to shrink back to the old.",

Now within the Holiest,
You're our God and we're Your people;
Here we dwell forever blest."}
