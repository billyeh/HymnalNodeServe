["1 On the Lord's day, John, in spirit,\nHeard a voice and turned and saw\nSeven lampstands brightly shining;\nOf pure gold, divine, they were.\nIn the midst of them, appearing,\nHe beheld the Son of Man,\nEver for the churches caring,\nTending God's eternal plan.", "2 His appearance, lo, how different\nFrom the One John knew before.\nNow He's girt in golden raiment,\nNot the robe which then He wore.\nGirt about the breasts and serving,\nHe the priesthood fully bears;\nCherishing the lampstands dearly,\nHe for all the churches cares.", "3 Ancient One He is, yet fresher\nThan the newly driven snow;\nEyes are as a flaming fire,\nFeet as burnished brass aglow.\nTender eyes that gazed at Peter,\nNow are as a burning flame;\nAnd the voice that whispered, \"Mary,\"\nMany waters now became.", "4 John, once formerly reclining\nOn His breast, now fell as dead,\nWhen he saw Him thus in spirit,\nAs He is, exhibited.\nLo, the Christ of Revelation!\nSee Him, thus intensified,\nThat the lampstands, His expression,\nMay be strengthened and supplied."]
