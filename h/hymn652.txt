{"1": "O troubled soul, beneath the rod
Thy Father speaks-be still, be still;
Learn to be silent unto God,
And let Him mold thee to His will.",
"chorus": "Be still, O troubled soul, be still;
Fear not, thy Father's arms enfold thee.
Take up thy cross, lay down thy will;
Be silent unto God, and let Him mold thee.",
"2": "O anxious soul, lay down thy load,
Oh, hear His voice, He speaks to thee,
"Be still and know that I am God,
And cast thy every care on Me."",
"3": "O fearful soul, be still, be still,
Be of good cheer; has He not said,
"I will be with you, fear no ill,
'Tis I, 'tis I, be not afraid"?",
"4": "O praying soul, be still, be still,
He cannot break His plighted word;
Sink down into His blessed will,
And wait in patience on the Lord.",
"5": "O waiting soul, be still, be strong,
And though He tarry, trust and wait;
Doubt not, He will not wait too long,
Fear not, He will not come too late."}
