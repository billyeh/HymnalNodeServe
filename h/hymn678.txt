I will not be afraid;
I will look upward,
And travel onward,
And not be afraid.",

He says He will be with me;
He goes before me,
And is beside me,
So I'm not afraid.",

His arms are underneath me;
His hand upholds me,
His love enfolds me,
So I'm not afraid.",
"4": "His Word will stand for ever;
His Word will stand for ever;
His truth it shall be
My shield and buckler,
So I'm not afraid.",
"5": "He will give grace and glory;
He will give grace and glory;
His cross before me,
His banner o'er me,
So I'm not afraid.",
"6": "So we go singing onward;
So we go singing onward;
We're pressing forward,
We're marching upward,
To Him unafraid."}
