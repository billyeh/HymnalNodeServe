["1 Jesus Himself drew near,\nAnd joined them as they walked,\nAnd soon their hearts began to burn,\nAs of Himself He talked:\nDraw near, O Lord.", "2 Jesus Himself drew near,\nThey were no longer sad;\nWhen He was walking at their side,\nHow could they but be glad?\nDraw near, O Lord.", "3 Jesus Himself drew near,\nAnd all their doubts were solved;\nHe showed them why Christ came to die,\nAnd what that death involved:\nDraw near, O Lord.", "4 Jesus Himself drew near,\nAnd at the journey's end\nThey could not let Him leave them thus,\nThe Stranger was their Friend:\nDraw near, O Lord."]
