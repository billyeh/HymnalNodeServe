{"1": "Jesus Himself drew near,
And joined them as they walked,
And soon their hearts began to burn,
As of Himself He talked:
Draw near, O Lord.",
"2": "Jesus Himself drew near,
They were no longer sad;
When He was walking at their side,
How could they but be glad?
Draw near, O Lord.",
"3": "Jesus Himself drew near,
And all their doubts were solved;
He showed them why Christ came to die,
And what that death involved:
Draw near, O Lord.",
"4": "Jesus Himself drew near,
And at the journey's end
They could not let Him leave them thus,
The Stranger was their Friend:
Draw near, O Lord."}
