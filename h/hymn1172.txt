{"1": "Lo, the conflict of the ages
Is upon us today,
And the forces of rebellion
Are in total array.
The humanity of Jesus
Now the saints must possess,
His true image and dominion
On the earth to express.",
"chorus": "Let us stand up in Jesus
In His full human life,
Human virtues prevailing
'Gainst corruption so rife;
In this wickedness concerted,
In this age perverse, perverted,
The humanity of Jesus
Must the church now display.",
"2": "Lo, how Satan came to damage
Human life on the earth;
But the Lord in all this ruin
Raised a man full of worth!
From the seed of the woman
God incarnate became
The man Jesus-the last Adam-
To destroy Satan's aim!",
"3": "It's by calling, drinking, eating
The man Jesus today,
His humanity enjoying
Bruises Satan each day.
To the Lord we must be turning,
All our soul life deny,
To destroy all Satan's working
And the new man supply.",
"4": "See the ruin of a nation
Going downward in sin;
All humanity is fallen
And corrupted within.
But as children of the kingdom
We are salting the earth;
His humanity preserves us
In the midst of such dearth."}
