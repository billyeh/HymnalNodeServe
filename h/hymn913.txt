{"1": "Serve and work within the Body
This the Lord doth signify;
For His purpose is the Body
And with it we must comply.",
"chorus": "Serve and work within the Body
Never independently;
As the members of the Body
Functioning relatedly.",
"2": "As the members we've been quickened,
Not as individuals free;
We must always serve together
All related mutually.",
"3": "Living stones, we're built together,
And a house for God must be
As the holy priesthood serving
In a blessed harmony.",
"4": "Thus we must be built together
In position minister;
For the basis of our service,
Is the body character.",
"5": "In our ministry and service
From the Body, our supply;
If detached and isolated
Out of function we will die.",
"6": "'Tis by serving in the Body,
Riches of the Head we share;
'Tis by functioning as members,
Christ's full measure we will bear.",
"7": "To the Head fast holding ever
That we may together grow
From the Head supplies incoming,
Thru us to the Body flow.",
"8": "Lord, anew we give our bodies;
May we be transformed to prove,
All Thy will, to know Thy Body
And therein to serve and move."}
