{"1": "God's eternal purpose,
Is to join with man
Causing man, His vessel
To be born again
His own life imparting
Filling to the brim;
Man may thus express Him
And be one with Him.",
"2": "God in His own image,
Hath created man
That he may be able,
To fulfill His plan;
That he may receive Him,
As the tree of life,
To become His fulness,
As to man the wife.",
"3": "In His life's rich flowing,
Man will be transformed,
Into precious substance,
And to Him conformed.
Thus will man be builded,
As His counterpart
Thus to be His dwelling
Satisfy His heart.",
"4": "'Tis the holy city
New Jerusalem;
With His saints God mingles
Makes His home with them.
He becomes their content
His expression they;
They shall share His glory
One with Him for aye.",
"5": "He's the very center
Ruling on the throne;
By His life the power
Saints are kept in one.
By His light of glory
They are kept in light
Harmony enjoying,
In divine delight.",
"6": "He's their living water
And their food supply;
All their thirst and hunger,
He doth satisfy.
He's for them the temple
In Himself they live
In His constant presence,
Worship ever give."}
