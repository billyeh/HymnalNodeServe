["1 If the path I travel\nLead me to the cross,\nIf the way Thou choosest\nLead to pain and loss,\nLet the compensation\nDaily, hourly, be\nShadowless communion,\nBlessed Lord, with Thee.", "2 If there's less of earth joy,\nGive, Lord, more of heaven.\nLet the spirit praise Thee,\nThough the heart be riven;\nIf sweet earthly ties, Lord,\nBreak at Thy decree,\nLet the tie that binds us,\nCloser, sweeter, be.", "3 Lonely though the pathway,\nCheer it with Thy smile;\nBe Thou my companion\nThrough earth's little while;\nSelfless may I live, Lord,\nBy Thy grace to be\nJust a cleansed channel\nFor Thy life through me."]
