["1 She only touched the hem of His garment\nAs to His side she stole,\nAmid the crowd that gathered around Him;\nAnd straightway she was whole.", "chorus Oh, touch the hem of His garment!\nAnd thou, too, shalt be free!\nHis saving power this very hour\nShall give new life to thee!", "2 He's pow'rful, present, real and gracious;\nThou too canst touch Him now!\nJust come and touch while He is still passing,\nHis power thou shalt know.", "3 Just touch in faith and touch Him in spirit,\nAnd He will make thee whole;\nAnd peace that passeth all understanding\nWith joy will fill thy soul."]
