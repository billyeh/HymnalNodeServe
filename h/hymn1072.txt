{"1": "She only touched the hem of His garment
As to His side she stole,
Amid the crowd that gathered around Him;
And straightway she was whole.",
"chorus": "Oh, touch the hem of His garment!
And thou, too, shalt be free!
His saving power this very hour
Shall give new life to thee!",
"2": "He's pow'rful, present, real and gracious;
Thou too canst touch Him now!
Just come and touch while He is still passing,
His power thou shalt know.",
"3": "Just touch in faith and touch Him in spirit,
And He will make thee whole;
And peace that passeth all understanding
With joy will fill thy soul."}
