{"1": "Who can tell how soon the Bride may hear the cry,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
Hear the shout of triumph ringing in the sky,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"",
"chorus": "We can almost see His glory in the sky;
It must be the dawning of that day is nigh.
How our hearts would leap if we should hear the cry,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"",

"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
Extra oil have ready should you hear tonight
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"",

"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
Spots and wrinkles cleanse before the shout is heard,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"",

"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
Ready be to match Him now without delay,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"",

"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
Acts of righteousness will make her rapture sure,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"",
"6": "Hark! As one the Spirit and the Bride doth say,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
Brothers, sisters, this may be the wedding day!
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!""}
