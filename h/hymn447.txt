From sin's dominion free,
For warfare and for triumph,
As weapons unto Thee.",

To live, my Lord, by Thee;
Now, Son of God, my Savior,
Live out Thy life in me.",

Washed in Thy precious blood,
Sealed by Thy Holy Spirit,
A sacrifice to God.",

I'm waiting for the fire;
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting;
I'm waiting for the fire."}
