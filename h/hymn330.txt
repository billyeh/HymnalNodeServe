["1 My faith has found a resting place,\nNot in device nor creed;\nI trust the Ever-living One,\nHis wounds for me shall plead.", "chorus I need no other argument,\nI need no other plea;\nIt is enough that Jesus died,\nAnd that He died for me.", "2 Enough for me that Jesus saves,\nThis ends my fear and doubt;\nA sinful soul I come to Him,\nHe'll never cast me out.", "3 My heart is leaning on the Word,\nThe written Word of God,\nSalvation by my Savior's name,\nSalvation through His blood.", "4 My great Physician heals the sick,\nThe lost He came to save;\nFor me His precious blood He shed,\nFor me His life He gave."]
