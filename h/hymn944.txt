["1 The essence of the Kingdom is,\nA life that's under heaven's rule\nA life whose nature is divine,\nWith Christ experienced in full.", "2 Such is this life: \"in spirit poor\nWith heart repentant, mourning, meek\nWhich is to others merciful,\nAnd purely God Himself doth seek;", "3 As sons of God the peace to make\nFor righteousness e'en suffering pain;\nReviled and hurt for Jesus' sake\nExceeding joyfulness to gain;", "4 As salt to kill corruption rife\nIn darkness shining as the light\nIn heart and action right and true\nIn perfect love to claim no right.", "5 This life self-glory doth renounce,\nAnd ever for God's kingdom prays;\nIt trusts in God for every need,\nAnd seeks His kingdom first always.", "6 'Tis strict with self, with others kind\nAnd always dealing with the Lord;\nIt ever does the Father's will,\nAnd acts according to His word.", "7 To Satan it does not give ground\nNor to the world, or self, or sin\nBut seeks beneath the heaven's rule,\nGod's full authority to win.", "8 'Tis such a life which subjugates,\nAll things with pow'r to God's behest;\nThe time it hastens when the Lord,\nWill here His kingdom manifest."]
