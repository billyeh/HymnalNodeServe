{"1": "The essence of the Kingdom is,
A life that's under heaven's rule
A life whose nature is divine,
With Christ experienced in full.",
"2": "Such is this life: "in spirit poor
With heart repentant, mourning, meek
Which is to others merciful,
And purely God Himself doth seek;",
"3": "As sons of God the peace to make
For righteousness e'en suffering pain;
Reviled and hurt for Jesus' sake
Exceeding joyfulness to gain;",
"4": "As salt to kill corruption rife
In darkness shining as the light
In heart and action right and true
In perfect love to claim no right.",
"5": "This life self-glory doth renounce,
And ever for God's kingdom prays;
It trusts in God for every need,
And seeks His kingdom first always.",
"6": "'Tis strict with self, with others kind
And always dealing with the Lord;
It ever does the Father's will,
And acts according to His word.",
"7": "To Satan it does not give ground
Nor to the world, or self, or sin
But seeks beneath the heaven's rule,
God's full authority to win.",
"8": "'Tis such a life which subjugates,
All things with pow'r to God's behest;
The time it hastens when the Lord,
Will here His kingdom manifest."}
