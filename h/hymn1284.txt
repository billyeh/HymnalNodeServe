["1 Our eyes have seen the vision:\nThe goal is now in view,\nChrist has defeated Satan,\nAnd sin and death are through.\nThe way is cut and open,\nThe paths are all made straight;\nWe've heard the call: \"Come forward!\nWe've laid aside each weight.", "chorus Come forward! Come forward!\nOur Christ is on the throne.\nHis ministry, so heavenly,\nBrings all-brings all the fighters home.", "2 Our eyes have seen the vision\nSince Christ our conquering King\nHas called us to the battle,\nWhich He did surely win.\nThe vict'ry He bequested\nTwo thousand years ago\nTo all the glorious fighters\nWho'll forward with Him go.", "3 Our eyes have seen the vision.\nOur Captain leads us on.\nTo press into our spirit,\nTo share with Him the throne.\nLord, Thou hast giv'n Thy soldiers\nThe pow'r to wield the sword,\nAnd made us glorious fighters\nThrough Spirit, church, and Word."]
