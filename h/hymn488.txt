["1 Lord, Thou hast shown the mystery\nHow on the Cross I died with Thee;\nI need no other pow'r or way,\nThat I may triumph day by day.", "2 That cross of Thine is also mine\nInto my life its light doth shine;\nWhen I believe I'm dead with Thee\nThe world has lost its pow'r o'er me.", "3 Since I am crucified with Thee\nFrom sin and self I am set free;\nHow can I still enjoy the world,\nOr seek its vanities unfurled?", "4 I take my place, dear Lord, with Thee,\nUpon the cross of Calvary.\nThy life and power then are mine\nSince Thou and I in oneness twine.", "5 Since Thou didst come to slay the foe\nHis work and power to overthrow\nI too can overcome in Thee,\nAnd prove Thy mighty pow'r in me.", "6 Yet, for the vict'ry we rely,\nUpon the death which Thou didst die;\nWe tread the path which Thou hast trod,\nUntil we reach the goal in God.", "7 My death with Thee I now believe,\nAnd all its meaning would receive.\nThy death more deeply show to me\nThat from my flesh I may be free.", "8 I long to win as Thou hast won\nTo reign with Thee when Thou dost come.\nIf we the cross will gladly bear\nThen in Thy glory we will share."]
