["1 Far, far away, in heathen darkness dwelling,\nMillions of souls forever may be lost;\nWho, who will go, salvation's story telling,\nLooking to Jesus, counting not the cost?", "chorus \"All pow'r is given unto me,\nAll pow'r is given unto me,\nGo ye into all the world and preach the gospel,\nAnd lo, I am with you alway.\"", "2 See o'er the world, wide open doors inviting:\nSoldiers of Christ, arise and enter in!\nChristians, awake! your forces all uniting,\nSend forth the Gospel, break the chains of sin.", "3 \"Why will ye die?\" the voice of God is calling,\n\"Why will ye die?\" re-echo in His name:\nJesus hath died to save from death appalling,\nLife and salvation therefore go proclaim."]
