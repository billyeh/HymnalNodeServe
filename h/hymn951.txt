{"1": "Christ is coming! let creation
From her groans and travail cease,
Let the glorious proclamation
Hope restore, and faith increase.
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace.",
"2": "Earth can now but tell the story
Of Thy bitter cross and pain;
She shall yet behold Thy glory
When Thou comest back to reign.
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Let each heart repeat the strain.",
"3": "Long Thy people have been pining
For Thy peace and rest, and Thee,
Soon, in heav'nly glory shining,
Their Restorer shall they see.
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Haste the joyous jubilee.",
"4": "With that blessed hope before us,
Let no harp remain unstrung;
Let the mighty advent chorus
Onward roll on every tongue.
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come."}
