["1 Lord, we meet to seek Thy face,\nAnd in one accord to pray;\nWe a holy priesthood are\nWaiting on Thee here today.", "chorus Here together we would pray\nTouch the highest and the best\nTill our spirits mingled are,\nAnd Thy Church is built and blest.", "2 As true priests we long to be\nWith our spirit sense Thy will\nThus to serve before Thee here,\nThat Thy plan Thou may fulfill.", "3 To the holiest place we come\nNow to touch Thy throne of grace\nBy the inner sense to pray,\nAnd Thy Spirit's flow to trace.", "4 From Thy throne of grace to me,\nRivers of Thy grace proceed;\nThus my spirit is refreshed\nHelping me in time of need.", "5 May our prayers expression give,\nTo Thy Spirit's mind alone;\nPraying not by our desire\nBut according to Thine own.", "6 Though with temporal matters pressed\nWhich we fain would bring to Thee\nRather than Thy care to seek\nWe would here Thy channel be.", "7 Here we seek Thy list'ning ear,\nMay Thy living water flow;\nWhen Thy grace does satisfy\nOnly then Thy work we'll know."]
