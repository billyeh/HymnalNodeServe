{"1": "Lord, we meet to seek Thy face,
And in one accord to pray;
We a holy priesthood are
Waiting on Thee here today.",
"chorus": "Here together we would pray
Touch the highest and the best
Till our spirits mingled are,
And Thy Church is built and blest.",
"2": "As true priests we long to be
With our spirit sense Thy will
Thus to serve before Thee here,
That Thy plan Thou may fulfill.",
"3": "To the holiest place we come
Now to touch Thy throne of grace
By the inner sense to pray,
And Thy Spirit's flow to trace.",
"4": "From Thy throne of grace to me,
Rivers of Thy grace proceed;
Thus my spirit is refreshed
Helping me in time of need.",
"5": "May our prayers expression give,
To Thy Spirit's mind alone;
Praying not by our desire
But according to Thine own.",
"6": "Though with temporal matters pressed
Which we fain would bring to Thee
Rather than Thy care to seek
We would here Thy channel be.",
"7": "Here we seek Thy list'ning ear,
May Thy living water flow;
When Thy grace does satisfy
Only then Thy work we'll know."}
