{"1": "On the table of Thy love
With the bread, the cup is spread.
By partaking of these signs
We with Thee are richly fed.
How we thank Thee for this cup
For the cup of blessing, Lord
Cup of Thy Salvation full
Cup of all Thou dost afford.",
"2": "'Tis the blood Thou shedd'st for us
That our sins may be forgiv'n;
'Tis the cov'nant made for us
That Thy blessings may be giv'n.
Thou didst drink the cup of wrath
Thou hast tasted death for us
Thus the cup of blessing bought
As the portion gained for us.",
"3": "In this portion we have God
Whom we lost thru Adam's fall;
By the shedding of Thy blood
God becomes our all in all.
In this portion all we have-
Life and peace, redemption sure;
All that God has planned and willed
In this portion we secure.",
"4": "An eternal portion, 'tis
Overflowing cup divine;
Heav'nly taste do we enjoy,
In this cup of God's design.
Here in love we drink this cup,
In remembrance, Lord, of Thee;
Thus in spirit we partake,
All Thy work on Calvary."}
