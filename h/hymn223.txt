["1 On the table of Thy love\nWith the bread, the cup is spread.\nBy partaking of these signs\nWe with Thee are richly fed.\nHow we thank Thee for this cup\nFor the cup of blessing, Lord\nCup of Thy Salvation full\nCup of all Thou dost afford.", "2 'Tis the blood Thou shedd'st for us\nThat our sins may be forgiv'n;\n'Tis the cov'nant made for us\nThat Thy blessings may be giv'n.\nThou didst drink the cup of wrath\nThou hast tasted death for us\nThus the cup of blessing bought\nAs the portion gained for us.", "3 In this portion we have God\nWhom we lost thru Adam's fall;\nBy the shedding of Thy blood\nGod becomes our all in all.\nIn this portion all we have-\nLife and peace, redemption sure;\nAll that God has planned and willed\nIn this portion we secure.", "4 An eternal portion, 'tis\nOverflowing cup divine;\nHeav'nly taste do we enjoy,\nIn this cup of God's design.\nHere in love we drink this cup,\nIn remembrance, Lord, of Thee;\nThus in spirit we partake,\nAll Thy work on Calvary."]
