Thy mighty arm make bare;
Move in the hearts and wake the souls,
And make Thy presence dear.",
"chorus": "Revive Thy work, dear Lord!
And manifest Thy power;
O come upon Thy church as in
The Pentecostal hour.",

Disturb this sleep of death;
Quicken the smouldering embers now
By Thine almighty breath.",
"3": "Revive Thy work, dear Lord!
Create soul-thirst for Thee;
And hungering for the Bread of Life,
O may our spirits be!",
"4": "Revive Thy work, dear Lord!
And give abounding joy;
O fill our hearts with perfect love,
And burn out all alloy!",
"5": "Revive Thy work, dear Lord!
Repeat Thy deeds of grace;
Thy mighty name be magnified,
To Thee be all the praise."}
