{"1": "God's Kingdom on the earth is now,
His sovereign government within;
'Tis Christ Himself in us to live,
As Lord and King to rule and reign.",
"2": "His life with His authority,
Enthrones Him now within our hearts,
To govern all our words and deeds,
And regulate our inward parts.",
"3": "The Lord enthroned within our hearts,
His Kingdom doth establish there
Assuring His full right to reign,
And for God's purpose to prepare.",
"4": "'Tis by His reign within our hearts,
That life to us He e'er supplies;
When taking Him as Lord and King
His wealth our being satisfies.",
"5": "'Tis by His ruling from within,
His fulness vast is testified;
'Tis when His inner kingdom rules,
His Body's blessed and edified.",
"6": "'Tis by His heav'nly rule within,
As heav'nly citizens we live;
'Tis by submission to His rule,
Expression of His reign we give.",
"7": "Here in this heav'nly realm we live
And with this heav'nly pow'r possessed,
We walk and fight in heav'nly light,
Until the Kingdom's manifest."}
