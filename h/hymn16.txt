{"1": "Our Father, as the evergreen
Thou art forever new;
Thou art the ever living Lord
Thy freshness as the dew.",
"chorus": "O Father, Thou art unchanging
Thou never hast grown old;
Thru countless ages, ever fresh
Thy newness doth unfold.",
"2": "O Thou art God, and Thou art "new"
Without Thee all is worn
But all with Thee is ever fresh
Though many years have gone.",
"3": "Each blessing Thou hast given us,
Thy newness doth contain;
Thy covenant, Thy ways are new
And ever thus remain.",
"4": "Now we Thy new creation are-
New spirit and new heart;
We're daily from the old renewed
New life Thou dost impart.",
"5": "The earth and heavens will be new,
And Thy new city share;
New fruits each month will be supplied
For all is newness there.",
"6": "O Father, Thou art ever new
And all is new in Thee;
We sing the new eternal song
New praise we give to Thee."}
