{"1": "Grace in its highest definition is,
God in the Son to be enjoyed by us;
It is not only something done or giv'n
But God Himself, our portion glorious.",
"2": "God is incarnate in the flesh that we,
Him may receive, experience ourself;
This is the grace which we receive of God
Which comes thru Christ and which is Christ Himself.",
"3": "Paul the Apostle counted all as dung
'Twas only God in Christ he counted grace;
'Tis by this grace-the Lord experienced-
That he surpassed the others in the race.",
"4": "It is this grace-Christ as our inward strength-
Which with His all-sufficiency doth fill;
It is this grace which in our spirit is
There energizing, working out God's will.",
"5": "This grace, which is the living Christ Himself
Is what we need and must experience;
Lord, may we know this grace and by it live
Thyself increasingly as grace to sense."}
