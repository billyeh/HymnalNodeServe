{"1": "To the lost world minister Christ
Not just by word, but by life
Imparting Christ by living deeds,
To the poor souls living in strife.",
"chorus": "To the lost world minister Christ
By daily walk making Him known;
Imparting Christ by whom you live
Share with all men what you own.",
"2": "To the lost world minister Christ
The precious One you possess
Imparting Christ to those you love,
As all their gain and success.",
"3": "To the lost world minister Christ
The very Christ you enjoy
Imparting Christ to all your friends,
As all their boast and their joy.",
"4": "To the lost world minister Christ
Who is your life and your all
Imparting Christ to all you meet
All fallen ones, great or small."}
