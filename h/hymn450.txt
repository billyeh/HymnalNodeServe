{"1": "Lie still, and let Him mould thee!
Oh, Lord, I would obey;
Be Thou the skillful Potter,
And I the yielding clay.",
"chorus": "Bend me, oh, bend me to Thy will,
While in Thy hand I'm lying still.",
"2": "In Thy dear hand I'm resting,
Oh, hold me quiet there;
Then soften me and mould me,
And for Thy will prepare.",
"3": "I need not fear to trust Thee,
Thy love and skill are such,
New lessons Thou wilt teach me,
While yielding to Thy touch.",
"4": "Impress Thine image on me,
Fulfil Thy blest design,
Till others see upon me
That beauteous face of Thine."}
