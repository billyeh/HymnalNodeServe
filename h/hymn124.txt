He has won the victory!
Sin is judged, old Adam finished
Full redemption now we see!
Vanquished all the evil powers,
Thru the Cross triumphantly!",
"2": "Praise Him! Christ is resurrected!
God hath raised Him from the dead!
All the pow'r of death is swallowed
Man from death to life is led!
Broken through are hell and darkness,
And His pow'r exhibited!",
"3": "Praise Him' Christ hath now ascended!
God hath raised Him to the throne!
Far above all rule and power
He the highest Name doth own!
All authority receiving,
Till His foe is overthrown!",
"4": "Hallelujah, Christ the Victor,
Triumphed on Mt. Calvary!
Hallelujah, resurrected
He displays His victory!
Hallelujah, now ascended
He shall reign eternallY!"}
