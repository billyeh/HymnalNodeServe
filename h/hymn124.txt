["1 Praise Him! praise Him! Christ is Victor!\nHe has won the victory!\nSin is judged, old Adam finished\nFull redemption now we see!\nVanquished all the evil powers,\nThru the Cross triumphantly!", "2 Praise Him! Christ is resurrected!\nGod hath raised Him from the dead!\nAll the pow'r of death is swallowed\nMan from death to life is led!\nBroken through are hell and darkness,\nAnd His pow'r exhibited!", "3 Praise Him' Christ hath now ascended!\nGod hath raised Him to the throne!\nFar above all rule and power\nHe the highest Name doth own!\nAll authority receiving,\nTill His foe is overthrown!", "4 Hallelujah, Christ the Victor,\nTriumphed on Mt. Calvary!\nHallelujah, resurrected\nHe displays His victory!\nHallelujah, now ascended\nHe shall reign eternallY!"]
