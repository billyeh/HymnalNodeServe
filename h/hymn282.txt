{"1": "Lord of light, with light divine,
Shine upon this heart of mine;
Chase the shades of night away,
Turn the darkness into day.",
"2": "Lord of power, with power divine,
Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
Long has sin without control
Held dominion o'er my soul.",
"3": "Lord of joy, with joy divine,
Cheer this saddened heart of mine;
Bid my many woes depart,
Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.",
"4": "Lord, the Spirit, all divine,
Dwell within this heart of mine;
Cast down every idol throne,
Reign supreme, and reign alone."}
