{"1": "The Church's seed is nought but Christ Himself,
Sown into human hearts as life, thereby,
Growing as wheat, producing flour fine,
For bread both God and man to satisfy.",
"2": "But Satan hath the false believers sown,
Among the saints as tares among the wheat
To bring confusion and to hinder growth,
That they may not fulfill God's plan complete.",
"3": "The Church's life just as the herb must be
Grown out of Christ, who is the mustard seed;
Hidden and transient, little on the earth
But good for food the hungry ones to feed.",
"4": "But Satan came and made the little herb,
To change its nature and to change its form
That fully grown it did a tree become,
Where many evil ones may lodge and swarm.",
"5": "Satan has also used the fallen "church"
Evil and heathen practice to include
As leaven mingled with the meal of wheat
Thus to corrupt its purity as food.",
"6": "But Christ as life would so transform the saints,
That they may be as pearl and precious stone
As the materials suitable to build,
Into His Church to make His Kingdom known.",
"7": "Such an assembly grown in Christ as life
Transformed and built with Christ in them annealed
Is as the goodly pearl for preciousness,
And as the treasure hidden in the field.",
"8": "Lord, separate us from the devil's "tares,
Each one deliver from the monstrous "tree,
From all the "leaven" may Thou purify
That we may be as food to man and Thee.",
"9": "Cause us to grow in life divine each day,
That we may be transformed and built by Thee,
Into a body to express Thyself
That Thou in us Thy Church and Kingdom see."}
