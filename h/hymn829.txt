["1 The Church's seed is nought but Christ Himself,\nSown into human hearts as life, thereby,\nGrowing as wheat, producing flour fine,\nFor bread both God and man to satisfy.", "2 But Satan hath the false believers sown,\nAmong the saints as tares among the wheat\nTo bring confusion and to hinder growth,\nThat they may not fulfill God's plan complete.", "3 The Church's life just as the herb must be\nGrown out of Christ, who is the mustard seed;\nHidden and transient, little on the earth\nBut good for food the hungry ones to feed.", "4 But Satan came and made the little herb,\nTo change its nature and to change its form\nThat fully grown it did a tree become,\nWhere many evil ones may lodge and swarm.", "5 Satan has also used the fallen \"church\"\nEvil and heathen practice to include\nAs leaven mingled with the meal of wheat\nThus to corrupt its purity as food.", "6 But Christ as life would so transform the saints,\nThat they may be as pearl and precious stone\nAs the materials suitable to build,\nInto His Church to make His Kingdom known.", "7 Such an assembly grown in Christ as life\nTransformed and built with Christ in them annealed\nIs as the goodly pearl for preciousness,\nAnd as the treasure hidden in the field.", "8 Lord, separate us from the devil's \"tares,\nEach one deliver from the monstrous \"tree,\nFrom all the \"leaven\" may Thou purify\nThat we may be as food to man and Thee.", "9 Cause us to grow in life divine each day,\nThat we may be transformed and built by Thee,\nInto a body to express Thyself\nThat Thou in us Thy Church and Kingdom see."]
