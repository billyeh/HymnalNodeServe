{"1": "I can hear my Savior calling,
In the tend'rest accents calling;
On my ear these words are falling,
"Take thy cross, and daily follow me."",
"chorus": "I will take my cross and follow,
My dear Savior I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.",
"2": "Though the way be dark and dreary,
Though my feet be worn and weary,
Yet my heart keeps bright and cheery
As I follow, follow all the way.",
"3": "Savior, ever go before me,
Shining heaven's sunlight o'er me,
And when weak, by grace restore me
As I follow, follow all the way.",
"4": "Through the valley safely lead me,
Heav'nly manna daily feed me;
Every hour, dear Lord, I need Thee
As I follow, follow all the way.",
"5": "In Thy heart's affection hold me,
In Thy arms of love enfold me,
And with Thine own grace uphold me,
As I follow, follow all the way.",
"6": "I would never leave Thee, never;
Faithful I would be forever;
Nothing from Thy love can sever
As I follow, follow all the way."}
