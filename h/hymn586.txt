["1 I can hear my Savior calling,\nIn the tend'rest accents calling;\nOn my ear these words are falling,\n\"Take thy cross, and daily follow me.\"", "chorus I will take my cross and follow,\nMy dear Savior I will follow,\nWhere He leads me I will follow,\nI'll go with Him, with Him all the way.", "2 Though the way be dark and dreary,\nThough my feet be worn and weary,\nYet my heart keeps bright and cheery\nAs I follow, follow all the way.", "3 Savior, ever go before me,\nShining heaven's sunlight o'er me,\nAnd when weak, by grace restore me\nAs I follow, follow all the way.", "4 Through the valley safely lead me,\nHeav'nly manna daily feed me;\nEvery hour, dear Lord, I need Thee\nAs I follow, follow all the way.", "5 In Thy heart's affection hold me,\nIn Thy arms of love enfold me,\nAnd with Thine own grace uphold me,\nAs I follow, follow all the way.", "6 I would never leave Thee, never;\nFaithful I would be forever;\nNothing from Thy love can sever\nAs I follow, follow all the way."]
