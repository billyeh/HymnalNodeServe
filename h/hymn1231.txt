{"1": "O praise the Lord, God has a plan-
That's why He formed a man;
To exercise authority,
Subdue the earth entirely.
O what a joy to be
In His recovery,
O praise God He made me a V.I.P.",
"2": "O hallelujah, Christ became
A man to die for me.
And dying once my life to be,
In spirit now He lives in me.
The man supreme is He,
My all He came to be;
O hallelujah, He lives in me!",
"3": "O hallelujah, I'm a man,
The center of God's plan.
I'm God's own image made to be,
Expressing His authority.
It's great to be a man,
O praise God, I'm a man,
O hallelujah, I am a man!",
"4": "O hallelujah, one new man,
The building of God's plan!
God's plan throughout eternity-
Not man, but men built corporately.
This man cannot be beat,
All things beneath his feet,
Christ and the church one man complete."}
