{"1": "Lord, speak Thy Word, upon us breathe;
Behold, dry bones fill all the earth,
In graves and scattered 'round in death;
Lord, speak and breathe upon us!",
"2": "Lord, speak Thy Word, upon us breathe
Revive the bones with quickening breath
That we may leave our graves, our death;
Lord, speak and breathe upon us!",
"3": "Lord, speak Thy Word, upon us breathe
Thy people all to make alive
A mighty host, the foe to drive;
Lord, speak and breathe upon us!",
"4": "Lord, speak Thy Word, upon us breathe
That all Thy people may be one
Led by the headship of the Son;
Lord, speak and breathe upon us!",
"5": "Lord, speak Thy Word, upon us breathe
Thy people fitly frame with grace,
To be Thy rest, Thy dwelling-place;
Lord, speak and breathe upon us!",
"6": "Lord, speak to me, upon me breathe
Revive me, in Thy Body build
No more secluded and self-willed;
Breathe now, O Lord, upon me!",
"7": "Lord, speak to me, upon me breathe,
That with Thy saints the foe I'll fight
That in Thy house Thou may delight
Breathe now, O Lord, upon me!"}
