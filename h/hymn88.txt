["1 How beauteous were the marks divine,\nThat in Thy meekness used to shine,\nThat lit Thy lonely pathway, trod\nIn wondrous love, O Son of God!", "2 O who like Thee, so mild, so bright,\nThou Son of man, Thou Light of light?\nO who like Thee did ever go\nSo patient, through a world of woe?", "3 O who like Thee so humbly bore\nThe scorn, the scoffs of men, before?\nSo meek, so lowly, yet so high,\nSo glorious in humility?", "4 And death, that sets the prisoner free,\nWas pang, and scoff, and scorn to Thee;\nYet love through all Thy torture glowed,\nAnd mercy with Thy life-blood flowed.", "5 O wondrous Lord, my soul would be\nStill more and more conformed to Thee,\nAnd learn of Thee, the lowly One,\nAnd like Thee, all my journey run."]
