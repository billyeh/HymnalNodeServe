{"1": "With praise and thanksgiving
There stands a great throng
In the presence of Jesus
And sing this new song.",
"chorus": "Unto Him Who hath loved us
And washed us from sin,
Unto Him be the glory forever!
Amen!",
"2": "All these once were sinners,
Defiled in His sight,
Now arrayed in pure garments,
In praise they unite.",
"3": "He maketh the rebel
A priest and a king,
He hath bought us, and taught us
This new song to sing.",
"4": "How helpless and hopeless
We sinners had been,
If He never had loved us till
Cleansed from our sin.",
"5": "Aloud in His praises
Our voices shall ring,
So that others, believing,
This new song shall sing."}
