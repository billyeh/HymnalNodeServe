{"1": "How all-inclusive, Lord, Thou art;
Of God we are in Thee-
The portion God prepared for us
Our all in all to be.",
"2": "Thou art to us God's wisdom true
We all are saved through Thee;
Thou art God's only way to save
Thou art our only plea.",
"3": "Thou art to us our righteousness
All God requires to meet;
In Thee we all are justified
In Thee we are complete.",
"4": "Thou art to us our holiness,
That we may be transformed;
In Thee we all are sanctified
To Thee we'll be conformed.",
"5": "Thou art to us redemption too
That we Thy likeness bear;
Transfigured will our bodies be,
Thy liberty to share.",
"6": "Dear Lord, while we remember Thee
Enjoying all Thou art
We thus would hasten Thy return,
And ne'er from Thee depart.",
"7": "How sweet to have this foretaste here
A taste so wonderful
Yet still we fain would be with Thee
And share Thyself in full."}
