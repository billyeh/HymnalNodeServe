["1 Jesus, Redeemer and my one Inspirer,\nHeat in my coldness, set my life aglow.\nBreak down my barriers; draw, yea, draw me nigher.\nThee would I know, whom it is life to know.", "2 Deepen me, rid me of the superficial;\nFrom pale delusion set my spirit free;\nAll the entangled in me quick unravel;\nPluck forth each thread of insincerity.", "3 Thy vows are on me, oh to serve Thee truly\nLove perfectly, in purity obey-\nBurn, burn, O Fire, O Wind, now winnow throughly;\nO Sword, awake against the flesh and slay."]
