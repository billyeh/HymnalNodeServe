{"1": "God in His justifying has a plan,
A deeper purpose for a corporate man.
When we were called, this mighty Lord of all
Appeared to us to save us from the fall.",
"2": "We walked as strangers unaware of Him,
But in His glory God shined deep within,
Infusing His own element in us;
This precious essence was our Lord Jesus.",
"3": "What glory! How attractive was this light!
How we appreciated such a sight!
Our first reaction was belief in Him-
This precious God has placed Himself within.",
"4": "Our first reflection of this element
Reflected Jesus back to God, Who sent
His own response to count as righteousness
Our faith in Him Who was infused in us.",
"5": "But we would hold to this reality,
Our Jesus Christ in us our all to be,
Enjoying all He is abundantly,
Content to have this One eternally.",
"6": "Thus God could never be so satisfied;
Knowing that we cared only to abide
In our experiences of His Son,
Not caring for His goal to make us one.",
"7": "Still He would seek those faithful saints who'd hear
His call to give up everything so dear,
To offer up their individual Christ;
To come together for the Body life."}
