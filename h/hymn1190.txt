{"1": "O Lord, You've called to us, and Canaan we would win,
To be Your corporate man and dwell with You therein;
But how the darkness of this world does hold us in-
O Lord, appear to us, we pray.",
"chorus": "O Lord, appear to us today;
We see this is the only way.
The idols to forsake
And Canaan land partake,
O Lord, appear to us today.",
"2": "O God of glory, shine; draw and we'll follow You.
Our strength and motive be, it's nothing we could do.
Your light attracts us, Lord, 'til all else fades from view-
O Lord, do shine on us, we pray.",
"chorus": "O Lord, do shine on us today;
Till all our background fades away,
Till You alone we see,
Shining so gloriously-
O Lord, do shine on us today.",
"3": "In Your appearing, Lord, we have Your speaking clear;
Your word empowers us and drives away all fear.
So, Lord, keep calling us, Your voice we need to hear.
O Lord, do speak to us, we pray.",
"chorus": "O Lord, do speak in us today;
You know the words You need to say.
To open all our heart,
Your very Self impart.
O Lord, do speak in us today.",
"4": "O Lord, it's not of us, we've seen it's all of You;
You are the calling One, Originator too!
We can receive this call by our beholding You-
O God of glory, come, we pray.",
"chorus": "O God of glory, come today;
We've seen this is the only way
To answer Your dear call
That You might be our all-
O God of glory, come today."}
