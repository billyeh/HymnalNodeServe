["1 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;\nLet me Thy glory see,\nDraw my soul close to Thee,\nThen speak in love to me-Nothing between.", "2 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;\nLet not earth's din and noise\nStifle Thy still small voice;\nIn it let me rejoice-Nothing between.", "3 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;\nNothing of earthly care,\nNothing of tear or prayer,\nNo robe that self may wear-Nothing between.", "4 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;\nUnbelief disappear,\nVanish each doubt and fear,\nFading when Thou art near-Nothing between.", "5 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;\nShine with unclouded ray,\nChasing each mist away,\nO'er my whole heart bear sway-Nothing between.", "6 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;\nThus may I walk with Thee,\nThee only may I see,\nThine only let me be-Nothing between.", "7 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;\nTill Thine eternal light,\nRising on earth's dark night,\nBursts on my open sight-Nothing between."]
