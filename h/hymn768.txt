{"1": "Lord, teach us to use
The intercessor's rod,
As Moses did of old
Upon the hill of God.",
"2": "Before the upstayed arm
The ranks of darkness quailed!
In great Jehovah's Name
The hosts of light prevailed!",
"3": "Teach us to bind the foe
With iron chains of prayer,
That all Thy Church may move
To victory everywhere.",
"4": "Give us the steady arm,
Until the sun go down,
That we in Christ may win
The overcomer's crown."}
