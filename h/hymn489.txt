["1 Oh, Jesus, Lord, when Thou on earth,\nAccompanied Thy faithful band\nIt seemed they knew, but knew Thee not\nThyself they did not understand.", "2 They heard Thy voice, beheld Thy form\nThy beauteous stature unforgot;\nThey crowded 'round Thee, met Thy gaze\nBut who Thou art, they knew it not.", "3 As they of old we too are veiled;\nWe've known Thee long apparently;\nYet if we say we know, at best,\nWe know Thee not transparently.", "4 But as the Spirit now Thou art\nAnother Comforter become;\nReveal Thyself within my heart\nSince to Thy temple Thou hast come.", "5 With Thy blest Spirit, Lord, fill me\nFill every corner of my soul;\nMay Thou inspire my every part\nOh may Thou touch, renew the whole.", "6 The Spirit then revealing make,\nThyself more real within my heart\nThat ear not hear, nor eye may see,\nHow very real to me Thou art.", "7 When Thou in mercy dost reveal,\nAnd give Thyself as Spirit thus\nWhat in the world can be more real\nMore true than what Thou art to us?", "8 Thy Spirit, Lord, in mine, I pray\nO'erflow my being as a flood\nThat every part with glory shine,\nAnd everywhere be Thee and God.", "9 How close we are in such a life\nIn one is blended earth with heav'n;\nThy presence sweetly fills our souls;\nOur hearts are to Thy praises giv'n."]
