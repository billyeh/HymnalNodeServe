Jesus my Savior salvation affords;
Gives me His Spirit a witness within,
Whisp'ring of pardon, and saving from sin.",

Saved, saved by power divine;
Saved, saved, I'm saved to the uttermost;
Jesus the Savior is mine!",

Keeping me safely, He casteth out fear;
Trusting His promises, how I am blest;
Leaning upon Him, how sweet is my rest.",

"Once all was darkness, but now it is day."
Beautiful visions of glory I see;
Jesus in brightness revealed unto me.",

Loud hallelujahs to Jesus my King!
Ransomed and pardoned, redeemed by His blood,
Cleansed from unrighteousness, glory to God!"}
