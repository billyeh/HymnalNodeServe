{"1": "The Spirit of the triune God,
Within our spirit now doth rest;
He ever seeks thru us to flow
That God in Christ may be expressed.",
"2": "But by the outward, natural man,
The Spirit is confined within;
Instead of giving Him a home
A prison we've become to Him.",
"3": "He's like a treasure of great worth,
Contained in vessels earthen-made;
The vessel must be broken through,
And thus the treasure be displayed.",
"4": "Oh, how the Lord our self must break
Our outward man does so impede!
It must be broken thoroughly
And thus the Spirit will be freed.",
"5": "This is the reason why the Lord,
For us a certain measure makes,
Of circumstantial suffering;
'Tis thus our outward man He breaks.",
"6": "The outward man, the self, the soul
Must be consumed, must be decreased;
The inner man, our spirit, then,
Shall with the Spirit be released.",
"7": "Lord, grant Thy holy brokenness
Deliver me from being whole;
And make me willing to receive,
The wounds that Thou wouldst give my soul.",
"8": "Oh, cause me to appreciate,
Thy breaking, never to complain;
And grant that I may value more,
All kinds of loss instead of gain."}
