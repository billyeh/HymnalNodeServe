["1 Why should I fear the darkest hour,\nOr tremble at the tempter's power?\nJesus vouchsafes to be my tower.", "2 Though hot the fight, why quit the field?\nWhy must I either fly or yield,\nSince Jesus is my mighty shield?", "3 When creature comforts fade and die,\nWorldlings may weep, but why should I?\nJesus still lives, and still is nigh.", "4 Though all the flocks and herds were dead,\nMy soul a famine need not dread,\nFor Jesus is my living bread.", "5 I know not what may soon betide,\nOr how my wants shall be supplied;\nBut Jesus knows, and will provide.", "6 Though sin would fill me with distress,\nThe throne of grace I dare address,\nFor Jesus is my righteousness.", "7 Though faint my prayers and cold my love,\nMy steadfast hope shall not remove,\nWhile Jesus intercedes above.", "8 Against me earth and hell combine;\nBut on my side is power divine;\nJesus is all, and He is mine!"]
