{"1": "Thou art the Rock everlasting
Spiritual Rock cleft for me;
Drinking of Thee as the Spirit
Thus I become one with Thee.
Thou art the Rock never shaken
'Tis on this Rock we are built;
Joined unto Thee thru redemption
Nothing can shake us thru guilt.",
"chorus": "Lord, how we treasure Thy value
All that Thou art is for us;
While here in loving remembrance,
We share Thy wealth glorious.",
"2": "Thou art the Stone tried by many
Precious to God, dear to us
Thou art so sure and trustworthy
Thy strength is so marvelous.
Thou art the Stone that is living
Chosen of God, made our own;
So energetic and pow'rful
With endless life to us known.",
"3": "Thou art the Stone of Foundation,
Laid by our God, safe and sure;
It is by this sure foundation,
Safety fore'er we secure.
To us no other foundation,
Of any kind man can lay;
Thou art the only foundation,
Which we have now and for aye.",
"4": "Lord, for God's spiritual building
Thou art the Chief Cornerstone;
Both of the Jews and the Gentiles,
By Thee are built into one.
Lord, Thou art also the Topstone
Brought forth in measureless grace;
Thou art our cover and glory
Moving our hearts in Thy praise."}
