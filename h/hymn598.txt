["1 All fair within those children of the light,\nThough dark their brows beneath the desert sun;\nMysterious joys, far hidden from all sight,\nThe King of Glory giveth to each one;\nNo thought of man has pictured them,\nNo hand may touch that diadem;\nWithin God's light His own abide\nWith hidden glory glorified.", "2 To earthly eyes they are as Adam's race-\nThey wear the earthly form, and scars of pain\nOn them as on all sinners leave their trace;\nTheir outward needs are those of other men.\nAnd theirs the forms of earthly life,\nTheirs sleeping, waking, want, and strife,\nYet this they have that they despise\nWhat fairest seems to earthly eyes.", "3 And inwardly their life is from above,\nThe Lord's Almighty Word hath quickened them;\nFlames kindled from the everlasting Love,\nThe children of the New Jerusalem;\nTheir brethren are the saints in light,\nAnd songs of sweetness infinite\nThey sing with them to God Most High,\nA deep and wondrous melody.", "4 They walk upon the earth, and dwell in heaven,\nThough pow'rless, guard the world with arms unseen;\nDeep peace to them in midst of strife is given,\nAnd all they wish they have, though poor and mean.\nStorms beat them, but may not destroy,\nFast rooted in eternal joy;\nThey walk as in the shade of death,\nYet living on in silent faith.", "5 When Christ their Life shall be made manifest,\nWhen He shall come with all His pow'r to rule,\nTheir glory, hidden long, shall be confessed;\nArise and shine! O bright and beautiful!\nWith Christ ye shall ascend on high,\nVictorious in His victory-\nThe hidden light shall shine afar,\nEach saint an everlasting star."]
