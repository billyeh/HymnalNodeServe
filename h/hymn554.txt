["1 I come to His presence afresh,\nEre the night has passed into morning;\nAnd His face I see as it shines on me-\nThe Lord within is dawning.\nAnd He speaks to me and reveals to me,\nAll His riches for me today;\nAnd with sweet delight I partake of Him\nMy hunger has passed away.", "2 As Spirit He speaks thru the Word,\nTill my heart in echo is singing\nAnd the fount of life with His grace and pow'r,\nWithin my soul is springing.\nAnd He speaks to me and reveals to me,\nAll His riches for me today;\nAnd I drink of Him for my every need\nMy thirsting has passed away.", "3 In tenderness He deals with me\nWhile I stay with joy in His presence;\nAnd He saturates and supplies my soul,\nWith all His precious essence.\nAnd He speaks to me and reveals to me,\nAll His riches for me today;\nAnd in every way I partake of Him\nMy problems all passed away."]
