["1 Teach me Thy way, O Lord,\nTeach me Thy way;\nThy gracious aid afford,\nTeach me Thy way.\nHelp me to walk aright;\nMore by faith, less by sight;\nLead me with heav'nly light,\nTeach me Thy way.", "2 When doubts and fears arise,\nTeach me Thy way;\nWhen storms o'erspread the skies,\nTeach me Thy way.\nShine through the cloud and rain,\nThrough sorrow, toil, and pain;\nMake Thou my pathway plain,\nTeach me Thy way.", "3 Long as my life shall last,\nTeach me Thy way;\nWhere'er my lot be cast,\nTeach me Thy way.\nUntil the race is run,\nUntil the journey's done,\nUntil the crown is won,\nTeach me Thy way."]
