{"1": "What is living all about,
Where's the answer? Let's find out!
Call, "Lord Jesus!" Taste and see!
Christ becomes reality,
Life He gives abundantly
As a river flowing free.
With a new life we begin,
Joy is springing from within,
Love-He fills us to the brim!
And it's all because of Him! (Hallelujah)"}
