{"1": "Seek ye first, not earthly pleasure,
Fading joy and failing treasure,
But the love that knows no measure
Seek ye first.",
"2": "Seek ye first, not earth's aspirings,
Ceaseless longings, vain desirings,
But your precious soul's requirings
Seek ye first.",
"3": "Seek ye first God's peace and blessing;
Ye have all if this possessing;
Come, your need and sin confessing,
Seek Him first.",
"4": "Seek Him first, then when forgiven,
Pardoned, with the peace of heaven,
Let your life to Him be given:
Seek this first.",
"5": "Seek this first-Be pure and holy;
Like the Master, meek and lowly;
Yielded to His service wholly:
Seek this first.",
"6": "Seek the coming of His kingdom;
Seek the souls around to win them,
Seek to Jesus Christ to bring them:
Seek this first.",
"7": "Seek this first, His promise trying;
It is sure, all need supplying.
Heavenly things, on Him relying,
Seek ye first."}
