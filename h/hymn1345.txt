["1 Whenever the heart shall turn to the Lord,\nThe veil shall be taken away.\nSo turn your heart to the Lord all the day,\nAnd the veil shall be taken away.\nNow the Lord is that Spirit,\nAnd where the Spirit of the Lord is,\nThere is liberty-such liberty!\nWhenever the heart shall turn to the Lord,\nThe veil shall be taken away."]
