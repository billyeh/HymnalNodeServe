["1 Jesus, the very thought of Thee\nWith sweetness fills my breast;\nBut sweeter far Thy face to see,\nAnd in Thy presence rest.", "2 Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,\nNor can the memory find\nA sweeter sound than Thy blest Name,\nO Savior of mankind!", "3 O Hope of every contrite heart,\nO Joy of all the meek,\nTo those who fall, how kind Thou art!\nHow good to those who seek!", "4 But what to those who find? Ah, this\nNor tongue nor pen can show;\nThe love of Jesus, what it is\nNone but His loved ones know.", "5 O Jesus! light of all below!\nThou fount of life and fire!\nSurpassing all the joys we know,\nAnd all we can desire.", "6 No other source have we but Thee,\nSoul-thirst to satisfy.\nExhaustless spring! the waters free!\nAll other streams are dry.", "7 Jesus, our only Joy be Thou,\nAs Thou our Prize wilt be;\nJesus, be Thou our Glory now,\nAnd through eternity."]
