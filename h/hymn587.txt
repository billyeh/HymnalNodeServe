["1 'Tis so sweet to walk with Jesus,\nStep by step and day by day;\nStepping in His very footprints,\nWalking with Him all the way.", "chorus Step by step, step by step,\nI would walk with Jesus,\nAll the day, all the way,\nKeeping step with Jesus.", "2 'Tis so safe to walk with Jesus,\nLeaning hard upon His arm,\nFollowing closely where He leads us,\nNone can hurt and naught can harm.", "3 Step by step I'll walk with Jesus,\nJust a moment at a time,\nHeights I have not wings to soar to,\nStep by step my feet can climb.", "4 All the way I'll walk with Jesus,\nThrough the sunshine, through the gloom,\nThough His blood-marked steps may lead me\nTo the garden, to the tomb.", "5 Here a while we walk with Jesus,\nBut the time will not be long\nTill the night shall change to morning,\nAnd the sorrow into song.", "6 Then, with all who walked with Jesus,\nWe shall walk with Him in white,\nWhile He turns our grief to gladness,\nAnd our darkness into light.", "7 Jesus, keep me closer-closer,\nStep by step, and day by day;\nStepping in Thy very footprints,\nWalking with Thee all the way."]
