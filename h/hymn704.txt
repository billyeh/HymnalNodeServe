["1 Though troubles assail,\nAnd dangers affright;\nThough friends should all fail,\nAnd foes all unite,\nYet one thing secures us,\nWhatever betide:\nThe Scripture assures us,\n\"The Lord will provide.\"", "2 The birds, without barn\nOr storehouse, are fed;\nFrom them let us learn\nTo trust for our bread;\nHis saints what is fitting\nShall ne'er be denied,\nSo long as 'tis written,\n\"The Lord will provide.\"", "3 His call we obey,\nLike Abram of old,\nNot knowing our way,\nBut faith makes us bold;\nFor though we are strangers,\nWe have a good Guide;\nAnd trust in all dangers:\n\"The Lord will provide.\"", "4 When Satan appears\nTo stop up our path,\nAnd fills us with fears,\nWe triumph by faith;\nHe cannot take from us,\nThough oft he has tried,\nThe heart-cheering promise,\n\"The Lord will provide.\"", "5 He tells us we're weak,\nOur hope is in vain;\nThe good that we seek\nWe ne'er shall obtain;\nBut when such suggestions\nOur faith thus have tried,\nThis answers all questions,\n\"The Lord will provide.\"", "6 No strength of our own,\nNor goodness we claim;\nOur trust is all thrown\nOn Jesus' dear name.\nIn this our strong tower\nFor safety we hide;\nThe Lord is our power,\n\"The Lord will provide.\"", "7 When life sinks apace,\nAnd death is in view,\nThe word of His grace\nShall comfort us through;\nNot fearing or doubting,\nWith Christ on our side,\nWe hope to die shouting,\n\"The Lord will provide.\""]
