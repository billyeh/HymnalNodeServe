{"1": "Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son,
Endless is the vict'ry Thou o'er death hast won;
Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,
Kept the folded grave-clothes, where Thy body lay.",
"chorus": "Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son,
Endless is the vict'ry Thou o'er death hast won.",
"2": "Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb;
Lovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom;
Let the Church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing,
For her Lord now liveth, death hath lost its sting."}
