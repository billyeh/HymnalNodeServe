["1 I hear the words of love,\nI gaze upon the blood,\nI see the mighty sacrifice,\nAnd I have peace with God.", "2 'Tis everlasting peace!\nSure as Jehovah's Name,\n'Tis stable as His steadfast throne,\nFor evermore the same.", "3 The clouds may go and come,\nAnd storms may sweep my sky;\nThis blood-sealed friendship changes not,\nThe Cross is ever nigh.", "4 My love is ofttimes low,\nMy joy still ebbs and flows,\nBut peace with Him remains the same,\nNo change my Savior knows.", "5 I change, He changes not;\nThe Christ can never die;\nHis love, not mine, the resting-place,\nHis truth, not mine, the tie.", "6 The Cross still stands unchanged,\nThough heaven is now His home;\nThe mighty stone is rolled away,\nBut yonder is His tomb!", "7 And yonder is my peace,\nThe grave of all my woes!\nI know the Son of God has come,\nI know He died and rose.", "8 I know He liveth now\nAt God's right hand above;\nI know the throne on which He sits,\nI know His truth and love!"]
