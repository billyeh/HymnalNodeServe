Why thus in anguish pray?

There is a better way.",

O settle it all today;
O cease to doubt and struggle,
O cease to plead and pray;
O rest in His word forever,
And settle it all today.",

And trust Him though He slay;
Hush all thy fears and questions,
And settle it today.",

Upon His promise stay;
Cast out faith's strong sheet anchor,
And settle it today.",

To Thee commit my way;
I trust Thy word forever,
And settle it today."}
