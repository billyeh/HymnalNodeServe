["1 My old man has been crucified with Him,\nWith all its foul corruption deep within;\nAnd buried too its nature serpentine,\nCompletely finished-this great fact is mine,\nI hold it fast.", "2 But there's a Person in my spirit now,\nBorn as a babe so small, so weak, so low;\nWho by the Word's pure milk will grow to be\nThe overcoming inner man in me\nTo gain my heart.", "3 Christ as my Person must possess my heart\nAnd be preeminent in every part.\nThe former owner died but haunts it still.\nO Lord, move in; my mind, emotion, will\nNow welcome Thee.", "4 In spirit mingled, we are one, O Lord,\nThe human and divine in one accord;\nYet Thou must have a proper faculty\nThat all Thy glorious personality\nMay be expressed.", "5 So, Lord, I give my heart to Thee today,\nThat it may be Thy home in every way,\nA place for Thee to come and settle down,\nAnd all Thy grand recovery work to crown\nIn one new man."]
