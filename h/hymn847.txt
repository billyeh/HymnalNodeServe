That mingled with the saints I'll be
Long to be saved from independence,
And to be built with saints in Thee.",

That opened shall my spirit be
Long to be rescued from seclusion
And with the saints to worship Thee.",

Long that my spirit forth may come
Long to be saved from self-deception
And every hindrance overcome.",
"4": "I long for fellowship in spirit
With saints in spirit thus to pray
Long for deliv'rance from pretention
Long for true fellowship today.",

Long thus to know authority;
Long for true fellowship in service
Coordinated thus to be.",

Saints for such fellowship inspire
That we may realize Thy building,
And soon fulfill Thy heart's desire."}
