["1 When Noah worked upon the ark as God to him decreed.\nSo many others watched, yet to his words they gave no heed.\nBut Noah heard the voice of God and did His word obey;\nHis business was to build the ark; he couldn't waste a day.", "chorus Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see\nThe ark of testimony built in each locality.", "2 The generation at that time was evil and perverse;\nThe wickedness upon the earth was waxing worse and worse.\nBut Noah stood against the age and ne'er the vision lost.\nThe ark of testimony must be built at any cost.", "3 There were at that time many men who said they worshipped God;\nThey served Him and they sacrificed and yet 'twas very odd,\nThe very thing that God desired they mocked and ridiculed.\nTheir heart was set upon this age and by the devil ruled.", "4 One day the ark was finished and eight souls were led aboard.\nGod shut the door and then the heavens opened and outpoured.\nIt rained, but Noah took no thought for he was safe inside.\nWhen all the earth was flooded, he above it all did ride.", "5 The ark was just God's testimony on the earth that time.\nFor God had found a corporate man through whom His light could shine.\nHe needed something built through which He'd fully be expressed,\nAnd now it is the local church where God is manifest.", "6 Be careful lest this age would lead you from God's heart's desire.\nFor Jesus' testimony must set all our hearts afire.\nThe local churches are the ark, God's testimony true.\nFor this we leave the age behind and give our hearts anew."]
