["1 How sweet is the story of Christ's boundless love,\nThat brought Him to suffer from glory above!\nHe died in our stead upon Calvary's tree,\nObtaining redemption that we might be free.", "chorus Sound His praise! Sound His praise!\nAll the work has been done;\nPraise His name! Praise His name!\nJesus, God's blessed Son.\nWe give Him the glory, our Savior and Friend;\nOur song is of Jesus and never will end.", "2 How wondrous the story! the law's holy claims\nWere met by the blood which redemption proclaims.\nThe judgment of sin has been borne by the Son,\nWho glorified God in the work He has done.", "3 How brilliant the glory where Christ is enthroned\nHow rightly His name above others is owned!\nYes, Jesus, the Savior, the glory-crowned Lord,\nIs worthy by all to be ever adored."]
