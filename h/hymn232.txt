["1 By Christ redeemed, in Christ restored,\nWe keep the memory adored,\nAnd show the death of our dear Lord\nUntil He come.", "2 His body broken in our stead\nIs seen in this memorial bread,\nAnd so our feeble love is fed\nUntil He come.", "3 The drops of His dread agony,\nHis life-blood shed for us, we see;\nThe wine shall tell the mystery\nUntil He come.", "4 And thus that dark betrayal-night\nWith the last advent we unite,\nBy one blest chain of loving rite,\nUntil He come.", "5 Until the trump of God be heard,\nUntil the ancient graves be stirred,\nAnd with the great commanding word\nThe Lord shall come.", "6 O blessed hope! with this elate;\nLet not our heart be desolate,\nBut, strong in faith, in patience wait\nUntil He come."]
