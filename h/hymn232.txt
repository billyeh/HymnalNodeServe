{"1": "By Christ redeemed, in Christ restored,
We keep the memory adored,
And show the death of our dear Lord
Until He come.",
"2": "His body broken in our stead
Is seen in this memorial bread,
And so our feeble love is fed
Until He come.",
"3": "The drops of His dread agony,
His life-blood shed for us, we see;
The wine shall tell the mystery
Until He come.",
"4": "And thus that dark betrayal-night
With the last advent we unite,
By one blest chain of loving rite,
Until He come.",
"5": "Until the trump of God be heard,
Until the ancient graves be stirred,
And with the great commanding word
The Lord shall come.",
"6": "O blessed hope! with this elate;
Let not our heart be desolate,
But, strong in faith, in patience wait
Until He come."}
