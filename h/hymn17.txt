{"1": "My Father God, when on Thy vast creation
The wonders of the heav'n and earth, I gaze
Things great and small, beyond enumeration
Which manifest Thy pow'r in untold ways;",
"chorus": "Then all my being sings in praise to Thee
How marvellous! How great Thou art!
And this I'll sing through all eternity
How marvellous! How great Thou art!",
"2": "As I enjoy the grace of Thy salvation,
And contemplate how Thou Thy Son hast sent
Who died that we might be Thy new creation
Thy life expressing to the full extent;",
"3": "When in the church, in blest participation
I see how millions Thine own life possess
How they are built to form Thy habitation
Containing Thee, Thy fulness to express;",
"4": "As I expect the coming age of fulness,
And hope to share the new Jerusalem
With all the heavens and the earth in newness,
And all Thou art expressed in all of them;"}
