["1 O God our Father, we would come to Thee\nIn virtue of our Savior's precious blood;\nAll distance gone, our souls by grace set free,\nWe worship Thee, our Father and our God.", "2 We would, O God, present before Thy face\nThe fragrant name of Thy beloved Son;\nBy faith we view Him through Thy boundless grace,\nWhich, by His dying, He for us has won.", "3 Thy joy in Him who is with Thee we share;\nOur hearts delight in Thy delight in Him;\nChiefest of thousands, fairer than the fair;\nHis glory nought can tarnish, nought can dim.", "4 We bow in worship now before Thy throne,\nBy faith the Object of Thy love would see;\nWho, in the midst, His brethren's song doth lead.\nTo Him, our Savior, shall the glory be!"]
