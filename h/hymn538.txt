To have Christ revealed in me
Nothing outward as religion
But His Christ within to be.",

But Christ working inwardly.",

That His Christ be formed in me;
Not the outward forms to follow
But Christ growing inwardly.",
"4": "It is God's intent and pleasure,
That His Christ make home in me;
Not just outwardly to serve Him
But Christ dwelling inwardly.",

That His Christ my hope may be;
It is not objective glory
But 'tis Christ subjectively.",

That His Christ be all in me;
Nothing outwardly possessing
But His Christ eternally."}
