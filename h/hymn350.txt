["1 My goal is God Himself, not joy, nor peace,\nNor even blessing, but Himself, my God;\n'Tis His to lead me there-not mine, but His-\nAt any cost, dear Lord, by any road.", "2 So faith bounds forward to its goal in God,\nAnd love can trust her Lord to lead her there;\nUpheld by Him, my soul is following hard\nTill God hath full fulfilled my deepest prayer.", "3 No matter if the way be sometimes dark,\nNo matter though the cost be oft-times great,\nHe knoweth how I best shall reach the mark,\nThe way that leads to Him must needs be strait.", "4 One thing I know, I cannot say Him nay;\nOne thing I do, I press towards my Lord;\nMy God my glory here, from day to day,\nAnd in the glory there my great Reward."]
