["1 Since Thy departure from Olivet's Mountain\nWhy is Thy coming again so delayed?\nThru the long years we have longed for Thy coming;\nHast Thou not heard all the prayers that we've prayed?", "chorus Come Thou, come now;\nLord, for Thy coming we yearn;\nAll our desire is Thy promised returning\nOh, may Thou quickly return.", "2 Beloved Lord, since the year Thou ascended,\nEverything here has been tasteless and dry;\nOften in praying and often in watching\nIn every movement, for Thee, Lord, we sigh.", "3 Scenes although lovely, yet when will we meet Thee?\nBirds and the flowers fair beauty embrace;\nAll are delightsome, but none satisfy me\nFor I am longing for Thy loving face.", "4 Lord, we're impatient awaiting Thy coming\nWe do not know how much longer 'twill be;\nFrom every sunrise to every bright sunset,\nHope we each moment Thy coming to see.", "5 Whene'er 'tis raining, or strong winds are blowing\nWhene'er the moon shines, or rises the sea\nWe ever hope to discover Thy coming;\nHow disappointed when no sign of Thee!", "6 If it were not for the bidding Thou gav'st us\nWe'd be discouraged, Thy service we'd shirk;\nBut Thou dost want us while waiting Thy coming\nFor Thee to live and in diligence work.", "7 Oh Lord, remember the days have been lengthened,\nSince Thou hast promised ere going away;\nWe hope and hope and are endlessly hoping\nThat Thou wilt come. Canst Thou come e'en today?"]
