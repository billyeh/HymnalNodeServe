["1 Oh, sacred union with the Perfect Mind,\nTranscendent bliss which Thou alone canst give;\nHow blest are they this Peerless One who find,\nAnd, dead to earth, have learned in Thee to live.", "2 Thus in Thine arms of love, O Christ, I live,\nLost, and forever lost to all but Thee.\nMy happy soul, since it hath learned to die,\nHath found new life in Thine Infinity.", "3 Go, then, and learn this lesson of the Cross,\nAnd tread the way that saints and prophets trod:\nWho, counting life and self and all things loss,\nHave found in inward death the life of God."]
