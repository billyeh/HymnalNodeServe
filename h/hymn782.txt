{"1": "How mysterious, O Lord
That Thy Spirit dwells in mine;
O how marvelous it is
Into one, two spirits twine.",
"2": "By the spirit I can walk
Spiritual in spirit be;
By the spirit I can serve
And in spirit worship Thee.",
"3": "Thru Thy Word and by my prayer,
In the spirit touching Thee
Lifted high my spirit is
Strengthened shall my spirit be.",
"4": "Make my spirit strong I pray,
Others' spirits to revive;
Lift my spirit high and free
Others' spirits then may thrive.",
"5": "Every time I speak, O Lord
May my spirit actuate;
And whatever I may do
Let my spirit motivate.",
"6": "Every time my spirit acts,
Others' spirits opened be
Every time my spirit moves,
Others' lifted unto Thee.",
"7": "Lord, have mercy, from above,
May Thy Spirit breathe on me;
Then my spirit will be rich
Strengthened and refreshed by Thee."}
