{"1": "When I survey life's varied scene,
Amid the darkest hours
Sweet rays of comfort shine between
And thorns are mixed with flowers.",
"2": "Lord, teach me to adore Thy hand,
From whence my comforts flow,
And let me in this desert land
A glimpse of glory know.",
"3": "Father, whate'er of earthly bliss
Thy sovereign hand denies,
Accepted at Thy throne of grace,
Let this petition rise:",
"4": "Give me a calm, a thankful heart,
From every murmur free;
The blessings of Thy grace impart,
And let me live to Thee.",
"5": "Let the sweet hope that Thou art mine
My life and death attend,
Thy presence through my journey shine,
And crown my journey's end."}
