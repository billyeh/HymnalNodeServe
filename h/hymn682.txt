["1 When I survey life's varied scene,\nAmid the darkest hours\nSweet rays of comfort shine between\nAnd thorns are mixed with flowers.", "2 Lord, teach me to adore Thy hand,\nFrom whence my comforts flow,\nAnd let me in this desert land\nA glimpse of glory know.", "3 Father, whate'er of earthly bliss\nThy sovereign hand denies,\nAccepted at Thy throne of grace,\nLet this petition rise:", "4 Give me a calm, a thankful heart,\nFrom every murmur free;\nThe blessings of Thy grace impart,\nAnd let me live to Thee.", "5 Let the sweet hope that Thou art mine\nMy life and death attend,\nThy presence through my journey shine,\nAnd crown my journey's end."]
