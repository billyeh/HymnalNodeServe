{"1": "Lord, the ancient types and symbols,
As our all Thyself portrayed;
As was shadowed in those figures
Real to us Thou now art made.
Contemplating such a picture
As we on its wonders gaze
How we marvel at Thy riches,
And our song of worship raise.",
"2": "Lord, Thou art our true Passover
God passed over us thru Thee;
By Thyself and Thy redemption,
We with God have harmony.
Thou, the Lamb of God, redeemedst us,
With Thyself and with Thy blood;
We apply Thy blood, our ransom
Eating Thee, our real food.",
"3": "Lord, Thou art the Bread from heaven
The unleavened Bread of life;
Eating Thee, with Thee we mingle
Ceasing from our sin and strife.
Lamb and Bread are both Thy figures
Showing Thou art life to us;
Feasting on Thee at Thy table
We enjoy Thy riches thus.",
"4": "Lord, Thou art the Heav'nly Manna
As our daily food supply;
Strengthening and energizing
All our need to satisfy.
Living Rock Thou also art, Lord
Cleft for us with life to flow;
Drinking of this living water
Thirst is quenched, Thy life we know.",
"5": "Lord, Thou art the Land of Canaan-
Elevated, rich and good
Flowing with both milk and honey,
In a glorious plenitude.
By Thy surplus God we worship
In Thy fellowship we move;
Thus in love we're joined together,
And God's building we will prove."}
