{"1": "God's own Word must not be taken,
Just as knowledge but as life
Not alone God's thought conveying
But Himself to us as life;
Not alone God's mind revealing
But His Christ as life within
Not alone the teaching giving
But experience of Him.",
"2": "It is only knowledge to us,
If we in the letter read
But when reading in the spirit,
It is truly life indeed.
All the knowledge in the letter,
Only brings us into death
But the Word in spirit taken,
Gives to us the quickening breath.",
"3": "If we miss the Lord in Scripture
It is just as knowledge vain;
But when Christ we touch within it
Then His life we may obtain.
When we read, the Lord not touching
'Tis but mental stimulus;
But when Christ we touch by reading
It becometh life in us.",
"4": "All the knowledge of the Scriptures,
Into life must be transformed
All the mental understanding,
In the spirit must be formed;
All the Scriptural understanding,
Must become the life received
All the knowledge of the letters,
In the spirit be conceived.",
"5": "Just to touch the Word for knowledge,
Is to take the very way,
By which Eve was lured by Satan,
And by knowledge led astray;
But as life to take the Scripture,
Is the tree of life to eat;
Thus the Word we must be taking,
In the spirit as our meat."}
