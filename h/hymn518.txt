["1 Whom have I, Lord, in heav'n but Thee?\nNone but Thee! None but Thee!\nAnd this my song through life shall be:\nChrist for me! Christ for me!\nHe hath for me the serpent trod,\nHe hath redeemed me \"by His blood,\"\nAnd reconciled my soul to God:\nChrist for me! Christ for me!", "2 I envy not the rich their joys:\nChrist for me! Christ for me!\nI covet not earth's glitt'ring toys:\nChrist for me! Christ for me!\nEarth can no lasting bliss bestow,\n\"Fading\" is stamped on all below;\nMine is a joy no end can know:\nChrist for me! Christ for me!", "3 Though with the poor be cast my lot:\nChrist for me! Christ for me!\n\"He knoweth best,\" I murmur not:\nChrist for me! Christ for me!\nThough \"vine\" and \"fig-tree\" blight assail,\nThe \"labor of the olive fail,\"\nAnd death o'er flock and herd prevail,\nChrist for me! Christ for me!", "4 Though I am now on hostile ground,\nChrist for me! Christ for me!\nAnd sin beset me all around,\nChrist for me! Christ for me!\nLet earth her fiercest battles wage,\nAnd foes against my soul engage,\nStrong in His strength I scorn their rage:\nChrist for me! Christ for me!", "5 And when my life draws to its close,\nChrist for me! Christ for me!\nSafe in His arms I shall repose,\nChrist for me! Christ for me!\nWhen sharpest pains my frame pervade,\nAnd all the powers of nature fade,\nStill will I sing through death's cold shade;\nChrist for me! Christ for me!"]
