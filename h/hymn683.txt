["1 God holds the key of all unknown,\nAnd I am glad;\nIf other hands should hold the key,\nOr if He trusted it to me,\nI might be sad.", "2 What if tomorrow's cares were here,\nWithout its rest?\nI'd rather He unlocked the day,\nAnd, as the hours swing open, say,\nMy will is best.", "3 The very dimness of my sight\nMakes me secure;\nFor, groping in my misty way,\nI feel His hand; I hear Him say,\nMy help is sure.", "4 I cannot read His future plans;\nBut this I know:\nI have the smiling of His face,\nAnd all the refuge of His grace\nWhile here below.", "5 Enough; this covers all my wants;\nAnd so I rest;\nFor what I cannot, He can see,\nAnd in His care I saved shall be,\nForever blest."]
