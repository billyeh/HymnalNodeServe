["1 In the church the sound of life upon our ear is falling,\nThen we see the joy of Christ expressed on every hand;\nBabylon and things of earth in vain to us are calling.\nWe are home forever in Christ our land.", "chorus We're churching in the Spirit\nOn the church's local ground;\nWe're churching with our brothers,\nOur family we have found.\nOh, yes, we're churching with the churches,\nAnd we'll make the earth resound\nWith hallelujahs for Christ our land!", "2 Far away our background seems with all its gifts and teaching,\nFarther still, the worldly things with all their foul demand;\nAs the love of Jesus Christ our inmost heart isreaching,\nNot a thing can move us from Christ our land.", "3 \"I will build My church upon this rock,\" said the Lord Jesus,\nAnd we see the building of His purpose and His plan;\nSetting members in the Body as Himself it pleases,\nBuilding us together in Christ our land.", "4 Now the Lord's recovery is everywhere proceeding,\nAll the churches join in one to give the Lord command:\n\"Speed the day when all the earth will echo with pray-reading\nAnd with hallelujahs for Christ our land.\""]
