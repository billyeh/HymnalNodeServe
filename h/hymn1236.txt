{"1": "In the church the sound of life upon our ear is falling,
Then we see the joy of Christ expressed on every hand;
Babylon and things of earth in vain to us are calling.
We are home forever in Christ our land.",
"chorus": "We're churching in the Spirit
On the church's local ground;
We're churching with our brothers,
Our family we have found.
Oh, yes, we're churching with the churches,
And we'll make the earth resound
With hallelujahs for Christ our land!",
"2": "Far away our background seems with all its gifts and teaching,
Farther still, the worldly things with all their foul demand;
As the love of Jesus Christ our inmost heart isreaching,
Not a thing can move us from Christ our land.",
"3": ""I will build My church upon this rock," said the Lord Jesus,
And we see the building of His purpose and His plan;
Setting members in the Body as Himself it pleases,
Building us together in Christ our land.",
"4": "Now the Lord's recovery is everywhere proceeding,
All the churches join in one to give the Lord command:
"Speed the day when all the earth will echo with pray-reading
And with hallelujahs for Christ our land.""}
