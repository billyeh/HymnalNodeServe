{"1": "Thy blueprint, Lord, I treasure dear
It shows Thy tabernacle real
It tells how Thou wouldst have it built
How Thou Thy glory wouldst reveal.",
"2": "The ark's the center of the tent
The tent is but its resting-place:
In it the ten commandments are
And in the tent it ever stays.",
"3": "The ark the God-man, Christ, displays-
God mixed with man, as gold, wood meet;
The law is God's expression full
Which dwells in Christ the Son complete.",
"4": "Thus Christ's the center of the Church
Which is to Him a resting-place;
In Christ the Father ever dwells
And in the Church, Christ's dwelling-place.",
"5": "The tent's the increase of the ark
Both are of wood with gold o'erlaid;
The Church the increase is of Christ
God blent with man here too displayed.",
"6": "The boards when joined support the tent,
On silver sockets standing sure;
Gold overlaid, with golden rings,
And interlocking bars, secure.",
"7": "The Church is thus the gathered saints
On Christ's redemption standing sure;
In life divine, by Spirit bound
Together built and framed secure.",
"8": "The tent's four-layered cover shows,
The Christ of God in every phase;
God's glory thus is signified
Covering His holy dwelling-place.",
"9": "Covered by such a glorious Christ
All saints together knit may be;
Enjoying all He is for them
In Him they're builded gloriously.",
"10": "The law is placed within the ark
The ark within the tent doth rest;
So God in Christ within the Church,
His wondrous glory manifests."}
