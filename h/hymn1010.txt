["1 O now I see the cleansing wave!\nThe fountain deep and wide;\nJesus, my Lord, mighty to save,\nPoints to His wounded side.", "chorus The cleansing stream I see, I see;\nI plunge, and O it cleanseth me!\nO praise the Lord it cleanseth me!\nIt cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.", "2 I see the dear Redeemer raised,\nI hear the speaking blood;\nIt speaks! My spirit is amazed!\nAnd quickened by its flood.", "3 I rise to walk in God's own light\nAbove the world and sin,\nWith heart renewed and garments white\nAnd Christ enthroned within."]
