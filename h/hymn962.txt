["1 Oh, how long before my Lord comes back\nMy heart desires to see Thy face\nThat the song of triumph I may sing,\nAnd behold my Beloved, full of grace.\nCome quickly, Lord, and tarry not!\nOh, when wilt Thou return to comfort me;\nCome quickly, Lord, and tarry not!\nMy heart desires to be with Thee."]
