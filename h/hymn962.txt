{"1": "Oh, how long before my Lord comes back
My heart desires to see Thy face
That the song of triumph I may sing,
And behold my Beloved, full of grace.
Come quickly, Lord, and tarry not!
Oh, when wilt Thou return to comfort me;
Come quickly, Lord, and tarry not!
My heart desires to be with Thee."}
