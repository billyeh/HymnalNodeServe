{"1": "To Calv'ry let our eyes be turned,
With Calv'ry love our hearts be burned;
For there in Calv'ry's awful hour,
Love conquered sin and Satan's pow'r.",
"2": "Lord, turn our gaze upon Thy Cross,
Counting all else not gain but loss;
For this we pray, this is our plea-
Lord, keep our eyes on Calvary."}
