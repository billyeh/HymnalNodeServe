{"1": "River of living water
River that flows from the throne
Fellowship giving and making,
God's own authority known.",
"chorus": "River of living water
Fellowship freely bestows;
Bringing authority with it
Through every place where it flows.",
"2": "Water of life is the Spirit
God as the life in it flows;
Carrying with it His Lordship
Through every place where it goes.",
"3": "Midst the gold street it floweth
Thus showing to us the way;
As in God's nature it floweth
So in His way we will stay.",
"4": "The tree of life by the river
Shows to us God as our food;
We by the river's full flowing,
Take of the tree's plenitude."}
