["1 Once it was the blessing,\nNow it is the Lord;\nOnce it was the feeling,\nNow it is His Word;\nOnce His gift I wanted,\nNow, the Giver own;\nOnce I sought for healing,\nNow Himself alone.", "chorus All in all forever,\nOnly Christ I'll sing;\nEverything is in Christ,\nAnd Christ is everything.", "2 Once 'twas painful trying,\nNow 'tis perfect trust;\nOnce a half salvation,\nNow the uttermost;\nOnce 'twas ceaseless holding,\nNow He holds me fast;\nOnce 'twas constant drifting,\nNow my anchor's cast.", "3 Once 'twas busy planning,\nNow 'tis trustful prayer;\nOnce 'twas anxious caring,\nNow He has the care;\nOnce 'twas what I wanted,\nNow what Jesus says;\nOnce 'twas constant asking,\nNow 'tis ceaseless praise.", "4 Once it was my working,\nHis it hence shall be;\nOnce I tried to use Him,\nNow He uses me;\nOnce the pow'r I wanted,\nNow the Mighty One;\nOnce for self I labored,\nNow for Him alone.", "5 Once I hoped in Jesus,\nNow I know He's mine;\nOnce my lamps were dying,\nNow they brightly shine;\nOnce for death I waited,\nNow His coming hail;\nAnd my hopes are anchored\nSafe within the veil."]
