["1 On Thee my heart is resting,\nAh, this is rest indeed:\nWhat else, Almighty Savior,\nCan a poor sinner need?\nThy light is all my wisdom,\nThy love is all my stay;\nThy coming back in glory,\nDraws nearer every day.", "chorus On Thee my heart is resting,\nAh, this is rest indeed:\nWhat else, Almighty Savior,\nCan a poor sinner need?", "2 My guilt is great, but greater\nThe mercy Thou dost give;\nThyself, a spotless Off'ring,\nHast died that I should live.\nWith Thee, my soul unfettered\nHas risen from the dust;\nThy blood is all my treasure,\nThy word is all my trust.", "3 Through me, Thou gentle Master,\nThy purposes fulfil;\nI yield myself forever\nTo Thy most holy will.\nWhat though I be but weakness?\nMy strength is not in me;\nThe poorest of Thy people\nHas all things, having Thee.", "4 When clouds are darkest round me,\nThou, Lord, art then most near,\nMy drooping faith to quicken,\nMy weary soul to cheer.\nSafe nestling in Thy bosom,\nI gaze upon Thy face;\nIn vain my foes would drive me\nFrom Thee, my hiding-place.", "5 'Tis Thou hast made me happy,\n'Tis Thou hast set me free;\nTo whom shall I give glory\nForever, but to Thee?\nOf earthly love and blessing\nShould every stream run dry,\nThy grace shall still be with me,\nThy grace, to live and die."]
