{"1": "It was a garden in the primal age
But at the end it is a city square;
Creation's center in the garden was
God's building issues in the city fair.",
"2": "Both in the garden and the city fair,
A river and the tree of life are seen
Christ typifying as the life supply
The Spirit showing as the living stream.",
"3": "Both in the garden and the city bright,
Three kinds of precious substances are found;
There are the gold, the pearls, and precious stones,
Which for the building work of God abound.",
"4": "But in the garden all these precious things,
Are just materials lying in the earth
Yet in the city all are builded up,
And form that dwelling of transcendent worth.",
"5": "Man in the garden of the clay was formed
In nature as the Lord created him;
The tree of life was then without the man
Not having yet become his life within.",
"6": "But in the city glorious the tree,
Within the corporate "man" doth grow, thereby,
Revealing Christ Himself as life divine,
Being to man his inward life supply.",
"7": "'Tis for the city man is wrought upon
Therefore regenerated and transformed,
To purest gold, to pearls and precious stones
As Christ's own Body, to Himself conformed.",
"8": "Within the garden also was a bride
Who was to Adam as his counterpart;
Lastly, the city is itself the bride,
As Christ's own fulness, precious to His heart.",
"9": "The city is God's building work replete
A composition of the justified;
A habitation it affords to God,
And is to Christ His own beloved bride.",
"10": "'Tis God's expression, ultimate and full
Corporate and universal, marvelous;
God's glory it completely manifests
And is Christ's counterpart most glorious."}
