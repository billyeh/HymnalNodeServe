{"1": "Let me come closer to Thee, Lord Jesus,
Oh, closer day by day;
Let me lean harder on Thee, Lord Jesus,
Yes, harder, all the way.",
"2": "Let me show forth Thy beauty, Lord Jesus,
Like sunshine on the hills;
Oh, let my lips pour forth all Thy sweetness
In joyous sparkling rills.",
"3": "Yes, like a channel, precious Lord Jesus,
Make me and let me be;
Keep me and use me daily, Lord Jesus,
For Thee, for only Thee.",
"4": "In all my heart and will, O Lord Jesus,
Be altogether king;
Make me a loyal subject, Lord Jesus,
To Thee in everything.",
"5": "Thirsting and hungering for Thee, Lord Jesus,
With blessed hunger here.
Longing for New Jerusalem's fullness-
No thirst, no hunger there."}
