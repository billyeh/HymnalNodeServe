{"1": "Of the Spirit born in spirit
As the sons of God indeed
We possess the Holy Spirit
Dwelling in us for all need.
Yet we still need more of Him, Lord
That we may be full of Thee;
May Thou fill us with Thy Spirit
Give us life abundantly.",
"2": "Lord, we know the Spirit in us
But of life Thy Spirit is
That the riches of Thy fulness,
We may share thru what He is.
Yet we still require Thy Spirit,
As the power from on high
That for all Thy work and service
We may be equipped thereby.",
"3": "Lord, baptize us with Thy Spirit
Clothe us with Thy pow'r of might;
With this "mantle" of Thy power
We may then the battle fight.
May Thy wind now blow upon us
Giving us the tongues of fire
That, as witnesses anointed
We'll fulfill Thy heart's desire.",
"4": "With the power of Thy Spirit
Still we need the gifts to share
That as members we may function,
And Thy testimony bear.
By Thy Spirit's full outpouring
Lord, impart the gifts we need
That the building of Thy Body,
With Thy blessing might proceed.",
"5": "For Thy glory and Thy kingdom
May Thou hear Thy Body's cry!
Now fulfill Thy holy purpose
All our hunger satisfy.
May we all partake Thy Spirit
Him apply in many ways;
His infilling, His outpouring
And His gifts to share always."}
