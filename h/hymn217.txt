{"1": "On that night of nights most solemn,
Jesus called His own
'Round the table of remembrance,
All alone.",
"2": "Then this feast of feasts He ordered,
Feast of grace Divine;
Sacred symbols He appointed,
Bread and wine.",
"3": "Thus His death of deaths is shadowed
In this simple way,
Looking backward, pointing upward,
To that day.",
"4": "Till the morn of morns bright dawning,
Earth's dark shadows passed;
And the splendor of God's glory
Breaks at last.",
"5": "Thus the day of days shall open,
Deathless, cloudless, fair;
In that day, the Savior's glories
We shall share!"}
