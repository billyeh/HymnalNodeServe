{"1": "Lord Jesus, gladly do our lips express
Our heart's deep sense of all Thy worthiness;
Thou risen One, the Holy and the True,
We give Thee now the praise so justly due.",
"2": "Thou giv'st us, Lord, once more to taste down here
The joy Thy presence brings, its warmth and cheer;
With great delight we 'neath Thy shadow rest;
Thy fruit is sweet to those Thy love has blest.",
"3": "Thou wast alone, till like the precious grain
In death Thou layest, but didst rise again;
And in Thy risen life a countless host
Are "all of one" with Thee, Thy joy and boast."}
