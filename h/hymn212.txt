["1 Lord Jesus, gladly do our lips express\nOur heart's deep sense of all Thy worthiness;\nThou risen One, the Holy and the True,\nWe give Thee now the praise so justly due.", "2 Thou giv'st us, Lord, once more to taste down here\nThe joy Thy presence brings, its warmth and cheer;\nWith great delight we 'neath Thy shadow rest;\nThy fruit is sweet to those Thy love has blest.", "3 Thou wast alone, till like the precious grain\nIn death Thou layest, but didst rise again;\nAnd in Thy risen life a countless host\nAre \"all of one\" with Thee, Thy joy and boast."]
