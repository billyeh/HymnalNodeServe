["1 Glorious things of thee are spoken,\nHoly city of our God;\nHe whose word cannot be broken\nFormed thee for His own abode;\nOn the Rock of Ages founded,\nWhat can shake thy sure repose?\nWith salvation's walls surrounded,\nThou may'st smile at all thy foes.", "2 See the streams of living waters,\nSpringing from eternal love,\nWell supply thy blessed members,\nAnd all fear of want remove;\nWho can faint, when such a river\nEver flows their thirst t' assuage?\nGrace which, like the Lord, the giver,\nNever fails from age to age.", "3 Blest constituents of Zion,\nWashed in the Redeemer's blood;\nJesus, whom their souls rely on,\nMakes them kings and priests to God.\n'Tis His love His people raises\nOver self to reign as kings:\nAnd as priests, His worthy praises,\nEach his thankful offering brings.", "4 Savior, if of Zion's city\nI, through grace, a member am,\nLet the world deride or pity-\nI will glory in Thy name.\nFading is the worldling's pleasure,\nAll his boasted pomp and show;\nSolid joys and lasting treasure\nNone but Zion's members know."]
