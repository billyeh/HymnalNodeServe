["1 Jesus, my Savior! Thou art mine,\nThe Father's gift of love divine;\nAll Thou hast done, and all Thou art,\nAre now the portion of my heart.", "2 Poor, feeble, wretched, as I am,\nI now can glory in Thy name;\nNow cleansed in Thy most precious blood\nAnd made the righteousness of God.", "3 All that Thou hast Thou hast for me,\nAll my fresh springs are hid in Thee;\nIn Thee I live; while I confess\nI nothing am, yet all possess.", "4 O Savior, teach me to abide\nClose sheltered at Thy wounded side,\nEach hour receiving \"grace on grace,\"\nUntil I see Thee face to face."]
