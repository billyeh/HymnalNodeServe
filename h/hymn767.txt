["1 Teach us to pray that we may cause,\nThe enemy to flee\nThat we his evil pow'r may bind\nHis prisoners to free.", "2 Teach us to pray and firmly stand,\nUpon the battleground\nTo fight and break the stronghold down\nThe enemy confound.", "3 Teach us to pray and use Thy rod,\nIn strong, prevailing prayer\nBeneath Thy blood to shake the earth,\nAnd powers of the air.", "4 By prayer and faith, O may we learn,\nTo labor, Lord, with Thee\nTo know the victory is ours,\nAnd Thine authority."]
