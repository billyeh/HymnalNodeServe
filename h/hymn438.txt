["1 I've turned my back upon the world\nWith all its idle pleasures,\nAnd set my heart on better things,\nOn higher, holier treasures;\nNo more its glitter and its glare,\nAnd vanity shall blind me;\nI've crossed the separating line,\nAnd left the world behind me.", "chorus Far, far behind me!\nFar, far behind me!\nI've crossed the separating line,\nAnd left the world behind me.", "2 I've left the old sad life of sin,\nIts follies all forsaken;\nMy standing place is now in Christ,\nHis holy vows I've taken;\nBeneath the standard of the cross\nThe world henceforth shall find me;\nI've passed in Christ from death to life,\nAnd left the world behind me.", "chorus Far, far behind me!\nFar, far behind me!\nI've passed in Christ from death to life,\nAnd left the world behind me.", "3 My soul shall ne'er return again\nBack to its former station\nFor here alone is perfect peace,\nAnd rest from condemnation;\nI've made exchange of masters now,\nThe vows of glory bind me,\nAnd once for all I've left the world,\nYes, left the world behind me.", "chorus Far, far behind me!\nFar, far behind me!\nAnd once for all I've left the world,\nYes, left the world behind me.", "4 My choice is made forevermore,\nI want no other Savior;\nI ask no purer happiness\nThan His sweet love and favor;\nMy heart is fixed on Jesus Christ,\nNo more the world shall blind me;\nI've crossed the Red Sea of His death,\nAnd left the world behind me.", "chorus Far, far behind me!\nFar, far behind me!\nI've crossed the Red Sea of His death,\nAnd left the world behind me."]
