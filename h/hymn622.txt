["1 If we take up the cross, will we but suffer pain?\nNay, if we bear the cross, be sure that we will die!\nThe meaning of the cross is that we may be slain;\nThe cross experienced the self will crucify.", "2 Divine deliverance e'er slays man by the cross;\nThough cruel it may seem, it is a grand release.\nChrist ne'er will be our life if we escape the cross;\nChrist ne'er will be expressed but by our sure decease.", "3 The cross's final goal, that God's will be fulfilled;\nHis will's arch enemy is but the self of man.\nIf self be done away and all the soul-life killed\nGod's will shall then prevail and prospered be His plan."]
