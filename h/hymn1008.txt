["1 What can wash away my sin?\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\nWhat can make me whole again?\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.", "chorus Oh! precious is the flow\nThat makes me white as snow;\nNo other fount I know,\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.", "2 For my cleansing this I see-\nNothing but the blood of Jesus!\nFor my pardon this my plea-\nNothing but the blood of Jesus!", "3 Nothing can my sin erase\nNothing but the blood of Jesus!\nNaught of works, 'tis all of grace-\nNothing but the blood of Jesus!", "4 This is all my hope and peace-\nNothing but the blood of Jesus!\nThis is all my righteousness-\nNothing but the blood of Jesus!"]
