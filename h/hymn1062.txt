{"1": "I am coming to the cross;
I am poor, and weak, and blind;
I am counting all but dross;
I shall full salvation find.",
"chorus": "I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,
Blessed Lamb of Calvary;
Humbly at Thy cross I bow,
Save me, Jesus, save me now.",
"2": "Long my heart has sighed for Thee;
Long has evil dwelt within;
Jesus sweetly speaks to me,
"I will cleanse you from all sin.",
"3": "Here I give my all to Thee-
Friends and time and earthly store,
Soul and body Thine to be-
Wholly Thine forevermore.",
"4": "In the promises I trust;
Now I feel the blood applied;
I am prostrate in the dust;
I with Christ am crucified."}
