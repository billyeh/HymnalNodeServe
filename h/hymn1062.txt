["1 I am coming to the cross;\nI am poor, and weak, and blind;\nI am counting all but dross;\nI shall full salvation find.", "chorus I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,\nBlessed Lamb of Calvary;\nHumbly at Thy cross I bow,\nSave me, Jesus, save me now.", "2 Long my heart has sighed for Thee;\nLong has evil dwelt within;\nJesus sweetly speaks to me,\n\"I will cleanse you from all sin.", "3 Here I give my all to Thee-\nFriends and time and earthly store,\nSoul and body Thine to be-\nWholly Thine forevermore.", "4 In the promises I trust;\nNow I feel the blood applied;\nI am prostrate in the dust;\nI with Christ am crucified."]
