["1 O blessed Savior, is Thy love\nSo great! so full! so free!\nFain would we have our thoughts, our hearts,\nOur lives, engaged with Thee.", "2 We love Thee for the glorious worth\nWhich in Thyself we see;\nWe love Thee for that shameful cross,\nEndured so patiently.", "3 No man of greater love can boast\nThan for his friend to die;\nThou for Thine enemies wast slain!\nWhat love with Thine can vie?", "4 Though in the very form of God,\nWith heav'nly glory crowned,\nThou didst a servant's form assume,\nBeset with sorrow round.", "5 Thou wouldst like wretched man be made\nIn everything but sin,\nThat we as like Thee might become\nAs we unlike had been:", "6 Like Thee in strength, in meekness, love,\nIn life in ev'ry phase;\nFrom glory into glory changed,\nTill we behold Thy face.", "7 O Lord, we treasure in our hearts\nThe mem'ry of Thy love;\nAnd ever shall Thy name to us\nA grateful odor prove."]
