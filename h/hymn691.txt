["1 Hark! the voice of love and mercy\nSounds aloud from Calvary;\nSee, it rends the rocks asunder,\nShakes the earth, and veils the sky:\n\"It is finished!\" \"It is finished!\"\nHear the dying Savior cry.", "2 \"It is finished!\" Oh, what pleasure\nDo these charming words afford!\nHeavenly blessings without measure\nFlow to us from Christ, the Lord:\n\"It is finished!\" \"It is finished!\"\nSaints, the dying words record.", "3 Finished all the types and shadows\nOf the ceremonial law!\nFinished all that God had promised;\nDeath and hell no more shall awe:\n\"It is finished!\" \"It is finished!\"\nSaints, from hence your comfort draw.", "4 Tune your harps anew, ye seraphs,\nJoin to sing the pleasing theme;\nAll on earth and all in heaven\nJoin to praise Immanuel's name:\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nGlory to the bleeding Lamb!"]
