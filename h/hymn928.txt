["1 Is your life a channel of blessing?\nIs the love of God flowing through you?\nAre you telling the lost of the Savior?\nAre you ready His service to do?", "chorus Make me a channel of blessing today,\nMake me a channel of blessing, I pray;\nMy life possessing, my service blessing,\nMake me a channel of blessing today.", "2 Is your life a channel of blessing?\nAre you burdened for those that are lost?\nHave you urged upon those who are straying,\nThe Savior who died on the cross?", "3 We cannot be channels of blessing\nIf our lives are not free from all sin;\nWe will barriers be and a hindrance\nTo those we are trying to win."]
