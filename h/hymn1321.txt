["1 The grace which God bestows on us\nIs just His Son in full;\nThe rich enjoyment of this Christ\nIs plenteous, bountiful.\n'Tis far too great to comprehend,\nToo wondrous to contain:\nHow we, once children of despair,\nGod's masterpiece became.", "2 The whole creation now beneath\nThe weight of bondage sore,\nIn seeing God's sons manifest\nIs freed forevermore.\nTh' eternal purpose of our God\nWill be full manifest;\nThe hope of glory now concealed\nIs then to all expressed.", "3 The briars will be myrtle trees,\nThe thorn will be no more,\nAnd peace will reign where war did rage,\nThe curse will then be o'er.\n'Tis then the trees shall clap their hands,\nAnd all the hills shall sing;\nThis glorious freedom shall God's sons\nThus manifested bring.", "4 God's deepest work of grace goes on\nEach day, though hidden, small,\nUntil that day, when manifest,\nIt is revealed to all.\nBy then God's wrought His finished work:\nHimself dispensed to us;\nAnd all creation 'round admires\nHis product, glorious.", "5 The angels that before our God\nIn brightest splendor stand,\nWill join the universal praise\nTo Him for all He's planned.\nAnd of the devil, of his end . . . ?\nWe'll praise the Lord for how\nJust distant smoke is all that's left\nOf all that troubles now.", "6 So shall we not delight to give\nOurselves in every way,\nAnd let the Lord dispense Himself\nInto us more each day;\nThe grace that we receive each day,\nThough hidden oft, and small,\nIs God Himself wrought into us,\nThat day to shine o'er all."]
