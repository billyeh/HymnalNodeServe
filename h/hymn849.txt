{"1": "Holy priests are living stones,
For God's building work today;
If these stones would builded be,
All the priests must learn to pray.",
"chorus": "To the holiest often come
In the spirit touch the throne
Let the Lord flow thru in prayer
Thus the building work is done.",
"2": "All the saints must serve as priests
That the living stones they be;
Each must priestly work perform
Then their functions we will see.",
"3": "Tent and priests of olden times,
Always did together go;
When the priests served in the tent
Into one the two did flow.",
"4": "Now the building spiritual,
And the priesthood all are one;
Now the building of the house,
By the priestly work is done.",
"5": "In the priests the substance is,
Of the building work replete;
When the priests their work discharge
Then God's house will be complete.",
"6": "Building God and man in one,
Is their work before the Lord;
In this fellowship divine,
Saints are built in one accord.",
"7": "When in prayer our spirits blend
Then together built are we
Then a priesthood we become
Off'ring sacrifice to Thee.",
"8": "Grant us grace, O Lord, that we,
Treasure dear the priestly call;
In the spirit serve and pray
That Thy church be built withal."}
