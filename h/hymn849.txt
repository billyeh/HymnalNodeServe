["1 Holy priests are living stones,\nFor God's building work today;\nIf these stones would builded be,\nAll the priests must learn to pray.", "chorus To the holiest often come\nIn the spirit touch the throne\nLet the Lord flow thru in prayer\nThus the building work is done.", "2 All the saints must serve as priests\nThat the living stones they be;\nEach must priestly work perform\nThen their functions we will see.", "3 Tent and priests of olden times,\nAlways did together go;\nWhen the priests served in the tent\nInto one the two did flow.", "4 Now the building spiritual,\nAnd the priesthood all are one;\nNow the building of the house,\nBy the priestly work is done.", "5 In the priests the substance is,\nOf the building work replete;\nWhen the priests their work discharge\nThen God's house will be complete.", "6 Building God and man in one,\nIs their work before the Lord;\nIn this fellowship divine,\nSaints are built in one accord.", "7 When in prayer our spirits blend\nThen together built are we\nThen a priesthood we become\nOff'ring sacrifice to Thee.", "8 Grant us grace, O Lord, that we,\nTreasure dear the priestly call;\nIn the spirit serve and pray\nThat Thy church be built withal."]
