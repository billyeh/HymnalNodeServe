["1 The Lord will silently plan for thee,\nThou object of omniscient care;\nGod undertakes Himself to be\nThy Pilot through each subtle snare.", "2 The Lord will silently plan for thee,\nSo certainly, He cannot fail!\nRest on the faithfulness of God,\nIn Him thou surely shalt prevail.", "3 The Lord will silently plan for thee\nSome wonderful surprise of love.\nEye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard,\nBut it is kept for thee to prove.", "4 The Lord will silently plan for thee,\nHis purpose He'll to thee unfold;\nThe tangled skein shall shine at last,\nA masterpiece of skill untold.", "5 The Lord will silently plan for thee,\nA happy child kept in His care\nAs though no other claimed His love,\nBut thou alone to Him wert dear."]
