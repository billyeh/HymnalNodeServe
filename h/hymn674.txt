{"1": "The Lord will silently plan for thee,
Thou object of omniscient care;
God undertakes Himself to be
Thy Pilot through each subtle snare.",
"2": "The Lord will silently plan for thee,
So certainly, He cannot fail!
Rest on the faithfulness of God,
In Him thou surely shalt prevail.",
"3": "The Lord will silently plan for thee
Some wonderful surprise of love.
Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard,
But it is kept for thee to prove.",
"4": "The Lord will silently plan for thee,
His purpose He'll to thee unfold;
The tangled skein shall shine at last,
A masterpiece of skill untold.",
"5": "The Lord will silently plan for thee,
A happy child kept in His care
As though no other claimed His love,
But thou alone to Him wert dear."}
