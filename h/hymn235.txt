His wonderful love proclaim!\nHail Him! hail Him! mightiest angels in glory;\nStrength and honor give to His holy name!\nLike a shepherd, Jesus will feed His people,\nIn His arms He carries them all day long;\nO ye saints that live in the light of His presence,\nPraise Him! praise Him! ever in joyful song!", "2 Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,\nFor our sins He suffered and bled and died;\nHe, our Rock, our Hope of eternal salvation,\nHail Him! hail Him! Jesus, the Crucified;\nLoving Savior, meekly enduring sorrow,\nCrowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow;\nOnce for us rejected, despised, and forsaken,\nPrince of Glory, ever triumphant now.", "3 Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,\nHeavenly portals, loud with hosannahs ring!\nJesus, Savior, reigneth for ever and ever;\nCrown Him! crown Him! Prophet and Priest and King!\nDeath is vanquished! Tell it with joy, ye faithful,\nWhere is now thy victory, boasting grave?\nJesus lives! No longer thy portals are cheerless;\nJesus lives, the mighty and strong to save."]
