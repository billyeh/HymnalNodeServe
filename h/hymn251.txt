{"1": "Rivers of living water,
Rivers that flow from the throne,
Rivers o'erflowing with blessing,
Coming from Jesus alone.",
"chorus": "Rivers of living water,
Rivers of life so free,
Flowing from Thee, my Savior,
Send now the rivers through me.",
"2": "Whoso is thirsty come hither,
Here is abundant supply;
Water transparent as crystal,
Come without money and buy.",
"3": "Cleanse me, oh, cleanse me, my Savior,
Make me a channel today;
Empty me, fill me and use me,
Teach me to trust and obey.",
"4": "Then, and then only, Lord Jesus,
Through me the rivers can flow;
Thus and thus only will others
Learn Thy great fulness to know.",
"5": "Now I surrender to Jesus,
Here I lay all at His feet;
Anything, anywhere only,
Just for His service made meet!"}
