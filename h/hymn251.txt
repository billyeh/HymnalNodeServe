["1 Rivers of living water,\nRivers that flow from the throne,\nRivers o'erflowing with blessing,\nComing from Jesus alone.", "chorus Rivers of living water,\nRivers of life so free,\nFlowing from Thee, my Savior,\nSend now the rivers through me.", "2 Whoso is thirsty come hither,\nHere is abundant supply;\nWater transparent as crystal,\nCome without money and buy.", "3 Cleanse me, oh, cleanse me, my Savior,\nMake me a channel today;\nEmpty me, fill me and use me,\nTeach me to trust and obey.", "4 Then, and then only, Lord Jesus,\nThrough me the rivers can flow;\nThus and thus only will others\nLearn Thy great fulness to know.", "5 Now I surrender to Jesus,\nHere I lay all at His feet;\nAnything, anywhere only,\nJust for His service made meet!"]
