{"1": ""With one accord" within an upper room
The faithful followers of Jesus met:
One was the hope of every waiting soul,
And on one object great each heart was set.",
"2": ""With one accord," until the mighty gift
Of pentecostal power was outpoured;
Then forth as witnesses possessed of God,
To preach the resurrection of the Lord!",
"3": ""With one accord" within the house of God
A hallelujah song is daily raised,
As with the voice of one, from vocal hearts
Christ Jesus' name is glorified and praised.",
"4": "Pour down Thy Spirit once again, dear Lord;
Our cry goes up to Thee for "latter rain";
Unite Thy people as the "heart of one,"
And pentecostal days shall come again!"}
