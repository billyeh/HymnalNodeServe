{"1": "O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now,
Who in our spirit lives;
One spirit have the two become
Which oneness to us gives.",
"2": "Thy Spirit with our spirit, Lord
The witness ever bears,
That we the Father's children are,
And of God's glory heirs.",
"3": "'Tis in our spirit Thee we touch,
Thy riches to enjoy
And as the Spirit Thou dost give,
Thyself without alloy.",
"4": "'Tis in our spirit we may walk,
And follow Thee alway
While, as the Spirit, Thou dost lead,
And light impart each day.",
"5": "In spirit, by Thy Spirit, Lord
We live and worship Thee;
Thou, in our spirit, thru Thine own,
Strengtheneth constantly.",
"6": "In spirit, with Thy Spirit, Lord
We offer prayer to Thee
While, as the Spirit, Thou in us,
Groanest unutterably.",
"7": "We to our spirit would return,
And there would contact Thine;
'Tis in the spirit we may share,
Our heritage divine.",
"8": "What oneness, O my Lord, is this-
Two spirits intertwine!
Thy Spirit in our spirit lives
And ours abides in Thine!"}
