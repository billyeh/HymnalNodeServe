{"1": "Th' anointing's here! The Lord is moving now in us;
The ointment dear to us has been applied.
His blood prevails! It gives to us the fellowship,
And now we have the living flow of life.",
"chorus": "Sisters:
Th' anointing's here! O Christian brothers,
Th' anointing's here! We have believed.
Within our spirit, the Spirit's moving,
And this from Him we have received.

Brothers:
Th' anointing's here! O Christian sisters,
The flow within will never cease.
As He anoints us, we are abiding-
O Hallelujah! Life and peace!",
"2": "Th' anointing's here! 'Tis God Himself that blends with us,
And now the two are mingled into one.
And hour by hour we live, and move, and have our life
In God Himself-the Spirit through the Son.",
"3": "Th' anointing's here! It teaches us in everything;
The sense of life we always have within.
Obey this sense, and you will know what you must do,
And live by Life-Yes, clear in everything."}
