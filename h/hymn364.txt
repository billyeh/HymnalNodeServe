{"1": "Jesus, my life, Thyself apply;
Thy Holy Spirit breathe;
My vile affections crucify;
Conform me to Thy death.",
"2": "Conqu'ror of hell and earth and sin,
Still with the rebel strive;
Enter my soul and work within,
And kill and make alive.",
"3": "More of Thy life, and more I have,
As the old Adam dies;
Bury me, Savior, in Thy grave,
That I with Thee may rise.",
"4": "Reign in me, Lord; Thy foes control,
Who would not own Thy sway;
Diffuse Thine image through my soul;
Shine to the perfect day.",
"5": "Scatter the last remains of sin,
And seal me Thine abode;
O make me glorious all within,
A temple built by God!"}
