And my life within;
Sharing in the spirit,
I unite with Him.",

Living in the Lord
Life He doth supply me,
And His peace afford.",

Bound I'll never be
For the law of life now,
Sets me wholly free.",

I'll the spirit mind;
Self-will never follow
But the Spirit's find.",

Spiritual to be!
E'en my body quick'ning,
By His pow'r in me.",

Witnesseth in one
I'm of God begotten
Heir with Christ the Son."}
