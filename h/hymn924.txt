["1 Along the shores of Galilee,\nWhen Christ five thousand fed,\nNot one was omitted\nIn the breaking of the bread.\nToday they die in heathen lands,\nThey die in want and dread,\nFor they have been omitted\nIn the breaking of the Bread.", "chorus Lord, I would give them the Bread of Life,\nThe Living Water too;\nMy heart cries out, \"Oh, here am I,\nReady, Thy will to do.\"", "2 Long years have passed and few have heard\nThat Jesus Christ has bled,\nThat they might feed on Him who died\nTo be that Living Bread.\nTo gods of stone and wood they cry,\nYet they are never fed,\nFor they have been omitted\nIn the breaking of the Bread.", "3 Great God, who gave Thine only Son,\nHelp us, now Spirit-led,\nTo tell the story of Thy love\nTo those who ask for bread.\nThen gladly will we go or send,\nTill this blest news has spread,\nAnd they have been included\nIn the breaking of the Bread."]
