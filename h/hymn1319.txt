{"1": "That which for long the prophets sought,
The righteous yearned to see,
Has in these last of days appeared
In its reality.",
"chorus": "And we're now in the final stages,
'Tis the completion of all the ages.
All those who believed the promise
Are perfected now in us.",
"2": "Oh, blessed are our eyes that see,
Our ears, how blessed to hear;
Things angels ne'er could look into
Are now to us made clear.",
"3": "Our sense is corporate, bold and strong,
His grace, how free to take;
Encouraging the others on,
Run for the kingdom's sake.",
"4": "We're weary not this race to run,
It makes our joy complete;
For this we know, around the bend,
The Lord we'll surely meet."}
