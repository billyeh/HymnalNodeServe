{"1": "Not by wrestling, but by clinging
Shall we be most blest;
Wrestling only brings us sorrow;
Clinging brings us rest.",
"2": "When we stay our feeble efforts,
And from struggling cease,
Unconditional surrender
Brings us God's own peace.",
"3": "Lean we all our weight on Jesus,
Who alone can save;
He by might of love hath triumphed
O'er His willing slave.",
"4": "Yielding, we shall know true conquest;
Dying, we shall live;
"Not my will, but Thine" prevaileth,
Victory to give."}
