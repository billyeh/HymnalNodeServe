{"1": "The holiest of God's temple is,
The inmost part; the mercy seat
God's presence and the ark are there
And there the priests the Lord may meet.",
"2": "Now we're God's temple in three parts;
Our inmost part the spirit is;
There God and Christ as Spirit dwell
The holiest place of holy 'tis.",
"3": "'Tis here within our inmost part,
That God in Christ is all to us;
'Tis here the Holy Spirit makes,
The Lord reality to us.",
"4": "'Tis here within the spirit-part,
We contact Christ and dwell with Him;
'Tis by our spirit we with God,
Have fellowship and worship Him.",
"5": "'Tis here that Christ is like the land,
Where we may dwell, its wealth enjoy;
'Tis here that we must fight the foe
And Christ's authority employ.",
"6": "The spirit we must seek to know
Discerning spirit from the soul
And live within this holiest place
To worship God and reach His goal.",
"7": "The soul we ever must forsake
Press on, God's rest to enter in
That Christ we may possess in full,
And all God's plan fulfill therein."}
