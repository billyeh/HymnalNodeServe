{"1": "The Church is Christ's own Body
The Father's dwelling-place
The gathering of the called ones
God blended with man's race;
Elect before creation
Redeemed by Calv'ry's death
Her character and standing,
Of heaven, not of earth.",
"2": "New man of new creation
Born through her risen Lord
Baptized in God the Spirit
Made holy by His Word;
Christ is her life and content
Himself her glorious Head;
She has ascended with Him,
O'er all her foes to tread.",
"3": "Christ is her one foundation
None other man may lay;
All that she has, as Christ, is,
Divine in every way;
Her members through the Spirit,
Their death on Calv'ry own;
They're built in resurrection-
Gold, silver, precious stone.",
"4": "One God, one Lord, one Spirit-
Her elements all one-
One faith, one hope, one baptism
One Body in the Son;
The triune God is in her
One Body members own
By faith they are united
In hope of glory shown.",
"5": "From every tribe and nation,
Do all the members come
Regardless of their classes,
United to be one.
No high there is, nor lowly
No Jew, nor Gentile clan
No free, nor slave, nor master
But Christ, the "one new man.",
"6": "One Body universal
One in each place expressed;
Locality of dwelling,
Her only ground possessed;
Administration local
Each answ'ring to the Lord;
Communion universal
Upheld in one accord.",
"7": "Her local gatherings model,
The New Jerusalem;
Its aspects and its details,
Must show in all of them.
Christ is the Lamp that shineth
With God within, the Light;
They are the lampstands bearing,
His glorious Image bright."}
