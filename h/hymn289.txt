["1 I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,\nConfused at the grace that so fully He proffers me;\nI tremble to know that for me He was crucified,\nThat for me, a sinner, He suffered, He bled and died.", "chorus O it is wonderful that He should care for me\nEnough to die for me!\nO it is wonderful, wonderful to me!", "2 I marvel that He would descend from His throne divine\nTo rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;\nThat He should extend His great love unto such as I,\nSufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.", "3 I think of His side, pierced and bleeding to pay the debt,\nSuch mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?\nNo, no! I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,\nAnd testify all my desires He doth fully meet."]
