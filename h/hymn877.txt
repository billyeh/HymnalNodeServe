["1 I dare not be defeated\nWith Calvary in view,\nWhere Jesus conquered Satan,\nWhere all His foes He slew;\nCome, Lord, and give the vision\nTo nerve me for the fight,\nMake me an overcomer\nClothed with Thy Spirit's might.", "chorus A victor, a victor!\nBecause of Calvary.\nMake me an overcomer,\nA conqu'ror, a conqu'ror, Lord, in Thee.", "2 I dare not be defeated\nSince Christ, my conquering King\nHas called me to the battle\nWhich He did surely win.\nCome, Lord, and give me courage,\nThy conquering Spirit give,\nMake me an overcomer,\nIn power within me live.", "3 I dare not be defeated,\nWhen Jesus leads me on\nTo press through hellish regions\nTo share with Him His Throne;\nCome, Lord, and give Thy soldier\nThe power to wield the sword,\nMake me an overcomer\nThrough Thine inerrant Word.", "4 I dare not be defeated,\nJust at the set of sun,\nWhen Jesus waits to whisper,\n\"Well done, beloved, well done\";\nCome, Lord, bend from the Glory,\nOn me Thy Spirit cast,\nMake me an overcomer,\nA victor to the last."]
