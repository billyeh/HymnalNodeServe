{"1": "The veil is rent! Lo! Jesus stands
Before the throne of grace;
And clouds of incense from His hands
Fill all that glorious place.",
"2": "His precious blood is sprinkled there,
Before and on the throne;
And His own wounds in heav'n declare
His work on earth is done.",
"3": "'Tis finished!" on the cross He said,
In agonies and blood;
'Tis finished: "now He lives to plead
Before the face of God.",
"4": "'Tis finished!" Here our souls can rest,
His work can never fail;
By Him, our Sacrifice and Priest
We enter through the veil."}
