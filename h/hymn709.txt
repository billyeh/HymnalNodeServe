{"1": "Jesus triumphant when the storm-clouds break,
And the loud thunder bids the soul awake;
When biting blasts lay earthly projects low,
And one by one the fondest treasures go.",
"2": "Jesus triumphant, through the fleeting years;
Jesus triumphant, spite of blinding tears;
High over all, to hear Thy loving voice,
Which bids the heart look upward and rejoice.",
"3": "Jesus triumphant, when in work for Thee,
Sad and disheartened, no results we see;
When gathered force of evil seems to win,
And work for Christ seems lost in work of sin.",
"4": "Jesus triumphant all along the line;
Triumphant Savior, all Thy triumph mine;
For since I am a partner in Thy love,
My life on earth is lived through Thee above.",
"5": "Jesus triumphant when the spirit wings
Onward and upward to the King of kings;
And through the last great triumph of Thy grace
Triumphant saints shall see Thee face to face."}
