["1 Jesus triumphant when the storm-clouds break,\nAnd the loud thunder bids the soul awake;\nWhen biting blasts lay earthly projects low,\nAnd one by one the fondest treasures go.", "2 Jesus triumphant, through the fleeting years;\nJesus triumphant, spite of blinding tears;\nHigh over all, to hear Thy loving voice,\nWhich bids the heart look upward and rejoice.", "3 Jesus triumphant, when in work for Thee,\nSad and disheartened, no results we see;\nWhen gathered force of evil seems to win,\nAnd work for Christ seems lost in work of sin.", "4 Jesus triumphant all along the line;\nTriumphant Savior, all Thy triumph mine;\nFor since I am a partner in Thy love,\nMy life on earth is lived through Thee above.", "5 Jesus triumphant when the spirit wings\nOnward and upward to the King of kings;\nAnd through the last great triumph of Thy grace\nTriumphant saints shall see Thee face to face."]
