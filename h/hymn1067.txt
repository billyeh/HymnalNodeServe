["1 There was One who was willing to die in my stead,\nThat a soul so unworthy might live,\nAnd the path to the cross He was willing to tread\nAll the sins of my life to forgive.", "chorus They were borne on the cross,\nThey were borne on the cross,\nO how much He was willing to bear!\nWith what anguish and loss,\nJesus went to the cross!\nBut He carried my sins with Him there.", "2 He is tender and loving and patient with me,\nWhile He cleanses my heart of its dross;\nBut \"there's no condemnation,\" I know I am free,\nFor my sins were all borne on the cross.", "3 I will cling to my Savior and never depart-\nI will joyfully journey each day,\nWith a song on my lips and a song in my heart,\nThat my sins have been taken away."]
