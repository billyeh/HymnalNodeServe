{"1": "The Church the vessel is to Christ
Him to contain and Him express
Just as the human body doth,
Man's life show forth, his life possess.",
"2": "As was the temple to the ark
Receptacle and resting-place;
So Christ the Church's content is
And in the Church, Christ's dwelling-place.",
"3": "As Christ is God's true mystery
God to explain and God express;
So is the Church Christ's mystery
Christ to explain and manifest.",
"4": "The members of the Church of Christ,
Are all primarily of clay;
They need to be transformed and made,
Transparent, precious day by day.",
"5": "By transformation they are built
A vessel they to Christ afford;
His all-inclusiveness they hold;
Transparent, they express the Lord.",
"6": "Thru all the transformation work,
The triune God performs in them
The Church a corporate vessel is,
And like the new Jerusalem.",
"7": "How precious she in each respect
Transparent too in every phase;
Christ with God's fulness she contains
Christ with God's glory she displays.",
"8": "With Christ as life, with God as light
And with the Spirit's living flow
The triune God she manifests,
For all the universe to know."}
