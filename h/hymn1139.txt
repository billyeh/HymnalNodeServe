{"1": "I will get me to the mountain,
I will get me to the hill;
In Thy death and resurrection,
Jesus, take me deeper still.",
"chorus": "I will get me to the mountain,
Willingly would get me there.
All my self fore'er forsaking,
One with Thee, O Lord,
Thy death to share.",
"2": "Still at times I sense the shadows
Of my nature, untransformed;
Lord, I'll go unto the mountain,
To Thy death to be conformed.",
"3": "On the mountain till the daybreak,
Linger I, Lord, thus with Thee,
May Thy all-transforming Spirit
Saturate me thoroughly.",
"4": "Mingled with Thee on the mountain,
Soon my sun begins to shine;
Death has worked her deep impression,
Now my nature's one with Thine."}
