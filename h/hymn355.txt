{"1": "O blessed, living Lord,
Engage our hearts with Thee,
And strike within some answ'ring chord
To love so rich and free!",
"2": "To know Thy loving heart!
To cleave to Thy blest side!
To gaze upon Thee where Thou art,
And in Thy love abide!",
"3": "To walk with Thee below!
To learn Thy holy ways!
And more to Thine own stature grow,
To Thine eternal praise!",
"4": "Thyself our one Desire!
Thyself our Object here!
The goal to which our hearts aspire-
To meet Thee in the air!"}
