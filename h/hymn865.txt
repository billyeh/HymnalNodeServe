{"1": "In spirit and in truth, O Lord
We meet to worship here;
As taught by Christ, the Son of God
We now in Him draw near.",
"2": "Thank God, He is a Spirit true
So near, so dear to us;
That we may contact Him in life
In truth to worship thus.",
"3": "A spirit God has made for us,
That we may worship Him
Not striving, serving outwardly
But seeking from within.",
"4": "Regenerated by the Lord
Renewed in mind and heart
He dwells within us as our life,
True worship to impart.",
"5": "We worship here according to,
The inner consciousness
Anointed by His Spirit now,
His fulness we express.",
"6": "In truth we serve and worship too
In shadows nevermore
In Christ, the one reality
The Father we adore.",
"7": "To God we offer Christ the Lord,
Whom we experience;
With God we too delight in Him.
His light and sweetness sense.",
"8": "In spirit and reality,
Together here we meet
To worship, praise, and fellowship,
Around the mercy-seat."}
