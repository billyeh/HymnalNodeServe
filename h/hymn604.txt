["1 Unto the hills around do I lift up\nMy longing eyes;\nO whence for me shall my salvation come,\nFrom whence arise?\nFrom God the Lord doth come my certain aid,\nFrom God the Lord, who heav'n and earth hath made.", "2 He will not suffer that thy foot be moved:\nSafe shalt thou be.\nNo careless slumber shall His eyelids close,\nWho keepeth thee.\nBehold, He sleepeth not, He slumbereth ne'er,\nWho keepeth Israel in His holy care.", "3 Jehovah is Himself thy keeper true,\nThy changeless shade;\nJehovah thy defense on thy right hand\nHimself hath made.\nAnd thee no sun by day shall ever smite;\nNo moon shall harm thee in the silent night.", "4 From every evil shall He keep thy soul,\nFrom every sin;\nJehovah shall preserve thy going out,\nThy coming in.\nAbove thee, watching, He whom we adore\nShall keep thee henceforth, yea, for evermore."]
