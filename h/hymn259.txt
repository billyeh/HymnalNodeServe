{"1": "Lord, I hear of show'rs of blessing
Thou art scatt'ring full and free,
Show'rs the thirsty land refreshing;
Let some drops now fall on me.",
"chorus": "Even me, even me,
Let some drops now fall on me.",
"2": "Pass me not, O gracious Father!
Sinful though my heart may be;
Thou might'st leave me, but the rather
Let Thy mercy fall on me.",
"3": "Pass me not, O tender Savior!
Let me love and cling to Thee;
I am longing for Thy favor;
While Thou'rt calling, call for me.",
"4": "Pass me not, O Lord, the Spirit!
Thou canst make the blind to see;
By the Witness of Thy merit,
Speak the word of power to me.",
"5": "Love of God, so pure and changeless!
Blood of Christ, so rich and free!
Grace of God, so strong and boundless!
Magnify them all in me.",

Bind my heart, O Lord, to Thee;
While the streams of life are springing,
Blessing others, oh, bless me."}
