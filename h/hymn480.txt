{"1": "Joined unto Christ the Conqueror,
His Calv'ry triumph, too,
Assures me in the darkest hour
That He will take me through.",
"2": "Joined unto Christ the risen Lord,
Triumphant now above;
The glory of His cross reveals
Magnificence of love.",
"3": "Joined unto Christ's full victory,
Magnificently free;
Declare it in the conquering name,
And powers of darkness flee.",
"4": "Joined unto Christ! Magnificent!
His wondrous Calvary plan,
Draws us through ages to adore;
For "Worthy is the Lamb.""}
