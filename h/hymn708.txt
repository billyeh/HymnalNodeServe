["1 Fresh as the dew of the morning\nBringing a sweet rest unheard\nChrist, in the gentle anointing\nWhispers His comforting word:\nStand till the trial is over\nStand till the tempest is gone\nStand for the glory of Jesus\nStand till the kingdom is won.", "chorus Lord of all hope, O how,\nsweet is Thy voice\nMaking my heart in Thy,\npresence rejoice.", "2 If in the test of my trouble\nFaint be my spirit and heart\nFaith, with the star of hope glimm'ring\nShall all be taken apart\nMay then Thy faith with Thy life-pow'r,\nOver me hold its full sway,\nThat all Thy riches of glory,\nNow I may share and for aye.", "3 Lord, as the morning sun dawning\nChase all my darkness away\nAnd with Thy kind wings of healing,\nTurn all my night into day.\nCome Thou, O come, Lord of comfort\nCome to my sad, weary heart\nCome, O Thou blest hope of glory\nNever, O never depart."]
