{"1": "The birthright God has giv'n to us
Must be our goal, our highest prize,
For we're the church of the first-born-
Let us our portion realize!",
"2": "A double portion of the land
Was Joseph's birthright-and 'tis ours
If we our garments keep from sin,
And stay pure in temptation's hour.",
"3": "The priesthood was to Levi giv'n
As his inheritance-for he
Did count his family ties but loss
And owned God's things supreme to be.",
"4": "The kingship, Judah did receive
For tending to young Joseph's need;
Through Benjamin's adversity,
He was his comforter indeed.",
"5": "The double portion we would seek,
The priesthood and the kingship too;
Make us so desperate, Lord, for Thee
That Thee, our birthright, we'd pursue.",
"6": "We would be those who pay the price,
Deny the soul, reject the self;
Ambitious for the birthright thus
We'd gain Thee, Lord, above all else.",
"7": "The promise, Lord, 'twas giv'n to us,
Oh, let us ne'er this right despise;
Enflame us, Lord, to gain Thyself,
And Thee, our birthright realize."}
