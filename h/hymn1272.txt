["1 The birthright God has giv'n to us\nMust be our goal, our highest prize,\nFor we're the church of the first-born-\nLet us our portion realize!", "2 A double portion of the land\nWas Joseph's birthright-and 'tis ours\nIf we our garments keep from sin,\nAnd stay pure in temptation's hour.", "3 The priesthood was to Levi giv'n\nAs his inheritance-for he\nDid count his family ties but loss\nAnd owned God's things supreme to be.", "4 The kingship, Judah did receive\nFor tending to young Joseph's need;\nThrough Benjamin's adversity,\nHe was his comforter indeed.", "5 The double portion we would seek,\nThe priesthood and the kingship too;\nMake us so desperate, Lord, for Thee\nThat Thee, our birthright, we'd pursue.", "6 We would be those who pay the price,\nDeny the soul, reject the self;\nAmbitious for the birthright thus\nWe'd gain Thee, Lord, above all else.", "7 The promise, Lord, 'twas giv'n to us,\nOh, let us ne'er this right despise;\nEnflame us, Lord, to gain Thyself,\nAnd Thee, our birthright realize."]
