{"1": "Rest, rest thee, weary heart,
Let toil and anguish cease;
Take from Thy Savior's hands
Thine heritage of peace.",
"2": "Lie low before His feet,
Too low thou canst not be,
For sacred calm is here,
And here is liberty.",
"3": "Submit, lay down thine arms,
Nor question, nor rebel;
So shalt thou hear erewhile
His whisper, It is well.",
"4": "No secret wound of thine,
Though it be great or small,
Presume to hide from Him;
Confess, confess it all;",
"5": "Nor merit of thine own
Upon His altar place;
All is of Christ alone,
And of His perfect grace.",
"6": "Rest, rest thee, weary heart,
Let care and anguish cease;
Take from thy Savior's hands
Thine heritage of peace."}
