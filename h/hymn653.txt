["1 Rest, rest thee, weary heart,\nLet toil and anguish cease;\nTake from Thy Savior's hands\nThine heritage of peace.", "2 Lie low before His feet,\nToo low thou canst not be,\nFor sacred calm is here,\nAnd here is liberty.", "3 Submit, lay down thine arms,\nNor question, nor rebel;\nSo shalt thou hear erewhile\nHis whisper, It is well.", "4 No secret wound of thine,\nThough it be great or small,\nPresume to hide from Him;\nConfess, confess it all;", "5 Nor merit of thine own\nUpon His altar place;\nAll is of Christ alone,\nAnd of His perfect grace.", "6 Rest, rest thee, weary heart,\nLet care and anguish cease;\nTake from thy Savior's hands\nThine heritage of peace."]
