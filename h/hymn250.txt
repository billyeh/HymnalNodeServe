{"1": "Spring up, well, with water;
Dig Thou, Lord, completely;
Dig away all barriers,
That Thy stream flow through me.",
"2": "Christ, the Rock, is riven;
Living water's flowing;
But within my heart now,
It is blocked from going.",
"3": "I will dig by praying
Dig the dirt entirely
Thus release the Spirit
Let the stream flow freely.",
"4": "There's no need again that,
Christ, the Rock, be riven
But unto the digging,
That I should be given.",
"5": "What I need most deeply,
Is the Spirit's filling
That the living water,
From my heart be welling.",
"6": "Dig till there is nothing,
Left to block the passage;
Dig until the stream flows,
With the living message.",
"7": "Spring up, well, with water;
Dig Thou, Lord, completely;
Dig away all barriers,
That Thy stream flow through me."}
