{"1": "Lo, the central thought of God,
Is that He be one with man;
He to man is everything,
That He might fulfill His plan.",
"2": "Earthen vessel man was made-
Body, soul, and spirit too
God as life that he may take,
And with Him have oneness true.",
"3": "By the flow of life divine
Man becomes a precious stone,
Fit for building God's abode
That His glory might be known.",
"4": "'Tis the city God hath built
'Tis the dwelling God requires
'Tis the new Jerusalem,
Which fulfills His heart's desires.",
"5": "'Tis the building of the saints
'Tis the blend of God and man
Purposed by the Father's will,
Long before the world began.",
"6": "In its center, as its pow'r
Is the throne of Christ and God
Whence doth flow the stream of life,
As the Spirit's living flood.",
"7": "Christ, the tree of life, is there,
In the flowing of the stream
Yielding fruit of life divine,
As the food of life supreme.",
"8": "God in Christ, the glorious light
Thru the city brightly shines
Scattering all the deathly night,
With its light of life divine.",
"9": "God in man and man in God,
Mutual dwelling thus possess;
God the content is to man
And the man doth God express."}
