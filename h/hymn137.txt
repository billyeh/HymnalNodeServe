{"1": "All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name!
Before Him prostrate fall;
With one accord His praise proclaim,
And crown Him Lord of all!",
"2": "Ye saints redeemed from Adam's race,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.",
"3": "Tell forth the only Name that's giv'n
On which we now may call,
The Name adored by hosts in heav'n,
And crown Him Lord of all.",
"4": "In glory all the ransomed throng
Soon at His feet shall fall;
Join in the blest eternal song,
And crown Him Lord of all.
note: "(Repeat the last two lines of each stanza)"}
