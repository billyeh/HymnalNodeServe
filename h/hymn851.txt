{"1": "How lovely is Thy dwelling-place!
Within Thy courts I long to be;
Thy presence, Lord, my spirit craves
For this my heart cries out to Thee.",
"2": "At Thy burnt-offering altar, Lord
And at Thine incense altar blest
Even the sparrow finds a home
And swallow there prepares her nest.",
"3": "Men, as the sparrow, frail and small
When living in Thy house find rest
Relying on the altar's blood
Enjoying there the incense blest.",
"4": "How blessed are those men indeed!
Trusting in Thee they are made strong;
Highways to Zion in their hearts
The way they care not, rough or long.",
"5": "Passing the weeping valley they,
Make it a place of springing wells;
The rain with blessings covers it,
And in the way God's mercy tells.",
"6": "From strength to strength they go, and all,
Before the Lord in Zion meet;
Thus ever seeking Thine own self
They need Thy care and grace replete.",
"7": "Better a day within Thy courts,
Than days a thousand I would tell;
I'd rather at Thy threshold stand,
Than in the wicked's tents to dwell.",
"8": "Thou art a sun, Thou art a shield
Thou grace and glory wilt supply;
Thy presence and Thy very self,
My need in fulness satisfy.",
"9": "Not one good thing wilt Thou withhold,
From those who walk in uprightness;
Bless'd is the man that trusts in Thee,
With grace and glory measureless."}
