{"1": "One new man is the Father's plan;
He redeemed us from the sons of men.
Every kindred, tribe and tongue,
In Himself He called us to be one.
God's expression on the earth
Now reveals His glorious worth.
One new man is the Father's plan;
He redeemed us from the sons of men.",
"2": "On the cross ordinances slain,
That He might form just one of twain.
Reconciling us to God,
Thus on the serpent's head He trod.
He breaks down the middle wall
As upon His name we call;
On the cross ordinances slain,
That He might form just one of twain.",
"3": "For this cause Your Person, Lord,
We take and stand in one accord;
All the members self forsake,
And of the Body-Christ partake.
We in Christ as one new man
Now come forth to take this land.
For this cause Your Person, Lord,
We take and stand in one accord."}
