{"1": "Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption;
No riches of earth could have saved my poor soul.
The blood of the cross is my only foundation;
The death of my Savior now maketh me whole.",
"chorus": "I am redeemed, but not with silver;
I am bought, but not with gold;
Bought with a price-the blood of Jesus,
Precious price of love untold.",
"2": "Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption;
The guilt on my conscience too heavy had grown.
The blood of the cross is my only foundation;
The death of my Savior I only can own.",
"3": "Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption;
The holy commandment forbade me draw near.
The blood of the cross is my only foundation;
The death of my Savior removeth my fear.",
"4": "Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption;
The way to God's kingdom could not thus be bought.
The blood of the cross is my only foundation;
The death of my Savior redemption hath wrought."}
