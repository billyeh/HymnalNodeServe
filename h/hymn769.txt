{"1": "To the holiest place I'd come
There within the veil to be;
There to touch the throne of grace
Let life's water flow thru me.",
"2": "Now the holiest place of all,
Right within my spirit is;
Here the Lord in me abides
And my spirit joins with His.",
"3": "To my spirit I'd return
For 'tis here the Lord I'll meet;
O how marvellous it is!
He's within, in me complete.",
"4": "Fragrance of the risen Christ,
Thru my spirit may be spread;
If in spirit I will pray,
Christ will be exhibited.",
"5": "If in spirit Him I touch
With His riches filled I'll be;
Life and light and love and grace,
As a stream will flow thru me.",
"6": "Touching deeply, richly I,
Of Himself experience
Thus the law of life I touch,
And His clear anointing sense.",
"7": "In my spirit deeper still,
I would touch the Lord I love
Touch Him in His hidden depth,
And His hidden manna prove.",
"8": "When the resurrection life,
Is made real in pow'r to me
As the rod with sprouting buds
I will then accepted be.",
"9": "Here I find the throne of grace
Where the living water flows,
As a river full of grace,
Into me grace to bestow.",
"10": "Then whene'er we meet to pray
All our spirits we'll release;
Mingled will our spirits be
And we'll serve the Lord as priests.",
"11": "This the holiest place is too
Where we all may touch the Lord
Touch His throne in many ways,
Till His grace on us is poured."}
