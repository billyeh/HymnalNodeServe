{"1": "For the Church should be our service
'Tis the perfect will of God;
'Tis the only way of working,
Which the Lord's apostles trod.",
"chorus": "For the Church should be our service
Not our aims to satisfy;
This, the perfect will of God is
And with it we must comply.",
"2": "For 'tis God's eternal purpose,
That the Church His vessel be;
He intends that all our service,
Build His Church continually.",
"3": "All the gifted persons given,
To the Body by the Head,
Are to aid the Church's building
That to fulness she be led.",
"4": "All the gifts and all the functions
All the spirit's power shown
All the ministries are given,
For the Church and that alone.",
"5": "All the preaching of the Gospel
All the teaching ministry
Every other kind of service,
For the church alone should be.",
"6": "Ministry is for the Churches
Not the Church for ministry;
All the lampstands are the Churches
Not a form of ministry.",
"7": "This will keep the Church's oneness
Saving us from every sect;
This will ever test our motives
And our aim will thus correct.",
"8": "Lord, deliver us from our work
From the work of any sect;
For Thy Church alone we'd labor,
And its building up effect."}
