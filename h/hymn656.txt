["1 \"Consider Him,\" let Christ thy pattern be,\nAnd know that He hath apprehended thee\nTo share His very life, His pow'r divine,\nAnd in the likeness of thy Lord to shine.", "2 \"Consider Him\"; so shalt thou, day by day,\nSeek out the lowliest place, and therein stay,\nContent to pass away, a thing of nought,\nThat glory to the Father's name be brought.", "3 Shrink not, O child of God, but fearless go\nDown into death with Jesus; thou shalt know\nThe power of an endless life begin,\nWith glorious liberty from self and sin.", "4 \"Consider Him,\" and thus thy life shall be\nFilled with self-sacrifice and purity;\nGod will work out in thee the pattern true,\nAnd Christ's example ever keep in view.", "5 \"Consider Him,\" and as you run the race,\nKeep ever upward looking in His face;\nAnd thus transformed, illumined thou shalt be,\nAnd Christ's own image shall be seen in thee."]
