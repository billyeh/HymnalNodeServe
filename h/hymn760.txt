{"1": "She only touched the hem of His garment
As to His side she stole,
Amid the crowd that gathered around Him;
And straightway she was whole.",
"chorus": "Oh, touch the hem of His garment,
And thou, too, shalt be free!
His healing pow'r this very hour
Shall give new life to thee!",
"2": "She came in fear and trembling before Him,
She knew her Lord had come,
She felt that from Him virtue had healed her,
The mighty deed was done.",
"3": "He turned with "Daughter, be of good comfort,
Thy faith hath made thee whole";
And peace that passeth all understanding
With gladness filled her soul."}
