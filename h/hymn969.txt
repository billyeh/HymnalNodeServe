{"1": "Hark what a sound, and too divine for hearing,
Stirs on the earth and trembles in the air;
Is it the thunder of the Lord's appearing?
Is it the music of His people's prayer?",
"2": "Surely He cometh, and a thousand voices
Shout to the saints, and to the deaf and dumb;
Surely He cometh, and the earth rejoices,
Glad in His coming who hath sworn: "I come!",
"3": "This hath He done, and shall we not adore Him?
This shall He do, and can we still despair?
Come, let us quickly fling ourselves before Him, .
Cast at His feet the burden of our care.",
"4": "Thru life and death, thru sorrow and thru sinning
He shall suffice me, for He hath sufficed:
Christ is the end, for Christ was the beginning,
Christ the beginning, for the end is Christ."}
