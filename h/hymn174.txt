{"1": "O Morning Star, how fair and bright,
Thou beamest forth in truth and light!
O Sov'reign meek and lowly,
Thou Root of Jesse, David's Son,
My Lord and Master, Thou hast won
My heart to serve Thee solely!
Thou art holy,
Fair and glorious, all-victorious,
Rich in blessing,
Rule and might o'er all possessing.",
"2": "Thou heav'nly Brightness, Light divine,
O deep within my heart now shine,
And make Thee there an altar.
Fill me with joy and strength to be
Thy member, ever joined to Thee
In love that cannot falter;
Toward Thee longing
Doth possess me; turn and bless me;
Here in sadness
Eye and heart long for Thy gladness."}
