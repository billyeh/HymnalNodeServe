{"1": "Jesus, Fountain of my days,
Well-spring of my heart's delight,
Brightness of my morning rays,
Solace of my hours of night;
When I see Thee, I arise
To the hope of cloudless skies.",
"2": "Oh, how weary were the years
Ere Thy form to me was known;
Oh, how gloomy were the fears
When I seemed to be alone;
I despaired the storm to brave
Till Thy footprints touched the wave.",
"3": "But Thy presence on the deep
Calmed the pulses of the sea,
And the waters sank to sleep
In the rest of seeing Thee;
And my once rebellious will
Heard the mandate, Peace, be still!",
"4": "Now Thy will and mine are one,
Heart in heart, and hand in hand;
All the clouds have touched the sun,
And the ships have reached the land;
For Thy love has said to me,
No more night! and No more sea!"}
