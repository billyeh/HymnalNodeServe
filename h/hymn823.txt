{"1": "God before the world's foundation,
Chose the Church in Christ the Son
That the Church might share the sonship
Holy, blameless, with Him one;
That the Church be His possession,
With the Spirit as the seal
Of our heritage the earnest,
While His Son He does reveal.",
"2": "To the throne Christ has ascended
Far above all rule and power;
God has made Him Head o'er all things,
To the Church, His Body here.
All in all He ever filleth
And His fulness is expressed,
Through the Church, which is His Body,
And His image manifests.",
"3": "We, once dead in our offences
Walking in the worldly course
Lusts of flesh and mind fulfilling
Satan and his hosts their source
God with Christ has resurrected
Seated in the heavenlies;
We, His masterpiece, created,
In Christ Jesus, Him to please.",
"4": "Jews and Gentiles are one body-
God His myst'ry has made known-
On apostles, prophets founded
Jesus Christ the cornerstone;
We in Him are built together,
For God's dwelling manifest
Fitly framed by God the Spirit,
For His pleasure and His rest.",
"5": "In eternal ages purposed,
That His wisdom be made known
Was the Church, His hidden myst'ry
Where the Son could make His home;
That the saints may all in spirit,
Apprehend His boundlessness
Know His love which passes knowledge
All God's fulness to possess.",
"6": "One in body, hope, and Spirit
One in faith, one Lord, the Son
One baptizing, with one Father
That the Church may thus be one;
Christ to know in all His fulness
Unto manhood be matured
Ne'er by winds of doctrine carried
Nor by cunning men allured.
,",
"7": "Many gifts the Lord has given
That His Body He may build
That the saints may be perfected,
And their ministry fulfilled.
Thus we must put off the old man,
That we may put on the new;
Thus, renewed in mind and spirit
We will bear God's image true.",
"8": "Christ in love Himself has given,
That the Church be sanctified
Without blemish, spot, or wrinkle
To become His glorious bride.
He does nourish her and cherish,
As a man his body treats;
He and she become one body-
Thus the myst'ry very great.",
"9": "Body, house, new man the Church is
Bride, and temple, and yet more:
She's the army too which fighteth,
All God's foe to triumph o'er.
She is clothed with all God's armor
In His mighty strength is strong
Standing in the Lord, resisting
With all prayers she fighteth on."}
