["1 Through Thy precious body broken-\nInside the veil;\nOh! what words to sinners spoken-\nInside the veil.\nPrecious as the blood that bought us;\nPerfect, as the love that sought us;\nHoly, as the Lamb that brought us-\nInside the veil.", "2 When we see Thy love unshaken-\nOutside the camp.\nScorned by man, by God forsaken-\nOutside the camp.\nThy loved cross alone can charm us;\nShame need now no more alarm us;\nGlad we follow, nought can harm us-\nOutside the camp.", "3 Lamb of God, through Thee we enter-\nInside the veil.\nCleansed by Thee, we boldly venture-\nInside the veil.\nNot a stain; a new creation:\nOurs is such a full salvation;\nLow we bow in adoration-\nInside the veil.", "4 Unto Thee, the homeless stranger-\nOutside the camp,\nForth we hasten, fear no danger-\nOutside the camp.\nThy reproach, far richer treasure\nThan all Egypt's boasted pleasure;\nDrawn by love that knows no measure-\nOutside the camp.", "5 Soon Thy saints shall all be gathered-\nInside the veil.\nAll with Thee-no more be scattered-\nInside the veil.\nNought from Thee, our hearts shall sever;\nWe shall see Thee; grieve Thee never;\n\"Praise the Lamb!\" shall sound forever-\nInside the veil."]
