["1 We come, O Christ, to Thee,\nTrue Son of God and man,\nBy whom all things consist,\nIn whom all life began:\nIn Thee alone we live and move\nAnd have our being in Thy love.", "2 Thou art the Way to God,\nThy blood our ransom paid;\nIn Thee we face our Judge\nAnd Maker unafraid.\nBefore the Throne absolved we stand:\nThy love has met Thy law's demand.", "3 Thou art the living Truth!\nAll wisdom dwells in Thee,\nThou Source of every skill,\nEternal Verity!\nThou great I Am! In Thee we rest,\nTrue answer to our every quest.", "4 Thou only art true Life,\nTo know Thee is to live\nThe more abundant life\nThat earth can never give:\nO Risen Lord! We live in Thee\nAnd Thou in us eternally!", "5 We worship Thee Lord Christ,\nOur Savior and our King,\nTo Thee our youth and strength\nAdoringly we bring:\nSo fill our hearts that men may see\nThy life in us and turn to Thee!"]
