["1 Years I spent in sorrow 'round the cross,\nStill repenting over sins and dross.\nThen at last the river I did cross,\nTo touch the throne.", "chorus Mercy now is flowing, oh, the grace-\nThat I find of Him to run the race!\nBoldly now I come again to taste\nMy glorious Lord.", "2 In my Christian life I'd daily fall,\nSo I answered every altar-call,\nTill I left the altar, left it all,\nTo touch the throne.", "3 Brothers, to the Holiest forward come;\nLeave your sins behind, the race now run.\nHallelujah! All the work is done-\nThe veil is gone!", "4 Now within the veil, enjoying God,\nManna, law of life, and budding rod;\nChrist Himself, the ark, is our abode-\nHallelujah!"]
