{"1": "Years I spent in sorrow 'round the cross,
Still repenting over sins and dross.
Then at last the river I did cross,
To touch the throne.",
"chorus": "Mercy now is flowing, oh, the grace-
That I find of Him to run the race!
Boldly now I come again to taste
My glorious Lord.",
"2": "In my Christian life I'd daily fall,
So I answered every altar-call,
Till I left the altar, left it all,
To touch the throne.",
"3": "Brothers, to the Holiest forward come;
Leave your sins behind, the race now run.
Hallelujah! All the work is done-
The veil is gone!",
"4": "Now within the veil, enjoying God,
Manna, law of life, and budding rod;
Christ Himself, the ark, is our abode-
Hallelujah!"}
