["1 In daily walk and in our meetings too\nChrist is the center, Christ is everything;\n'Tis not for form nor doctrine good and true\nBut 'tis for Christ alone we're gathering.", "2 Christ is the way and Christ the light of life\nIn Him we walk and by Him we are led;\nChrist is the living water and the food;\nOf Him we drink and we with Him are fed.", "3 Christ is the truth, 'tis Him we testify\nChrist is the life, 'tis Him we minister;\nChrist is the Lord, 'tis Him we magnify\nChrist is the Head, and we exalt Him here.", "4 Christ is the All in all to God and man-\nWith Him both we and God are satisfied;\nChrist, the reality within the Church-\nBy Him are life and numbers multiplied.", "5 By all the hymns and prayers we offer here\nChrist the reality we would express;\nAll the activities in fellowship-\nChrist thus in operation manifest.", "6 'Tis in His Name we meet, in Spirit act\nWith nothing in our mind to formalize;\n'Tis by His pow'r we pray, in unction praise\nAnd with Himself in spirit exercise.", "7 All things forgetting, cleaving unto Christ\nApplying Him until maturity;\nLet us count everything but loss for Him\nFor Him, our All in all, eternally."]
