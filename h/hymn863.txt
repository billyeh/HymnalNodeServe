{"1": "In daily walk and in our meetings too
Christ is the center, Christ is everything;
'Tis not for form nor doctrine good and true
But 'tis for Christ alone we're gathering.",
"2": "Christ is the way and Christ the light of life
In Him we walk and by Him we are led;
Christ is the living water and the food;
Of Him we drink and we with Him are fed.",
"3": "Christ is the truth, 'tis Him we testify
Christ is the life, 'tis Him we minister;
Christ is the Lord, 'tis Him we magnify
Christ is the Head, and we exalt Him here.",
"4": "Christ is the All in all to God and man-
With Him both we and God are satisfied;
Christ, the reality within the Church-
By Him are life and numbers multiplied.",
"5": "By all the hymns and prayers we offer here
Christ the reality we would express;
All the activities in fellowship-
Christ thus in operation manifest.",
"6": "'Tis in His Name we meet, in Spirit act
With nothing in our mind to formalize;
'Tis by His pow'r we pray, in unction praise
And with Himself in spirit exercise.",
"7": "All things forgetting, cleaving unto Christ
Applying Him until maturity;
Let us count everything but loss for Him
For Him, our All in all, eternally."}
