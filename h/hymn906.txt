["1 How much can we do for our Savior?\nHow much for our dear fellow man?\nThe way to do more than we're able\nIs Jesus within to enable;\nThus we can do more than we can.", "2 How much can we be for our Savior\nIn life with its brief, fleeting span?\nIf Jesus within us is dwelling\nOur life and our actions infilling,\nWe all can do more than we can.", "3 How much can we bear for our Savior?\nHow much for our dear fellow man?\nIf in us His love is constraining,\nIf 'neath us His arms are sustaining,\nWe all can do more than we can.", "4 How much can we give for our Savior?\nTo succor our dear fellow man?\nIf from us His love is o'erflowing,\nOur life will be ever outgoing;\nWe'll always do more than we can."]
