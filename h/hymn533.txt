{"1": "For every sin however deep,
For every path however steep,
For all the weary ones who weep,
Thou art sufficient, Lord.",
"2": "For every trial great or small,
For every care that would appall,
For all the stumbling feet that fall,
Thou art sufficient, Lord.",
"3": "When earthly things bring sweet delight,
When all is well, and skies are bright,
When ease would cloud the heavenly light,
Thou art sufficient, Lord.",
"4": "When sorrow darkens all the day,
When disappointments bar the way,
When hearts are numb and cannot pray,
Thou art sufficient, Lord.",
"5": "Whate'er my circumstances be,
Help me in all Thy hand to see,
So wilt Thou then be unto me,
My all-sufficient Lord."}
