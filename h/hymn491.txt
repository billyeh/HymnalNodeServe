["1 Lord, Thou didst know when in the flesh\nAs such I'd know Thee shallowly;\nThen as the Spirit Thou didst come,\nWithin my spirit, known to be.", "2 In flesh Redeemer mine Thou art;\nAs Spirit now my Comforter.\nThe outward touch has passed away,\nFor inward union worthier.", "3 Because Thou art the Spirit now\nThyself revealing ceaselessly\nWithin my spirit I may know,\nThy presence and reality.", "4 I know Thy life surpassing far,\nThe knowledge Thy disciples had\nAlthough they walked and lived with Thee\nWhen Thou on earth in flesh wast clad.", "5 Because Thy Spirit dwells within\nHow real, O Lord, Thou art to me;\nNot touched, yet more reliable\nNot seen, yet loved more fervently.", "6 Thy Holy Spirit deep within,\nSupplies Thyself as righteousness\nAs holiness, redemption full\nAs wisdom and as fruitfulness.", "7 Thy Spirit in my spirit now,\nSupplies Thyself, unites with me\nThus I am all the time myself,\nAnd constantly am also Thee."]
