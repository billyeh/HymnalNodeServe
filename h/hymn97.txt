["1 Thy sorrows, Savior, we retrace,\nAnd tears of praise Thy griefs compel.\nWhat love and grace illume Thy face\nAs Jesus, as Immanuel!", "2 Amid Thy loneliness below,\nWhat scorn and outrage Thee befell:\nDeep shame and woe, rude blow on blow,\nEndured for us, Immanuel!", "3 But oh, what grief, what agony,\nWhen wrathful judgment's awful spell\nBurst over Thee on Calv'ry's tree,\nGod's Lamb for us, Immanuel!", "4 Arisen radiant from the dead,\nThy sorrow's scars forever tell,\nCreation's Head is He who bled-\nStill Jesus, still Immanuel!", "5 E'en now from saints, in concord sweet,\nCelestial strains of worship well;\nFor, O, 'tis meet glad songs should greet\nThy heart of love, Immanuel!", "6 But when Thy glorious face we see,\nHow shall the bursting paean swell!\nOur souls shall be outpoured for Thee-\nOutpoured for Thee, Immanuel!"]
