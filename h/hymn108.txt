{"1": ""Man of Sorrows," what a name
For the Son of God who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim!
Hallelujah! what a Savior!",
"2": "Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
In my place condemned He stood;
Sealed my pardon with His blood;
Hallelujah! what a Savior!",
"3": "Guilty, vile, and helpless, we,
Spotless Lamb of God was He;
Full redemption-can it be?
Hallelujah! what a Savior!",
"4": "Lifted up was He to die,
"It is finished!" was His cry;
Now in heaven exalted high;
Hallelujah! what a Savior!",
"5": "When He comes, our glorious King,
To His kingdom us to bring,
Then anew this song we'll sing
Hallelujah! what a Savior!"}
