["1 \"Man of Sorrows,\" what a name\nFor the Son of God who came\nRuined sinners to reclaim!\nHallelujah! what a Savior!", "2 Bearing shame and scoffing rude,\nIn my place condemned He stood;\nSealed my pardon with His blood;\nHallelujah! what a Savior!", "3 Guilty, vile, and helpless, we,\nSpotless Lamb of God was He;\nFull redemption-can it be?\nHallelujah! what a Savior!", "4 Lifted up was He to die,\n\"It is finished!\" was His cry;\nNow in heaven exalted high;\nHallelujah! what a Savior!", "5 When He comes, our glorious King,\nTo His kingdom us to bring,\nThen anew this song we'll sing\nHallelujah! what a Savior!"]
