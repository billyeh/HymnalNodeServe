["1 Once I thirsted for a fountain,\nSomething deep that would satisfy,\nBut the fountain that I'd drink from,\nLeft me searching and still so dry.\nThen one day I found Him,\nHe satisfied my thirst,\nBecame in me a deeper source\nWhence living waters burst.\nNow I drink Him!\nJesus, Jesus is my life now,\nJesus, Jesus is my life;\nI'm fully satisfied now,\nJesus, Jesus is my life.", "2 After tasting such a fountain,\nLonged my heart for a place of springs;\nCaught a vision on a mountain,\nIn Jerusalem's a gathering.\nThen one day He found me,\nHe brought me to the church,\nPleasures here abound fore'er\nI've given up my search.\nHallelujah!\nJesus, Jesus is my life now,\nJesus, Jesus is my life;\nI'm fully satisfied now,\nJesus, Jesus is my life.", "3 Empty wanderer drop the striving-\nIsn't worth all the troublin';\nOpen up your heart believing,\nCall \"Lord Jesus\" and He'll come in!\nThen today you'll find Him,\nAnd calling on His name,\nYou're joined to Him, you're one with Him-\nYou'll never be the same.\nYou won't want to!\nJesus, Jesus is my life now,\nJesus, Jesus is my life;\nI'm fully satisfied now,\nJesus, Jesus is my life."]
