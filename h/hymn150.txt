{"1": "Praise, praise ye the name of our Savior and God;
Declare, oh, declare ye His glories abroad;
Proclaim ye His mercy, from nation to nation,
Till the uttermost islands have heard His salvation.",
"chorus": "For His love floweth on, free and full as a river;
And His mercy endureth forever and ever.",
"2": "Praise, praise ye the Lamb, who for sinners was slain;
Who went down to the grave, and ascended again;
And who soon shall return, when these dark days are o'er,
To set up His kingdom, in glory and power.",
"3": "Then the heav'ns and the earth, and the sea shall rejoice;
The field and the forest shall lift their glad voice;
The sands of the desert shall flourish in green,
And Lebanon's glory be shed o'er the scene.",
"4": "Her bridal attire, and her festal array,
All nature shall see on that glorious day;
For her King cometh down with His people to reign,
And His presence shall bless her with glory in men."}
