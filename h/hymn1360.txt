{"1": "Oh, how glorious! Oh, how precious!
Now the Spirit dwells in me.
Life imparting, truth revealing,
Shining, leading constantly.",
"chorus": "Fill me now! Fill me now!
Fill me with Thy Spirit now!
Strip me wholly, empty thoroughly,
Fill me with Thy Spirit now!",
"2": "Word of promise, real within me,
Life divine now freeing me-
From sin's cruel control releasing,
From death's power setting free.",
"3": "Deepest springs of life dispensing,
Like the hart I thirst for Thee;
Desp'rate, may I drink Thy fullness,
'Till Thy river flows through me.",
"4": "May my self be put to death, Lord,
Under Thy control I'd be,
Transformed to Thy living image,
I'd forever flow out Thee."}
