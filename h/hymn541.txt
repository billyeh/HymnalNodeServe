{"1": "Not the law of letters
But the Christ of life,
God desires to give us
Saving us from strife;
It is not some doctrine
But 'tis Christ Himself,
Who alone releases,
From our sinful self.",
"2": "Any kind of teaching
Any kind of form
Cannot quicken spirits,
Or our souls transform;
It is Christ as Spirit,
Gives us life divine
Thus thru us to live the,
Life of God's design.",
"3": "Not philosophy nor,
Any element,
Can to Christ conform us,
As His complement;
But 'tis Christ Himself who,
All our nature takes,
And in resurrection,
Us His members makes.",
"4": "Not religion, even,
Christianity
Can fulfill God's purpose,
Or economy;
But 'tis Christ within us,
As our all in all,
Satisfies God's wishes
And His plan withal.",
"5": "All the gifts we're given,
By the Lord in grace
All the different functions,
Cannot Christ replace.
Only Christ Himself must,
Be our all in all!
Only Christ Himself in,
All things; great or small!"}
