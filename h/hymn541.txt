["1 Not the law of letters\nBut the Christ of life,\nGod desires to give us\nSaving us from strife;\nIt is not some doctrine\nBut 'tis Christ Himself,\nWho alone releases,\nFrom our sinful self.", "2 Any kind of teaching\nAny kind of form\nCannot quicken spirits,\nOr our souls transform;\nIt is Christ as Spirit,\nGives us life divine\nThus thru us to live the,\nLife of God's design.", "3 Not philosophy nor,\nAny element,\nCan to Christ conform us,\nAs His complement;\nBut 'tis Christ Himself who,\nAll our nature takes,\nAnd in resurrection,\nUs His members makes.", "4 Not religion, even,\nChristianity\nCan fulfill God's purpose,\nOr economy;\nBut 'tis Christ within us,\nAs our all in all,\nSatisfies God's wishes\nAnd His plan withal.", "5 All the gifts we're given,\nBy the Lord in grace\nAll the different functions,\nCannot Christ replace.\nOnly Christ Himself must,\nBe our all in all!\nOnly Christ Himself in,\nAll things; great or small!"]
