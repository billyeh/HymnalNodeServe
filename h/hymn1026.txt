{"1": "Today the Savior calls;
Ye wand'rers come:
O ye benighted souls!
Why longer roam?",
"2": "Today the Savior calls;
O hear Him now!
Before your day is gone,
To Jesus bow.",
"3": "Today the Savior calls;
For refuge fly;
The storm of vengeance falls,
And death is nigh.",
"4": "The Spirit calls today;
Yield to His pow'r;
O grieve Him not away,
'Tis mercy's hour!"}
