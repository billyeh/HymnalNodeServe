["1 Far away the noise of strife upon my ear is falling,\nThen I know the sins of earth beset on every hand;\nDoubt and fear and things of earth in vain to me are calling,\nNone of these shall move me from Beulah Land.", "chorus I'm living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,\nI'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry;\nO yes, I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,\nFor I am dwelling in Beulah Land.", "2 Far below the storm of doubt upon the world is beating,\nSons of men in battle long the enemy withstand;\nSafe am I within the castle of God's word retreating,\nNothing then can reach me, 'tis Beulah Land.", "3 Let the stormy breezes blow, their cry cannot alarm me,\nI am safely sheltered here, protected by God's hand;\nHere the sun is always shining, here there's naught can harm me,\nI am safe forever in Beulah Land.", "4 Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation,\nHearing now His blessed voice, I see the way is planned;\nDwelling in the spirit, here I learn of full salvation,\nGladly will I tarry in Beulah Land."]
