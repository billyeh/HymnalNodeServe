{"1": "Jesus has loved me, wonderful Savior!
Jesus has loved me, I cannot tell why;
Came He to rescue sinners all worthless;
My heart He conquered, for Him I would die.",
"chorus": "Glory to Jesus, wonderful Savior!
Glory to Jesus, the One I adore;
Glory to Jesus, wonderful Savior!
Glory to Jesus, and praise evermore.",
"2": "Jesus has saved me, wonderful Savior!
Jesus has saved me, I cannot tell how;
All that I know is He was my ransom,
Dying on Calv'ry with thorns on His brow.",
"3": "Jesus will lead me, wonderful Savior!
Jesus will lead me, I cannot tell where;
But I will follow, through joy or sorrow,
Sunshine or tempest, sweet peace or despair.",
"4": "Jesus will crown me, wonderful Savior!
Jesus will crown me, I cannot tell when;
His throne of splendor hail I with gladness,
Crowned with the glory of God among men."}
