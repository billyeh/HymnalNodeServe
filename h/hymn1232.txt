{"1": "Once by nature we were dead in sin,
In a world of utter discord;
But together God has quickened us,
Raised us up to sit together with the Lord.",
"chorus": "Jesus is getting us together,
Come and see the saints in one accord.
His love is knitting us together,
To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.",
"2": "Thus with all saints we can apprehend
All the vast dimensions of God.
Knowing Christ's love passes all we know,
We're together filled to fullness with our God.",
"3": "Now we know the purpose of our God,
Visible the mystery became:
Christ, the church, together now we see,
And together put the enemy to shame.",
"4": "For this cause we pray the Father God-
Strengthen Thou with might our inner man;
Make Yourself at home in all our hearts,
Root us, ground us in Your love and for Your plan.",
"5": "In the Body we'll be fitly framed
As the many members Christ supply;
Working in the measure of each part,
All by growth in love the Body edify.",
"6": "Now we're one His purpose to fulfill,
As the one new man of His plan.
Unto Him be glory in the church,
And in Jesus Christ forevermore-Amen!"}
