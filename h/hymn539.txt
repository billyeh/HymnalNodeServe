{"1": "O Lord, Thou art in me as life,
And everything to me!
Subjective and available
Thus I experience Thee.",
"chorus": "O Lord, Thou art the Spirit!
How dear and near to me!
How I admire Thy marvelous,
Availability!",
"2": "To all my needs both great and small,
Thou art the rich supply;
So ready and sufficient too,
For me now to apply.",
"3": "Thy sweet anointing with Thy might,
In weakness doth sustain;
By Thy supply of energy,
My strength Thou dost maintain.",
"4": "Thy law of life in heart and mind,
My conduct regulates;
The wealth of Thy reality,
My being saturates.",
"5": "O Thou art ever one with me
Unrivaled unity!
One spirit with me all the time,
For all eternity!"}
