{"1": "There's a little word that the Lord has giv'n
For our help in the hour of need:
Let us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin,
To be dead and dead indeed.",
"chorus": "Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
Let us reckon, rather than feel;
Let us be true to the reck'ning,
And He will make it real.",
"2": "There's another word that the Lord has giv'n,
In the very same verse we read,
Let us reckon ourselves as alive in Him,
As alive and alive indeed.",
"3": "While we trust in feeling or inward frames
We shall always be tossed about,
Let us anchor fast to the Word of God,
And reckon away our doubt.",
"4": "As the mariner, when the skies are dim.
Sails on by his compass true;
So our faith would cling to the promise firm.
And reckon the journey through.",
"5": "O how sweet it is to be anchored fast
To a hope that can never fail;
Let us reckon on with a firmer trust,
Till we anchor within the veil.",
"6": "You may claim the promise from every pain,
You may know His power to heal;
But your faith must rest in His word alone,
And reckon, rather than feel."}
