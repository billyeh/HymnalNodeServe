{"1": "My heart is hungry, my spirit doth thirst;
I come to Thee, Lord, to seek Thy supply;
All that I need is none other but Thee
Thou canst my hunger and thirst satisfy.",
"chorus": "Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.",
"2": "Thou art the food and the water of life
Thou canst revive me, my spirit upbear;
I long to eat and to drink here of Thee
Thyself enjoy through my reading and prayer.",
"3": "Thou art the Word with God's fulness in Thee
Thou too the Spirit that God my life be;
Thee in the Word I enjoy as my food
Thou as the Spirit art water to me.",

Thou to be drink hast been smitten for me;
Thou as the food, my exhaustless supply
Thou as the water, a stream unto me.",

Thus by the Word I may feed upon Thee;
Thou dost as Spirit in my spirit live
Thus I may drink in the spirit of Thee.",

On Thee to feed till my hunger is o'er.
Now in my spirit I turn unto Thee
Of Thee to drink till I'm thirsty no more.",
"7": "Feeding and drinking, Lord Jesus, of Thee
Feeding by reading, and drinking by prayer;
Reading and praying, I eat and I drink
Praying and reading-Lord, Thou art my fare.",
"8": "Here, O my Lord, may I feast upon Thee;
Flood with Thy Spirit and fill by Thy Word;
May, Lord, Thou be such a feast unto me,
As man hath never enjoyed nor e'er heard."}
