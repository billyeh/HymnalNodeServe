["1 Jesus, lover of my soul,\nLet me to Thy bosom fly,\nWhile the nearer waters roll,\nWhile the tempest still is high:\nHide me, O my Savior, hide,\nTill the storm of life is past;\nSafe into the haven guide;\nO receive my soul at last.", "2 Other refuge have I none,\nHangs my helpless soul on Thee;\nLeave, oh, leave me not alone,\nStill support and comfort me.\nAll my trust on Thee is stayed,\nAll my help from Thee I bring;\nCover my defenseless head\nWith the shadow of Thy wing.", "3 Thou, O Christ, art all I want;\nMore than all in Thee I find;\nRaise the fallen, cheer the faint,\nHeal the sick and lead the blind.\nJust and holy is Thy name,\nI am all unrighteousness;\nVile and full of sin I am,\nThou art full of truth and grace.", "4 Plenteous grace with Thee is found,\nGrace to cover all my sin;\nLet the healing streams abound;\nMake and keep me pure within.\nThou of life the fountain art,\nFreely let me take of Thee;\nSpring Thou up within my heart,\nRise to all eternity."]
