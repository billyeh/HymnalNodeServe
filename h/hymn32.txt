["1 We bow and worship, Father, here,\nAnd marvel at Thy wondrous love.\nO what is man that Thou shouldst deign,\nTo him such boundless grace to prove!", "2 We praise Thee for Thy heart's intent,\nThat man Thy likeness should possess\nThat with Thy life and nature filled,\nThine image he should manifest.", "3 Man in Thine image Thou didst make\nTo him authority didst give;\nThyself presenting as his life\nThat by Thy riches he might live.", "4 To enter man Thou dost desire\nWith him to mingle thru Thy grace\nThat man may be transformed and built,\nTo be Thy worthy dwelling place.", "5 Tho' man did fall, Thou didst not leave,\nThy heart's intent, but Thou didst move;\nRedeeming man to bring him back\nThou didst Thy love and wisdom prove.", "6 In Christ Thou didst Thyself reveal\nWho died and rose, redemption wrought;\nIn Spirit Thou hast entered man,\nAnd to him life and grace hast brought.", "7 My spirit is Thy holiest place\nThy throne of grace is founded there;\nThou wouldst that we in spirit come,\nTo burn the incense thru our prayer.", "8 Such grace is like a river full,\nWhich from the throne of grace doth come;\nIt floweth thru, transforming us\nAnd builds us up to be Thy home.", "9 Receiving of Thy matchless grace\nWe marvel at Thy gift so free;\nWith grateful hearts for Thy great love\nIn spirit now we worship Thee."]
