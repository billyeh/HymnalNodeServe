{"1": "We bow and worship, Father, here,
And marvel at Thy wondrous love.
O what is man that Thou shouldst deign,
To him such boundless grace to prove!",
"2": "We praise Thee for Thy heart's intent,
That man Thy likeness should possess
That with Thy life and nature filled,
Thine image he should manifest.",
"3": "Man in Thine image Thou didst make
To him authority didst give;
Thyself presenting as his life
That by Thy riches he might live.",
"4": "To enter man Thou dost desire
With him to mingle thru Thy grace
That man may be transformed and built,
To be Thy worthy dwelling place.",
"5": "Tho' man did fall, Thou didst not leave,
Thy heart's intent, but Thou didst move;
Redeeming man to bring him back
Thou didst Thy love and wisdom prove.",
"6": "In Christ Thou didst Thyself reveal
Who died and rose, redemption wrought;
In Spirit Thou hast entered man,
And to him life and grace hast brought.",
"7": "My spirit is Thy holiest place
Thy throne of grace is founded there;
Thou wouldst that we in spirit come,
To burn the incense thru our prayer.",
"8": "Such grace is like a river full,
Which from the throne of grace doth come;
It floweth thru, transforming us
And builds us up to be Thy home.",
"9": "Receiving of Thy matchless grace
We marvel at Thy gift so free;
With grateful hearts for Thy great love
In spirit now we worship Thee."}
