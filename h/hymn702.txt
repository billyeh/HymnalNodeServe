{"1": "'Tis now in part I know His grace;
I catch sweet glimpses of His face,
But in that better world of His,
I shall behold Him as He is.",
"chorus": "Then shall I know as I am known,
And sing His praise before the throne;
Then shall I know as I am known,
And sing His praise before the throne.",
"2": "'Tis now in part I know His love;
Bright sunbeams shine from skies above;
But glories more exceeding far,
Shall rise beyond life's evening star.",
"3": "'Tis now in part I understand
The leadings of my Father's hand;
But I shall own His ways were right,
When welcomed to His presence bright.",
"4": "'Tis now in part, but O how sweet
To rest by faith at His dear feet;
Though now we see as through a glass,
The veil will lift, the shadows pass."}
