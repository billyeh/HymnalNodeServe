["1 'Tis now in part I know His grace;\nI catch sweet glimpses of His face,\nBut in that better world of His,\nI shall behold Him as He is.", "chorus Then shall I know as I am known,\nAnd sing His praise before the throne;\nThen shall I know as I am known,\nAnd sing His praise before the throne.", "2 'Tis now in part I know His love;\nBright sunbeams shine from skies above;\nBut glories more exceeding far,\nShall rise beyond life's evening star.", "3 'Tis now in part I understand\nThe leadings of my Father's hand;\nBut I shall own His ways were right,\nWhen welcomed to His presence bright.", "4 'Tis now in part, but O how sweet\nTo rest by faith at His dear feet;\nThough now we see as through a glass,\nThe veil will lift, the shadows pass."]
