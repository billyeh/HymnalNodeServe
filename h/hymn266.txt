{"1": "Divine anointing in me dwelleth
And it teaches me all things;
It ever leads me in the Lord to live,
And to me His presence brings.",
"chorus": "In my spirit the anointing dwells
O the anointing dwells and,
teaches everything;
In my spirit the anointing dwells,
And ever teaches everything.",
"2": "It is the moving of the Spirit,
Gracious as the ointment pure;
'Tis based upon the sprinkling of the blood
And it ever shall endure.",
"3": "With God's own essence it anoints me
God to know subjectively
That I may have His very element,
Fully saturating me.",
"4": "'Tis by this inner life-anointing,
I in fellowship may move;
In God, the light of truth, I'm walking
And the love of grace I prove."}
