["1 Sun of my soul, Thou Savior dear,\nIt is not night if Thou be near;\nOh, may no earthborn cloud arise\nTo hide Thee from Thy servant's eyes.", "2 When the soft dews of kindly sleep\nMy wearied eyelids gently steep,\nBe my last thought how sweet to rest\nForever on my Savior's breast.", "3 Abide with me from morn till eve,\nFor without Thee I cannot live;\nAbide with me when night is nigh,\nFor without Thee I dare not die.", "4 Come near, and bless us when we wake,\nEre through the world our way we take;\nTill in the ocean of Thy love\nWe lose ourselves in Thee above."]
