["1 Lord, how can man e'er preach Thy Word?\nHe is a brittle, crazy glass;\nYet in Thy temple is conferred\nThis glorious and transcendent place,\nTo be a window through Thy grace.", "2 But when Thou dost anneal Thy story\nIn glass, Thy life to shine within\nThe holy preachers, light of glory\nMore radiant grows and more doth win,\nWhich else shows waterish, bleak, and thin.", "3 The life and doctrine blent in one\nAs light and color mingled, bring\nA strong regard; but speech alone\nDoth vanish like a flaring thing,\nAnd in the ear, not spirit ring."]
