{"1": "Lord, how can man e'er preach Thy Word?
He is a brittle, crazy glass;
Yet in Thy temple is conferred
This glorious and transcendent place,
To be a window through Thy grace.",
"2": "But when Thou dost anneal Thy story
In glass, Thy life to shine within
The holy preachers, light of glory
More radiant grows and more doth win,
Which else shows waterish, bleak, and thin.",
"3": "The life and doctrine blent in one
As light and color mingled, bring
A strong regard; but speech alone
Doth vanish like a flaring thing,
And in the ear, not spirit ring."}
