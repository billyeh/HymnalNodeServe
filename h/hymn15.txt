{"1": "O God, Thou art transcendent
The Holy One Thou art!
None other is Thine equal
Incomp'rable Thou art!
The holiest of the holy,
The universe may call!
Thy power and Thy nature,
Do far exceed it all!",
"2": "Distinct, unique, and holy
Not only right and pure;
Not only without defect
But with perfection more;
For nothing can approach Thee
Nor e'er Thine equal be;
If aught Thy place hath taken
'Tis insult unto Thee.",
"3": "The excellent excelling
The fairest of the fair
Yet differing from the finest
For none with Thee compare.
From all the righteous different
For Thine is absolute;
None beauteous with Thee vying
For Thine excels repute.",
"4": "Thy holiness transcendent,
Thou hast for us prepared
And this distinctive nature,
We have already shared.
We share in Thy transcendence
Since we Thy nature own;
Thy holy life we follow,
Till unto fulness grown.",
"5": "We give Thee praise and worship,
For all Thy holiness
For Thy transcendent nature
Thine utter peerlessness.
We praise Thee that Thy nature,
Unique, distinct-we share;
This separating nature,
Is ours now and fore'er."}
