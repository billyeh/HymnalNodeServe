{"1": "There is sunshine in my soul today,
More glorious and bright
Than glows in any earthly sky,
For Jesus is my light.",
"chorus": "O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,
While the peaceful, happy moments roll;
When Jesus shows His smiling face
There is sunshine in my soul.",
"2": "There is music in my soul today,
A carol to my King;
And Jesus, listening, can hear
The song I cannot sing.",
"3": "There is springtime in my soul today,
For when the Lord is near
The dove of peace sings in my heart,
The flowers of grace appear.",
"4": "There is gladness in my soul today,
And hope, and praise, and love,
For blessings which He gives me now,
For joys laid up above."}
