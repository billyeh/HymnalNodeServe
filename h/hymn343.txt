["1 There is sunshine in my soul today,\nMore glorious and bright\nThan glows in any earthly sky,\nFor Jesus is my light.", "chorus O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,\nWhile the peaceful, happy moments roll;\nWhen Jesus shows His smiling face\nThere is sunshine in my soul.", "2 There is music in my soul today,\nA carol to my King;\nAnd Jesus, listening, can hear\nThe song I cannot sing.", "3 There is springtime in my soul today,\nFor when the Lord is near\nThe dove of peace sings in my heart,\nThe flowers of grace appear.", "4 There is gladness in my soul today,\nAnd hope, and praise, and love,\nFor blessings which He gives me now,\nFor joys laid up above."]
