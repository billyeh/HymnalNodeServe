{"1": "Light after darkness,
Gain after loss,
Strength after weakness
Crown after cross;
Sweet after bitter,
Hope after fears,
Home after wand'ring,
Praise after tears.",
"2": "Sheaves after sowing,
Sun after rain,
Sight after mystery,
Peace after pain;
Joy after sorrow,
Calm after blast,
Rest after weariness,
Sweet rest at last.",
"3": "Near after distant,
Gleam after gloom,
Love after loneliness,
Life after tomb;
After long agony,
Rapture of bliss,
Right was the pathway,
Leading to this."}
