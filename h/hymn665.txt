["1 Come, let us to the Lord our God\nWith contrite heart return;\nOur God is gracious, nor will leave\nThe desolate to mourn.", "2 His voice commands the tempest forth,\nAnd stills the stormy wave;\nAnd though His arm be strong to smite,\n'Tis also strong to save.", "3 Long hath the night of sorrow reigned;\nThe dawn shall bring us light;\nGod shall appear, and we shall rise\nWith gladness in His sight.", "4 Our heart, if God we seek to know,\nShall know Him, and rejoice;\nHis coming like the morn shall be,\nLike morning songs His voice.", "5 As dew upon the tender herb,\nDiffusing fragrance round,\nAs showers that usher in the spring,\nAnd cheer the thirsty ground;", "6 So shall His presence bless our souls,\nAnd shed a joyful light;\nThat hallowed morn shall chase away\nThe sorrows of the night."]
