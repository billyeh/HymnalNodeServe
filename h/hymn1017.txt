{"1": "Christ has put on human nature and become,
a man like me
He has died upon the cross that I from Adam,
might be free
He has risen and as Spirit He has come,
to live in me,
That He might be my life.",
"chorus": "Glory! glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! glory! Hallelujah!
For Christ is now my life!",
"chorus": "Vict'ry! vict'ry! Hallelujah!
Vict'ry! vict'ry! Hallelujah!
Vict'ry! vict'ry! Hallelujah!
For Christ is now my all!"}
