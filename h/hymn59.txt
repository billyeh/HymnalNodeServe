{"1": "Thou art the everlasting Word,
The Father's only Son,
God manifestly seen and heard,
And heav'n's beloved One:
Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
In Thee God's fulness find we now.",
"2": "In Thee most perfectly expressed
The Father's glories shine;
Of the full Deity possessed,
Eternally divine:
Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
In Thee God's fulness find we now.",
"3": "True image of the Infinite,
Whose essence is concealed;
Brightness of uncreated light;
The heart of God revealed:
Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
In Thee God's fulness find we now.",
"4": "But the high mysteries of Thy Name
An angel's grasp transcend;
The Father only, glorious claim!
The Son can comprehend:
Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
In Thee God's fulness find we now.",
"5": "Throughout the universe of bliss,
The center, Thou, and sun;
Th' eternal theme of praise is this,
To heav'n's beloved One:
Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
In Thee God's fulness find we now."}
