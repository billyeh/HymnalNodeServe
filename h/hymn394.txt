["1 Unto him that hath Thou givest\nEver more abundantly;\nLord, I live because Thou livest,\nTherefore give more life to me,\nTherefore speed me in the race,\nTherefore let me grow in grace.", "2 Deepen all Thy work, O Master,\nStrengthen every downward root;\nOnly do Thou ripen faster,\nMore and more Thy pleasant fruit;\nPurge me, prune me, self abase;\nOnly let me grow in grace.", "3 Let me grow by sun and shower,\nEvery moment water me;\nMake me really, hour by hour,\nMore and more conformed to Thee,\nThat Thy loving eye may trace\nDay by day my growth in grace.", "4 From Thy fulness grace outpouring,\nShow me ever greater things;\nRaise me higher, sunward soaring,\nMounting as on eagle-wings.\nBy the brightness of Thy face,\nEver let me grow in grace.", "5 Let me, then, be always growing,\nNever, never standing still,\nListening, learning, better knowing\nThee and Thy most blessed will.\nTill I win the glorious race,\nDaily let me grow in grace."]
