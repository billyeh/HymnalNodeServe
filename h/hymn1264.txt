{"1": "In the age of Revelation,
Out from all denomination,
We are in the local churches,
In spirit one.
Nothing old or religious binds,
Everyone's a star that shines;
Every church a golden lampstand,
Burning with Christ.
Christ and a burning church,
Christ and a burning church,
Christ and the church with the saints,
all shining stars!
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Lord, we've given our all to Thee
To be burning in the spirit, to be
shining forth with Christ."}
