["1 In the age of Revelation,\nOut from all denomination,\nWe are in the local churches,\nIn spirit one.\nNothing old or religious binds,\nEveryone's a star that shines;\nEvery church a golden lampstand,\nBurning with Christ.\nChrist and a burning church,\nChrist and a burning church,\nChrist and the church with the saints,\nall shining stars!\nHallelujah, hallelujah,\nLord, we've given our all to Thee\nTo be burning in the spirit, to be\nshining forth with Christ."]
