{"1": "The law of letters God defines
It is His testimony true;
It shows how loving, holy, just
Is God, with whom we have to do.",
"2": "According to His nature shown,
God's law requires that we must live
That He our souls may justify,
And unto us His blessing give.",
"3": "The law can never give us life
Nor any strength to us supply
But doth its full demands exact,
And all our weakness show thereby.",
"4": "It was not for God's final plan
But for man's sin was introduced
That man by breaking it might know,
Himself, his sin to him adduced.",
"5": "'Tis by the law all mouths are stopped,
And all are shut up under sin;
It brings us to the Christ of God,
That God may bless us all in Him.",
"6": "The law is but a type of Christ
Who God's full testimony is
Who fully has expressed His love
His holiness and righteousness.",
"7": "'Tis Christ, God's testimony real
Who doth with life divine supply
That with the law's demands we may,
Be more than able to comply.",
"8": "God's living testimony, He;
By whom God's potent life we share;
Thru Him we're dead unto the law
And in His Spirit fruit we bear."}
