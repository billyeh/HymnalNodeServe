{"1": "God has not giv'n us a spirit of fear-
There's pow'r deep within, pow'r deep within!
We have His Word-brothers, sisters, let's hear-
That pow'r deep within may flow out.",
"chorus": "O there's pow'r, pow'r, overcoming pow'r,
Deep within, deep within;
O there's pow'r, pow'r, normal Christian pow'r
In the spirit God's given us!",
"2": "God has not giv'n us a wavering will-
There's pow'r deep within, pow'r deep within!
But one our spirit will strengthen and fill-
There's wonderful pow'r deep within!",
"3": "God has not giv'n us emotions so weak-
There's pow'r deep within, pow'r deep within!
Open our hearts and in love let us speak-
There's wonderful pow'r deep within!",
"4": "God has not giv'n us a mind that is bound-
There's pow'r deep within, pow'r deep within!
But one that's healthy and perfectly sound-
There's wonderful pow'r deep within!"}
