{"1": "O Lord, Thou art the Son of man
Our human nature Thou didst take;
Begotten of a virgin true
Of flesh and blood Thou didst partake.",
"2": "In bondman's form, with lowliness
Thou walkedst on this earth of woe;
The human living Thou didst have,
And all its suff'rings undergo.",
"3": "Born in a manger as a babe
Thou wast a child among the poor;
Thou as a carpenter didst work
And e'en an outlaw's death endure.",
"4": "Then Thou wast raised up from the dead
Still with the human nature true;
And as a man in form divine
Thou didst ascend to heaven too.",
"5": "Now over all, and on the throne
Thou, still a man, art glorified;
A man with God in light divine,
With whom our God is satisfied.",
"6": "In glory Thou wilt come again
Still as a man appearing then;
As King of kings, with pow'r divine
With human nature seen by men.",
"7": "Thou, as the center of all things
In the new heav'n and earth shalt be
Forever as the One divine
Existing in humanity."}
