["1 O Lord, Thou art the Son of man\nOur human nature Thou didst take;\nBegotten of a virgin true\nOf flesh and blood Thou didst partake.", "2 In bondman's form, with lowliness\nThou walkedst on this earth of woe;\nThe human living Thou didst have,\nAnd all its suff'rings undergo.", "3 Born in a manger as a babe\nThou wast a child among the poor;\nThou as a carpenter didst work\nAnd e'en an outlaw's death endure.", "4 Then Thou wast raised up from the dead\nStill with the human nature true;\nAnd as a man in form divine\nThou didst ascend to heaven too.", "5 Now over all, and on the throne\nThou, still a man, art glorified;\nA man with God in light divine,\nWith whom our God is satisfied.", "6 In glory Thou wilt come again\nStill as a man appearing then;\nAs King of kings, with pow'r divine\nWith human nature seen by men.", "7 Thou, as the center of all things\nIn the new heav'n and earth shalt be\nForever as the One divine\nExisting in humanity."]
