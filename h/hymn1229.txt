{"1": "The church is Christ's deep longing
And His good pleasure too.
His every word and action
Is made with her in view.
His heart's love is established,
And nought can Him deter;
Before the earth's foundation
His thoughts were filled with her.",
"2": "The eve of all creation
He mused on His delight,
And pondered every feature,
Well-pleasing in His sight.
Creation sprang to being,
But deep in Him did hide
A heart of depth unfathomed
Fixed on a glorious Bride.",
"3": "And thus His will was 'stablished
His counterpart to gain:
This blessed, firm intention,
Eternally the same.
Though sin should e'en beguile man,
Then mock his helpless state,
He never could forsake her,
His yearning ne'er abate.",
"4": "Then mercy richly flourished,
And love was, oh, so vast,
As graciously He sought her
With wisdom unsurpassed.
The love He gave to win her
God only comprehends!
His life laid down, an offering
Whose fragrance yet ascends.",
"5": "And now in resurrection
To her He draws most near,
And with untold affection
In glory does appear.
As she beholds her Bridegroom,
His glory floods her heart,
'Til she, His Bride, is raptured,
His longed-for counterpart."}
