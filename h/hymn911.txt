Christ to him is all in all:
All His clothing, food, and dwelling
And His portion therewithal.",

"2": "All the clothing of his service,
Is the beauty of the Lord;
Glorious splendor do his garments
Breast and shoulder-piece afford.",
"3": "When in sacrifice he offers,
Christ to God as God has willed
Then as food he doth enjoy Him,
And is with His riches filled.",
"4": "Putting on the Lord as clothing
Christ without he doth express;
Eating, drinking, with Him mingled
Christ within doth him possess.",

'Tis the increase of the Lord;
Here the priests built up together,
Unto God a house afford.",
"6": "All his portion, all his living
Everything the priests possess-
All is Christ and Christ forever
In His all-inclusiveness."}
