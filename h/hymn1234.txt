{"1": "I thirsted in the barren land of Babylon
And nothing satisfying there I found;
But to the blessed local church one day I came,
Where springs of living water do abound.",
"chorus": "Drinking at the springs of living water,
Happy now am I,
My heart they satisfy;
Drinking at the springs of living water,
O wonderful and bountiful supply!",
"2": "How sweet the living water from the hills of God,
It's flowing in and flowing out of me;
O now I've found the place for which I long had sought,
Where there is life and life abundantly.",
"3": "O brother, won't you gather in the local church?
A fountain here is flowing deep and wide.
The Shepherd now would bring you to the local church,
Where thirsty spirits can be satisfied."}
