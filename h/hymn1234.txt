["1 I thirsted in the barren land of Babylon\nAnd nothing satisfying there I found;\nBut to the blessed local church one day I came,\nWhere springs of living water do abound.", "chorus Drinking at the springs of living water,\nHappy now am I,\nMy heart they satisfy;\nDrinking at the springs of living water,\nO wonderful and bountiful supply!", "2 How sweet the living water from the hills of God,\nIt's flowing in and flowing out of me;\nO now I've found the place for which I long had sought,\nWhere there is life and life abundantly.", "3 O brother, won't you gather in the local church?\nA fountain here is flowing deep and wide.\nThe Shepherd now would bring you to the local church,\nWhere thirsty spirits can be satisfied."]
