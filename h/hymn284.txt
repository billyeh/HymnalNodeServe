["1 Loved with everlasting love,\nLed by grace that love to know;\nSpirit, breathing from above,\nThou hast taught me it is so.\nOh, this full and perfect peace!\nOh, this transport all divine!\nIn a love which cannot cease,\nI am His, and He is mine.", "2 Heaven above is softer blue,\nEarth around is sweeter green;\nSomething lives in every hue\nChristless eyes have never seen:\nBirds with gladder songs o'erflow,\nFlow'rs with deeper beauties shine,\nSince I know, as now I know,\nI am His, and He is mine.", "3 Things that once were wild alarms\nCannot now disturb my rest;\nClosed in everlasting arms,\nPillowed on the loving breast.\nOh, to lie forever here,\nDoubt and care and self resign,\nWhile He whispers in my ear,\nI am His, and He is mine.", "4 His forever, only His:\nWho the Lord and me shall part?\nAh, with what a rest of bliss\nChrist can fill the loving heart.\nHeaven and earth may fade and flee,\nFirstborn light in gloom decline;\nBut, while God and I shall be,\nI am His, and He is mine."]
