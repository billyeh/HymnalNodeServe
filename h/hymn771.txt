{"1": "The veil is rent and opened is,
A new and living way;
With boldness thru the precious blood
We come to Thee to pray.",
"2": "By Thy redemption we may come,
Into the holiest place;
Thy Spirit now anointing us
We touch the throne of grace.",
"3": "In spirit only we would pray
Ourselves by Thee possessed
That from our spirit Christ the Lord,
As incense be expressed.",
"4": "Thy grace and mercy as a stream,
From out the throne does flow
Refreshing in the hour of need-
How rich, how sweet to know!",
"5": "Though for our needs we do not ask,
But by Thy Spirit pray
Our every need is known to Thee
We're in Thy care alway.",
"6": "Though griefs and trials on us press
We will not anxious be
But all our care upon Thee cast,
And set our spirit free.",
"7": "O may I concentrated be,
In fellowship with Thee
My prayer and incense offering
Thy Spirit leading me."}
