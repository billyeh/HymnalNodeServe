["1 The veil is rent and opened is,\nA new and living way;\nWith boldness thru the precious blood\nWe come to Thee to pray.", "2 By Thy redemption we may come,\nInto the holiest place;\nThy Spirit now anointing us\nWe touch the throne of grace.", "3 In spirit only we would pray\nOurselves by Thee possessed\nThat from our spirit Christ the Lord,\nAs incense be expressed.", "4 Thy grace and mercy as a stream,\nFrom out the throne does flow\nRefreshing in the hour of need-\nHow rich, how sweet to know!", "5 Though for our needs we do not ask,\nBut by Thy Spirit pray\nOur every need is known to Thee\nWe're in Thy care alway.", "6 Though griefs and trials on us press\nWe will not anxious be\nBut all our care upon Thee cast,\nAnd set our spirit free.", "7 O may I concentrated be,\nIn fellowship with Thee\nMy prayer and incense offering\nThy Spirit leading me."]
