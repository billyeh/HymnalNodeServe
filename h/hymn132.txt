{"1": "Lo! in heaven Jesus sitting
Christ the Lord is there enthroned;
As the man by God exalted
With God's glory He is crowned.",
"2": "He hath put on human nature
Died according to God's plan
Resurrected with a body
And ascended as a man.",
"3": "God in Him on earth was humbled
God with man was domiciled;
Man in Him in heav'n exalted
Man with God is reconciled.",
"4": "He as God with man is mingled
God in man is testified;
He as man with God is blended
Man in God is glorified.",
"5": "From the Glorified in heaven,
The inclusive Spirit came;
All of Jesus' work and Person,
Doth this Spirit here proclaim.",
"6": "With the Glorified in heaven,
Is the Church identified;
By the Spirit of this Jesus,
Are His members edified.",
"7": "Lo! a man is now in heaven,
As the Lord of all enthroned;
This is Jesus Christ our Savior
With God's glory ever crowned!"}
