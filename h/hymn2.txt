{"1": "Glory, glory, glory, praise and adoration!
Hear the anthems swelling out thro' all eternity!
Father, Son, and Spirit-God in revelation-
Prostrate each soul before the Deity!",
"2": "Father, source of glory, naming every fam'ly;
And the Son upholding all by His almighty power;
Holy Spirit, filling the vast scene of glory-
O glorious Fulness, let our hearts adore!",
"3": "God supreme, we worship now in holy splendour,
Head of the vast scene of bliss, before Thy face we fall!
Majesty and greatness, glory, praise and power
To Thee belong, eternal Source of all!"}
