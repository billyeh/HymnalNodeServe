{"1": "Son of Man, Son of Man on the throne today;
Son of Man, Pioneer, He has led the way;
Following, how we sing, Jesus leads us on;
We are marching with the Victor to the throne.",
"2": "On we go, on we go to the throne with Him;
On we go through this age, age so dark and grim;
Then shall we-formerly, Satan's captured ones-
Be exalted with the Lord upon His throne.",
"3": "Called as sons, called as sons, destined to be kings;
Called as sons we've no time for the worldly things:
Yet we know, it is so-we don't qualify!
Thus the Lord must search and burn and purify.",
"4": "Search and burn, search and burn all our inward parts;
Search and burn, thoroughly, to refine our hearts;
We'll not fear, but be clear-burning, searching thus
Is the gracious visit of the Lord to us.",
"5": "With the Man, with the Man is a rainbow fair;
Glorious bow, 'round the throne, faithfulness declares:
We deserved to be served with God's judgment sore,
But we have been spared to praise Him more and more."}
