{"1": ""Come and dine," the Lord is calling,
"Come and dine"-
We can eat and drink of Jesus all the time!
He's our daily food supply,
Only He can satisfy.
"Come and dine," the Lord is calling,
"Come and dine."",
"2": ""Come and dine," the Lord is calling,
"Come and dine."
When we eat and drink of Jesus all the time,
He becomes our life within,
And He fills us to the brim.
"Come and dine," the Lord is calling,
"Come and dine.""}
