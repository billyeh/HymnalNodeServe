{"1": ""No condemnation!" precious word!
Consider it, my soul!
Thy sins were all on Jesus laid,
His stripes have made thee whole.",
"2": "In God's own presence now for us
The Savior doth appear;
The saints, as jewels on His heart,
Jesus doth ever bear.",
"3": ""No condemnation!" O my soul,
'Tis God that speaks the word;
Perfect in comeliness art thou
In Christ, the risen Lord.",
"4": "Teach me, O God, to fix mine eyes
On Christ, the spotless Lamb,
So shall I love Thy precious will,
And glorify His name."}
