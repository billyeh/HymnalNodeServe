{"1": "We praise Thee, Lord, for Thy great plan,
That we Thy dwelling-place may be;
Thou live in us, we filled with Thee
Thou in the Son expressed might be.",
"2": "Though in Thine image made by Thee,
And given Thine authority
Yet we are only made of clay,
Without a trace of divinity.",
"3": "When we receive Thee as our life
Thy nature we thru grace possess;
Mingled together, we with Thee,
One Body glorious will express.",
"4": "When flows Thy life thru all our souls
Filling, renewing every part
We will be pearls and precious stones
Changed to Thine image, as Thou art.",
"5": "But, Lord, we fully realize,
These are not wrought men's praise to rouse
But as material to be built,
Together for Thy glorious house.",
"6": "Here, Lord, we give ourselves to Thee;
Receive us into Thy wise hands;
Bend, break, and build together in Thee,
To be the house to meet Thy demands.",
"7": "Break all the natural life for us
Deal Thou with each peculiar way
That we no more independent be,
But with all saints are one for aye.",
"8": "Then we shall be Thy Bride beloved
Together in Thy chamber abide
Enjoy the fulness of Thy love.
How Thou wilt then be satisfied!"}
