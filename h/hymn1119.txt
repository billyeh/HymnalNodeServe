{"1": "In the Word of God I found it,
Wonderful this Word to me;
I need not man's natural teaching,
The anointing lives in me!",
"chorus": "Yes, in my spirit now He is moving!
Yes, I have the anointing!
God in me is flowing!
Thank God, I see it!
His Word revealed it!
I will apply it ever!
The anointing lives in me!",
"2": "Making Christ experiential,
God at His pure Word I take;
As the Spirit joined unto me,
He cannot His promise break.",
"3": "Based upon the blood that cleanses
So that nothing stands between,
Christ, the ointment, moves within me!
For His move I'm made so clean.",
"4": "God in Christ as life in Spirit
Into my own spirit came!
He the Holy One anoints me
Till in spirit we're the same.",
"5": "God in Spirit; I can touch Him;
In my spirit He's the flow.
Deeper, wider, richer, fuller-
Oh, the very God I know!",
"6": "As I heed "that same anointing"
Ever to "abide in Him,"
He is teaching, He is reaching,
Even all my heart to win."}
