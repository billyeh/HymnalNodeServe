["1 Of the Spirit, born of Spirit-\nThis the source of Jesus is;\nFilled with Spirit, all of Spirit-\nThis the essence truly His.\nIn the Spirit, with the Spirit,\nAs the Spirit Jesus came;\nNow the Lord is just that Spirit\nAnd in spirit we're the same.", "2 Baptized in the Holy Spirit,\nIn the Spirit we're immersed;\nAll the church is born of Spirit,\nAll religion is dispersed.\nIn the Spirit, in the Spirit-\nBrothers, this is all we need.\nNow the church must be in Spirit,\nNot in teaching, form, or creed.", "3 The communion of the Spirit\nIs the fellowship we share;\nAll the brothers, all the sisters\nOnly for the Spirit care.\nNow the Spirit in the churches\nSpeaks to those who have an ear.\nSeven Spirits for the churches\nAre our blessed portion here.", "4 \"Come and drink the living water,\"\nSay the Spirit and the Bride-\nChurch and Spirit speak together,\nUtterly identified.\nJust according to the Spirit\nMust be our reality;\nJust the Spirit in the churches\nIs the Lord's recovery."]
