{"1": "We're in the land, we're in the land!
O Hallelujah! In the land!
Christ is the land, Christ is the land,
O praise the Lord, He is the land!",
"chorus": "He is the milk and honey, too;
The grain, the oil, the wine so new.
We're in the land! We're in the land!
O Hallelujah! In the land!",
"2": "This land includes so many things:
Wheat, barley, vines, deep-flowing springs,
Fig trees and never-failing bread-
O what a land before us spread!",
"chorus": "To have the produce and abound
We daily labor on the ground;
Then to the meetings we will bring
The topmost Christ, our offering!"}
