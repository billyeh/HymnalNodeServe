{"1": "Go to Him "without the camp,
His reproach to gladly bear.
Suffered He without the gate
How can I in comfort share?",
"2": "Go to Him "without the camp,
Willing e'en to bear the cross;
He has trod the narrow way
I will follow, suff'ring loss.",
"3": "Go to Him "without the camp,
Dear ones, relatives forsake;
He the Father's will did mind
In His passion I partake.",
"4": "Go to Him "without the camp,
His companion I will be;
Never join religion's ranks,
Or the world's society.",
"5": "Go to Him "without the camp,
Though the path be lone and grim;
Let all human friends desert
I am satisfied with Him.",
"6": "Go to Him "without the camp,
There to walk with Him, how blest!
E'er to see His smiling face,
Ever in His presence rest.",
"7": "Go to Him "without the camp,
Till the dawning of the day;
Then I'll see Him and rejoice
With Him in His kingdom stay."}
