Hymnal Node Server
==================
This site was originally intended to serve as the backend for an Android app that would serve hymns to client smartphones.

Though this app was never meant to become a full-blown project (since the concepts and application aren't really that interesting), I've kind of grown into it, and the site is no longer just a backend.

I've documented the creation of this site, along with the rest of the app, at [hymn.aws.af.cm](http://hymn.aws.af.cm). The original functionality is still preserved - if you're interested, a query to, for example, [hymn?hymn=N&type=ns](hymn.aws.af.cm/hymn?hymn=5&type=ns) will give you a JSON string of the song.
