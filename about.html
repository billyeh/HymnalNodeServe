    <h1>about this project, and myself</h1>
    <h2>why this project?</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project was to create an Android application that would display hymns. These hymns were copyrighted and printed in a book, titled <i>Hymns</i>, published by the Living Stream Ministry, and were generously put online at <a href="http://www.hymnal.net" target="_blank">hymnal.net</a>. There is also a mobile download already available, a .epub file that can be read by the <a href="http://www.isilo.com/">iSilo</a> reader.</p>
    <p>I wanted a project to work on during my first semester at UC Berkeley, and I wanted to experiment with scraping websites and displaying them on client screens like smartphones compactly. I imagined that this could be applied to other websites as well, such as <a href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com" target="_blank">Ultimate Guitar</a>. My reasoning was that a website should not have a free, ad-supported site which can be viewed by a mobile device any time, but force user to buy an app to use it more conveniently.</p>
    <p>Though I've now realized that there's no way that a website-scraping app that displays the content of webpages would never fly with copyright rules, I still learned a lot from this application's development.</p>
    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>I strongly believe that any code from this site would really only be useful to anyone who also has the same background as I do, just as I've found through my reading of other tutorials on the web. That's why I'm describing my coding background.</p>
    <p>This documentation pretty much assumes that you're extremely comfortable with Python already, and thus the scripts from Python are sparsely explained. Furthermore, I've taken a class in HTML and I know CSS decently well. Javascript is still a mystery to me, since I've had no formal introduction to it, but having studied Python for a while, I obviously understand some concepts (like higher order functions). I took a Java class a while back, before I knew any programming, and I didn't learn that much from it. That's about it.</p>
