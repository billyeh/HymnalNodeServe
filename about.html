    <h1 id="step1">About This Project</h1>
      <p>The goal of this project was to create an Android application that would display hymns.</p>
      <p>In the end, this would involve downloading and parsing 1,885 web pages for the relevant song content, and serving them through a website to a client application, along with storing them in an SQLite database to allow searching. I basically created an API for the site from scratch, implementing a RESTful service for mobile app consumption.</p>
      <p><i>But why would we need all that? </i> The hymns are available for free at <a href="http://www.hymnal.net" target="_blank">hymnal.net</a>. There is also a mobile download already available, an epub file that can be read by the <a href="http://www.isilo.com/">iSilo</a> reader.</p>
      <p>Simple: the website was a pain to use on smartphones, and the iSilo option cost an arm and a leg. It's my philosophy that a website with free content should not force users to buy an app to use it more conveniently on a smartphone. (Hymnal.net was not the only one guilty of this. My next target was originally going to be <a href="http://ultimateguitar.com">UltimateGuitar</a>.)</p>
      <p>I've now realized that a website-scraping app that displays the content of webpages would never fly with copyright rules. But even as I saw that my app would never be published, I noticed how hymnal.net changed its site from the original clunky design to the current, <i>mobile-friendly</i> design. And I now have hope that in due time, the Web will become smartphone friendly, driven as it is by the market. But I also hope that I'll be able to be a part of that transition.</p>
    <h1 id="step2">But What About the Website?</h1>
    <p>I developed this website myself during my first semester at Berkeley, since I'd been looking to get into web development for a while. I fell in love with jQuery, and realized that documentation of my project would solidify my understanding and serve as a reminder for future projects.</p>
    <p>Thus, this site is not meant for others, at least in the traditional sense. SEO interests me, but I have no chance of discovery as a resource to others as it now stands, with an obscure domain name provided by free hosting.</p>
