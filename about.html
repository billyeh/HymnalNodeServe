    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>The simple goal of this project was to create an Android application that would display hymns.</p>
    <p>In the end, this would involve downloading and parsing 1,885 web pages for the relevant song content, and serving them through a website to a client application, along with storing them in an SQLite database to allow searching.</p>
    <p>The hymns are available for free at <a href="http://www.hymnal.net" target="_blank">hymnal.net</a>. There is also a mobile download already available, an epub file that can be read by the <a href="http://www.isilo.com/">iSilo</a> reader.</p>
    <p>But I wanted to experiment with scraping websites and displaying them on client screens like smartphones compactly. I imagined that this could be applied to other websites as well, such as <a href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com" target="_blank">Ultimate Guitar</a>, which, I felt, could easily be scraped in the same way that I had the hymns site.</p>
    <p>My reasoning is that a website should not have a free, ad-supported site which can be viewed by a mobile device any time, but force user to buy an app to use it more conveniently, at the same time neglecting the mobile market completely with its website. Hymnal.net and UltimateGuitar were two websites that violated these principles.</p>
    <p>Having smartphone users buy an app to use the content of a freely available website is a model that seems backwards to me. Despite the development costs, a larger user base (with more advertising revenue!) and more convenience should be the priority for websites.</p>
    <p>I've now realized that there's no way that a website-scraping app that displays the content of webpages would never fly with copyright rules. But even as I found that my app will never be published, I saw how hymnal.net changed its site from the original clunky design to the current, <i>mobile-friendly</i> design. And I now have hope that in due time, the Web will become smartphone friendly, driven as it is by the market. But I also hope that I'll be able to be a part of that transition.</p>
