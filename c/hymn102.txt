["1 Why was a cup made?\nTo have a drink inside it.\nWhy was a shoe made?\nTo have a foot inside it.\nWhy was an envelope made?\nTo have a letter inside it.\nWhy were you and I made?\nTo have God's life in us.", "2 Why was a glove made?\nTo have a hand inside it.\nWhy was a purse made?\nTo have some coins inside it.\nWhy was a flower vase made?\nTo have some flowers inside it.\nWhy were you and I made?\nTo have God's life in us."]
