{"1": "Two eyes to see all that my Lord has made,
Two ears to listen to His holy Word.
Two feet to run the way of righteousness,
And my two hands for serving Christ my Lord.",
"2": "I have a mouth to praise the Lord of grace;
I have a heart to love the Lord my God;
I give myself, all that I am and have
To always love and serve the Lord my God."}
