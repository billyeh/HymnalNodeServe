["1 For I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\nFor I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\nGod made me specially; yes, very carefully,\nFor I am fearfully and wonderfully made!", "2 When God made the fish, He said and it was so.\nWhen God made the birds, He said and it was so.\nBut when it came to making man,\nHe formed him with His hands,\nFor I am fearfully and wonderfully made!"]
