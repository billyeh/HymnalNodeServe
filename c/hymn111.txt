{"1": "For I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
For I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
God made me specially; yes, very carefully,
For I am fearfully and wonderfully made!",
"2": "When God made the fish, He said and it was so.
When God made the birds, He said and it was so.
But when it came to making man,
He formed him with His hands,
For I am fearfully and wonderfully made!"}
