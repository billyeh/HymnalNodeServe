["nonum D-A-V-I-D, was a skillful shepherd boy, (just a boy,)\nWatching over sheep out in the night cold; (Brrrr!)\nSeeking for the one who left the sheepfold. (Ba a-a-a-a-a!)\nD-A-V-I-D, H-O-N-O-R-E-D\nHis God, his folks, his brothers and his country, too,\nDavid was the one the Lord had chosen!\nNone of his brothers, but the little, singing, shepherd boy:\nDavid was the one!", "copyright  2008 Bible StorySongs, Inc.
