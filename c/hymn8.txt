{"nonum": "D-A-V-I-D, was a skillful shepherd boy, (just a boy,)
Watching over sheep out in the night cold; (Brrrr!)
Seeking for the one who left the sheepfold. (Ba a-a-a-a-a!)
D-A-V-I-D, H-O-N-O-R-E-D
His God, his folks, his brothers and his country, too,
David was the one the Lord had chosen!
None of his brothers, but the little, singing, shepherd boy:
David was the one!",
