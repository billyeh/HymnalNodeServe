Foundations of the earth He laid.
And His great power was displayed-
The angels sang for joy.",

The angels sang for joy.",

And then God said, Let there be light,
And there was light, yes, there was light,
And God saw it was good.",

And God saw it was good,
Let there be light: "and there was light,
And God saw it was good."}
