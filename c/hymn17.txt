{"1": "Matthew, the gospel of Jesus, the Christ, who
Came as the King to establish His kingdom.
Recommended and anointed, tested,
Tried, and still rejected,
Jesus, kingly Savior!
His ministry, parables,
Healing, authority,
Crucifixion, then rising in vict'ry:
Sowed He forth the kingdom seed,
He's coming back some day to reap it!
Jesus, King of Kings!",
