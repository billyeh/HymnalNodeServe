{"1": "He didn't stay home;
He went and visited people.
He didn't stay home;
Jesus taught disciples.
Fed the following crowd outdoors;
Made them glad forevermore;
Serving's what His life was for;
He didn't stay home. SO!!!!!",
"2": "Don't stay home! (go, go!)
Go and visit people!
Don't stay home! (go, go!)
Go and teach disciples. (GO!)
Fix some food, go out the door;
Make them glad forevermore;
Serving is what life is for,
So DON'T STAY HOME!!",
