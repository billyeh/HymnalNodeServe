["1 You come to me with a sword and a spear,\nBut I come to you in the name of the God of the ranks of Israel,\nWhom you've defied, but on this day\nJehovah will deliver you into my hand!", "2 It's not by sword (or shield) that Jehovah saves,\nFor the battle is the Lord's, He will prevail!\nThen all our shame will be turned away;\nAnd all the earth will know there's a God in Israel!", "3 The giant rose and came to fight,\nAnd David hurried, running to the battle line!\nHe chose a stone from the five in his sack\nAnd slung it quickly at that giant, just in time!", "4 Goliath tall had a giant fall!\nBrave David won that day with just a stone and sling!\nTheir giant dead, the Philistines fled,\nAnd Israel chased them that whole day far, far away!", "copyright  2008 Bible StorySongs, Inc.
