{"1": "You come to me with a sword and a spear,
But I come to you in the name of the God of the ranks of Israel,
Whom you've defied, but on this day
Jehovah will deliver you into my hand!",
"2": "It's not by sword (or shield) that Jehovah saves,
For the battle is the Lord's, He will prevail!
Then all our shame will be turned away;
And all the earth will know there's a God in Israel!",
"3": "The giant rose and came to fight,
And David hurried, running to the battle line!
He chose a stone from the five in his sack
And slung it quickly at that giant, just in time!",
"4": "Goliath tall had a giant fall!
Brave David won that day with just a stone and sling!
Their giant dead, the Philistines fled,
And Israel chased them that whole day far, far away!",
