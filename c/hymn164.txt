{"1": ""Give," said the little stream,
"Give," oh, give, give, oh, give,
Give," said the little stream,
As it hurried down the hill;
"I'm small, I know, but wherever I go,
The fields grow greener still."",
"chorus": "Singing, singing all the day,
"Give away, oh, give away,"
Singing, singing all the day,
"Give, oh, give away."",
"2": ""Give," said the little rain,
"Give, oh, give, give, oh, give,
Give," said the little rain
As it fell upon the flowers.
"I'll raise their drooping heads again,"
As it fell upon the flowers.",
"3": ""Give," then, what you can give,
"Give, oh, give, give, oh, give,
Give," then, what you can give,
There is something all can give.
Do as the streams and blossoms do,
And for other people live."}
