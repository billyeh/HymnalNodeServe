["1 May your spirit and your soul\nAnd your body be preserved,\nTo the coming of the Lord,\nBe preserved! Be preserved!\nYour whole spirit and whole soul\nAnd your body be preserved,\nBe kept blameless till He comes,\nBe preserved! Be preserved!", "2 There's an outer part of me-\nThat's my body-you can see,\nBut there's more to me than this-\nMore than this, more than this.\nYes, my body's where I live-\nLike my house, I am inside,\nLike the clothes that I may wear,\nI'm inside! I'm inside!", "3 Deeper than the part you see\nIs my soul-yes, that is me!\nAnd this soul has its own parts:\nMind and will! Feelings, too!\nWith my soul I feel and think,\nWith this soul my choices make,\nWith my soul I love and choose-\nLove the Lord! Choose the Lord!", "4 Deep within this inner part\nThere's a special part of me-\nIt's my spirit-for the Lord!\nDeepest part! For the Lord!\nThis one part just matches God-\nHere my conscience speaks for Him,\nIt's reserved just for the Lord-\nDeepest part! For the Lord!", "5 May your spirit and your soul\nAnd your body be preserved,\nYour whole being, sanctified\nBy our God! God of peace!\nWithout blame before the Lord,\nYour whole being, till He comes,\nBe kept blameless and so pure,\nBe preserved! Be preserved!"]
