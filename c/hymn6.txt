{"nonum": "Oh, the grass will wither and the flower fade,
But the word will stand forever.
Oh, the grass will wither and the flower fade,
But the word will stand forever.
In the beginning was the Word, the Word in the beginning.
The Word was with God, and the Word was God,
The Word in the beginning.
NOT... A.... jot or a tittle,
an iota or a serif will fail;
it stands forever;
Every jot, every tittle,
every serif and iota is firm,
it stands forever!",
