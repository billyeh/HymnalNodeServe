{"1": "Wonderful, wonderful!
God made me, wonderful!
When I look, I can see I'm just fine;
I'm designed perfectly.
Don't need change, no siree!
This same face has been in style
a long, long time.",
"2": "Ears that hear-they're so dear,
Nose to smell-very well,
And two eyes taking pictures",
constantly.
With my mouth, I can feed,
Drink and sing, and pray-read.
Thank you Lord you made me
wonderfully!"}
