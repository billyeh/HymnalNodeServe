{"1": "Jesus bids us shine with a clear, pure light,
Like a little candle burning in the night;
In this world of darkness, we must shine,
You in your small corner and I in mine.",
"2": "Jesus bids us shine, then, for all around
Many kinds of darkness in this world abound-
Sin and want and sorrow; we must shine,
You in your small corner, and I in mine."}
