For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong;
They are weak, but He is strong.",

Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
The Bible tells me so.",
"2": "Jesus, take this heart of mine;
Make it pure and wholly Thine.
Thou hast bled and died for me;
I will live henceforth for Thee.",
"chorus": "Yes, I love Jesus.
Yes, I love Jesus.
Yes, I love Jesus.
In prayer I tell Him so."}
