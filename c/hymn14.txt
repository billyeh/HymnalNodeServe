{"chorus": "In the ten commandments God gave us,
There's a promise found in one:
If we honor both our parents then
our days will be made long.",
"1": "All we think, (all we think!) all we do, (all we do)
All we choose and all we say,
We can show our honor for our folks,
When we cheerfully obey!",
"2": "Obey! (Obey!) Obey! (Obey!)
Obey our folks today. (today)
When we say, "Amen!" we honor them,
Let's cheerfully obey!",
