["1 Let's honor with manners!\nLet's honor each other today!\nIt's \"Yes, sir!\" and \"no, sir!\" and\n\"Yes, ma'am!\" and \"No, ma'am!\" and\nBefore we eat, let's pray!\n\"How do you do, sir?\" \"So glad to meet you!\"\nOpen the door and let her through. Oh,", "2 Let's honor with manners!\nLet's honor each other today!\nWe're vying in showing\nPoliteness and kindness,\nPreferring each other this way!\nSo we say, \"Please pass the potatoes.\"\nLet's keep our elbows off the table.
