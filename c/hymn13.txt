{"1": "Let's honor with manners!
Let's honor each other today!
It's "Yes, sir!" and "no, sir!" and",
"Yes, ma'am!" and "No, ma'am!" and
Before we eat, let's pray!",
"How do you do, sir?" "So glad to meet you!"
Open the door and let her through. Oh,",
"2": "Let's honor with manners!
Let's honor each other today!
We're vying in showing
Politeness and kindness,
Preferring each other this way!
So we say, "Please pass the potatoes."
Let's keep our elbows off the table. Oh,",
