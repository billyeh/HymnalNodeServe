{"nonum": "I'm spending time now,
Just me and my God!
I'm lingering longer;
Just me and my God!",
"nonum": "The sheep are a' snoring!
I'm singing and psalming!
My heart is a harp-sing
Unto my God!",
"nonum": "I'm spending time now,
Just me and my God!
I'm lingering longer;
Just me and my God!",
"nonum": "Your words are sweet as
Honey unto my taste,
And a light unto my path;
I'm lingering,
Just me and my God!",
